limited data on risks, disparity, and outcomes for COVID-19 in individuals suffering from SUD.", "This is a retrospective case- control study of electronic health records (EHRs) data of 73,099,850 unique patients, of whom 12,030 had a diagnosis of COVID-19.", "Patients with a recent diagnosis of SUD (within past year) were at significantly increased risk for COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio or AOR = 8.699 [8.411\u20138.997], P < 10\u221230), an effect that was strongest for individuals with OUD (AOR = 10.244 [9.107\u201311.524], P < 10\u221230), followed by individuals with tobacco use disorder (TUD) (AOR = 8.222 ([7.925\u20138.530], P < 10\u221230).", "Compared to patients without SUD, patients with SUD had significantly higher prevalence of chronic kidney, liver, lung diseases,

"Subject terms: Addiction, Diseases\n\n## Introduction\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has rapidly escalated into a global pandemic [1].", "The global pandemic of COVID-19 is colliding in the United States (US) with the epidemic of opioid use disorders (OUD) and overdose mortality [2\u20134].", "Currently, there is little if any quantitative analysis of the risks and outcomes for COVID-19 infection in individuals suffering from an OUD and those suffering from other substance use in the US.", "In addition, there is minimal data on how race and other demographic factors affect the risk and outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with SUD including OUD.", "It is estimated that more than 70,000 people will die in the US from an overdose in 2019 mostly from opioid overdoses, which are driven by the respiratory depressant effects of opioids.", "Considering that COVID-19 affects pulmonary function this combination could be particularly lethal.", "Additionally, ~10.8% of adults in the US have a substance use disorders (SUD) including alcohol (AUD) and tobacco (TUD) [5].", "To the extent that chronic use of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs is associated with cardiovascular (arrhythmias, cardiac insufficiency, and myocardial infarction), pulmonary (COPD, pulmonary hypertension), and metabolic diseases (diabetes, hypertension) [6\u201310] all of which are risk factors for COVID-19 infection and for worse outcomes [11\u201313] one can also predict that individuals with SUD including OUD would be at increased risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes [2].", "Preliminary reports regarding higher risk for adverse outcomes with COVID-19 and smoking have been inconclusive [14\u201316].", "Currently there is little research on the effects of other drugs including opioids, cannabis, cocaine and alcohol on the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and to adverse outcomes [2].", "## Material and methods\n\n### Database description\n\nWe performed a retrospective case-control study using de-identified population-level electronic health record (EHR) data collected by the IBM Watson Health Explorys from 360 hospitals and 317,000 providers across 50 states in the US since 1999 [17].", "The EHRs are de-identified according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act standards.", "After the de- identification process, curation process normalizes the data through mapping key elements to widely-accepted standards [18].", "Specifically, disease terms are coded using the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT), a global standard for health terms that provides the core general terminology for EHRs [19].", "Previous studies showed that with this large-scale and standardized EHR database, large case-control studies can be undertaken efficiently [20\u201324], including our recent studies [23, 24].", "### Study population\n\nAt the time of this study (June 15, 2020), the study population consisted of 73,099,850 unique patients, including 7,510,380 patients

1880 patients with lifetime diagnosis of SUD and COVID-19, and 1050 with recent SUD diagnosis and COVID-19.", "The status of COVID-19 was based on the concept \u201cCoronavirus infection (disorder)\u201d (SNOMED- CT Concept Code 186747009) and we further limited the diagnosis time frame to within the past year to capture the timing of new cases arising during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "The outcome measures were COVID-19 diagnosis, rates of death, and hospitalization.", "The specific types of SUD examined included alcohol use disorder (AUD), OUD, tobacco use disorder (TUD), cannabis use disorder (CUD), and cocaine use disorder (Cocaine-UD).", "Other types of SUDs were not investigated due to their small number of COVID-19 cases.", "The status of \u201cSUD\u201d was based on

categorized into two groups: patients with a lifetime diagnosis of SUD (diagnosed within past year or prior) and patients with a \u201crecent\u201d SUD (diagnosed within the past year).", "The first group represents patients with any SUD diagnosis (active or recovered).", "The second group is a subset of the first group but more likely consists of patients with active SUD.", "Through this manuscript we use the term SUD, following DSM-5 [25], which combines the prior categories of substance abuse and substance dependence from DSM-4.", "The following analyses were performed: (1) we examined if patients diagnosed with SUD were at increased the risk for COVID-19, adjusted for age, gender, race, and insurance type.", "The exposure groups were patients diagnosed with SUD, the unexposed groups were patients without SUD, and the outcome measure was diagnosis of COVID-19.", "Separate analyses were done for patients with a lifetime SUD diagnosis and for patients with a recent SUD.", "Separate analyses were done for subtypes of SUD.", "(2) We examined how demographic factors affected COVID-19 risk among patients with recent diagnosis of SUD.", "The case groups were patients with SUD and one of the following demographic factors: female, senior, African American.", "The comparison groups were patients with SUD and one of the following corresponding demographic factors (male, adult, Caucasian).", "The outcome measure was diagnosis of COVID-19.", "(3) We examined rates of death and hospitalization among patients with COVID-19 and SUD and compared outcomes of African Americans to those of Caucasians with SUD.", "### Statistical analysis\n\nThe adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 95% CI and P values were calculated using the Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel method [26] by controlling for age groups (juniors age <18 years, adults age 18\u201365 years, senior age > 65 years), gender (female, male), race (Caucasian, African American), and insurance type (private,

to screen and treat SUD as part of the strategy to control the pandemic while ensuring that there are no disparities in access to healthcare support for African Americans.", "In the Explorys EHR database, 10.3% of the study population had a diagnosis of SUD, which is similar to the reported prevalence of 10.8% among people aged 18 or older in the US according to the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) [5].", "However the prevalence rates for SUD subtypes from the Explorys EHR database was lower than for NSDUH (12 years or older population) except for OUD and Cocaine-UD.", "For TUD the rate was 10.40%, which is also lower than 13.7% of current cigarette smokers in the US adult population [27].", "These discrepancies are likely to be caused by the failure of the health system to adequately screen for and accurately diagnose SUDs, which could have significantly under-estimated the risk of patients with SUD for COVID-19 illness and adverse outcomes.", "The analyses showed that a recent diagnosis of SUD significantly increased the risk of COVID-19 that was highest for recent diagnosis of OUD followed by TUD, AUD and Cocaine-UD, and lowest for CUD.", "Patients with both SUD and COVID-19 also had significantly worse outcomes (death, hospitalization) than general COVID-19 patients.", "Compared to patients without SUD, patients with recent SUD had significantly higher prevalence of chronic kidney, liver, lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer.", "However, the prevalence of known risk factor for COVID-19 among patients with OUD was not higher than patients with other types of SUD.", "These results suggest that while comorbidities associated with SUD likely contributed to the increased risk of COVID-19 and to worse outcomes among SUD patients, specific pharmacological effects of drugs of abuse (e.g., opioid induced respiratory depression) as well as behavioral and socioeconomic factors could facilitate COVID-19 infection and increase risk for adverse outcomes.", "Among patients with recent diagnosis of SUD, African Americans had significantly higher risk of COVID-19 than Caucasians, an effect that was strongest for African Americans with OUD and they also had worse outcomes (death and hospitalizations).", "This is consistent with data from states and counties across the US showing that the coronavirus affects African Americans at a disproportionately high rate and that the they suffer a greater death toll [28\u201331].", "We showed that adult African Americans with recent diagnosis of SUDs had higher prevalence of asthma, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity and HIV compared to adult Caucasians.", "These enriched comorbidities in African Americans with SUD could underly their higher susceptibility to COVID-19 and their risk for adverse COVID outcomes along with socioeconomic disparities.", "However, these comorbidities alone may not be sufficient to explain the observed several-fold increase of COVID-19 diagnosis in African Americans as compared to Caucasians or their increased death rates.", "Other factors including access to healthcare, socioeconomic status and other social adversity components may have contributed negatively to their increased risk of COVID-19 as well as to the adverse outcomes.", "Consistent with other reports [12, 13], our study showed that seniors were more likely to develop COVID-19 than adults, which was also expected since hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and weakened immune function are more common in seniors than in adults.", "No disparity was observed for gender.", "Our study is based on retrospective analysis of patient EHR data.", "Patient EHR data have been widely used and accepted for observational studies including health utilization, drug utilization, epidemiology (incidence/prevalence), risk factors, and safety surveillance [32\u201334].", "However patient EHR data have inherent limitations when used for research purposes: data are collected for billing purposes, often suffer from under, over, or misdiagnosis, do not include all confounding factors, have limited time-series information, limited information of medication adherence and patient outcomes, among others.", "The Explorys EHR Database collects data from multiple health information systems.", "Since EHR adoption and health IT use generally lags in rural areas due to lack of financial and technical resources, patients from rural areas are likely less represented in our study population.", "In our study, disease diagnoses in the patient EHR data were coded using SNOMED-CT terminology and for SUD these differ from categories used by DSM-5.", "A further limitation of our study is that \u201cCOVID-19\u201d (Concept ID 840539006) was not yet included the Explorys EHRs database at the time of this study.", "This new concept was first included in the March 2020 SNOMED-CT International Edition Interim Release, with a planned update in July, 2020 [35].", "At the time of this study, this update has not been yet incorporated in Explorys EHRs.", "Despite these limitations, this large nationwide database allows us to assess a wide population helping us identify large trends (not necessarily for accurate prevalence estimation) in risks, disparities and outcomes of COVID-19 in SUD patients engaged with healthcare systems.", "A major limitation for this and other studies of COVID-19 has been the limited number of individuals who are tested for COVID-19, which can underestimate prevalence in the general population.", "For our study this is further confounded by the likelihood that patients with pulmonary, cardiac, metabolic or immune conditions, many of which are co-morbid with SUD, might have been more likely to be tested.", "It is also confounded by the likelihood that patients with specific SUDs (e.g., Cocaine-UD and OUD) might have been less likely to be tested due to socioeconomic factors or stigma.", "Widespread accessibility to COVID-19 testing in the future will allow more accurate comparisons of COVID prevalence between those with and without SUD.", "Additional limitations for this study include: (1) possible ascertainment bias as illicit SUD might have been underreported and individuals with SUD particularly illicit SUD are less likely to access healthcare, which would result in their lower representation in EHR, (2) the EHR database did not encode for current or active drug use, which is why we relied on a recent SUD diagnoses assuming that those patients were more likely to be active drug users, and (3) due to limited information of socioeconomic information on the EHR data, we were unable to assess the effects of social adversity and its interaction with medical conditions to COVID-19 risk, race disparity and adverse outcomes among patients with SUD.", "Social adversity is likely to have contributed not only to the higher risk for COVID-19 among patients with SUD but also to the even higher risk among African Americans patients with SUD.", "In our study, we showed that patients with SUDs has significantly higher prevalence of comorbidities, which are known risk factors for COVID-19, as compared to patients without SUDs.", "Our study did not control for these comorbidities when assessing the risk associations between SUD and COVID-19 for two main reasons.", "First, the central hypothesis of this study was that comorbidities associated with SUD, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic kidney, lung, and liver diseases, largely contributed to patients\u2019 risk to COVID-19 and its adverse outcomes.", "Second, due to limited sample sizes for COVID-19 cases among patients with SUD (1880 cases for all SUD and 210 for OUD), the large number of SUD-associated comorbidities, as well as inter-dependency among comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, and obesity), we are currently unable to control for these comorbidities as well as their associated medications, behaviors and other socioeconomic factors in order to assess the direct effects of addictive drugs or of SUD as a disease entity on COVID-19 risk.", "As more COVID-19 related data will be captured by EHR databases in the future, we will be able to investigate how SUD contributes to COVID-19 risk and outcomes in finer-grained details.", "In summary, our findings at a macroscopic level provide evidence that SUD should be considered a condition that increases risk for COVID-19, a comorbidity that has particularly deleterious effects to African Americans.", "This has implication to healthcare as it relates to expanding testing and making decisions of who might need hospitalizations.", "Similarly, when vaccine or other treatments become available, this has implication for deciding who is at greater risk.", "They also highlight the exacerbation of healthcare disparities from COVID-19 driven by social and economic factors that place certain groups at increased risks for both SUD as well as risk and adverse outcomes from COVID-19.", "Finally, our findings also underscore the importance of providing support for the treatment and recovery of individuals with SUD as part of the strategy to control the COVID pandemic.", "## Acknowledgements\n\nRX
