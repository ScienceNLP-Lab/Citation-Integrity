["## Abstract", "\n\nTo extend understanding of the genetic architecture and molecular basis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), we conducted a meta-analysis of genetic variants on the Metabochip involving 34,840 cases and 114,981 controls, overwhelmingly of European descent.", "We identified ten previously unreported T2D susceptibility loci, including two demonstrating sex-differentiated association.", "Genome-wide analyses of these data are consistent with a long tail of further common variant loci explaining much of the variation in susceptibility to T2D.", "Exploration of the enlarged set of susceptibility loci implicates several processes, including CREBBP-related transcription, adipocytokine signalling and cell cycle regulation, in diabetes pathogenesis.", "##\n\n", "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disease with multifactorial pathogenesis1.", "Although the genetic contribution to T2D is well recognized, the current set of 56 established susceptibility loci, identified primarily through large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS)2\u201311, captures at best 10% of familial aggregation of the disease.", "The characteristics (effect sizes and risk allele frequencies (RAF)) of the variants contributing to the \u201cunexplained\u201d genetic variance remain far from clear.", "At the same time, difficulties in inferring biological mechanisms from the variants of modest effect identified by GWAS have inhibited progress in defining the pathophysiological basis of disease susceptibility.", "One key question is whether characterization of increasing numbers of risk loci will provide evidence, at the functional level, that susceptibility involves a limited set of molecular processes.", "\n\nTo extend the discovery and characterization of variants influencing T2D susceptibility, we performed large-scale genotyping using the Metabochip.", "This custom array of 196,725 variants was designed to facilitate cost-effective follow-up of nominal associations for T2D and other metabolic and cardiovascular traits, and to enhance fine-mapping of established loci12.", "The T2D-nominated component of Metabochip comprises 21,774 variants, including 5,057 \u201creplication\u201d SNPs that capture the strongest, independent (CEU r2< 0.2) autosomal association signals from the GWAS meta-analysis conducted by the DIAbetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium.", "This genome-wide meta-analysis (\u201cDIAGRAMv3\u201d) includes data from 12,171 cases and 56,862 controls of European descent imputed up to 2.5

includes a further 16,717 variants, most chosen from 1000 Genomes Project pilot data13, to fine-map 27 established susceptibility loci.", "## RESULTS", "\n\n### Study overview\n\nOur primary investigation combined the DIAGRAMv3 (\u201cStage 1\u201d) GWAS meta- analysis with a \u201cStage 2\u201d meta-analysis comprising 22,669 cases and 58,119 controls genotyped with Metabochip, including 1,178 cases and 2,472 controls of Pakistani descent (PROMIS) (Online Methods and Supplementary Table 1).", "There was little evidence of heterogeneity in allelic effects between European- and Pakistani-descent studies in Stage 2 (Supplementary Fig. 1), so we report the combined meta-analysis including PROMIS with genomic control correction", ".", "\n\n### T2D susceptibility loci reaching genome-wide significance\n\nCombining Stage 1 and Stage 2 meta-analyses (Supplementary Fig. 2), we identified eight new T2D susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance (P < 5 \u00d7 10\u22128) (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2).", "By convention, we have labelled loci according to the gene nearest to the lead SNP, unless a compelling biological candidate maps nearby.", "The strongest signals mapped to ZMIZ1 (P = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221210), ANK1 (P = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221210), and the region flanking KLHDC5 (P = 6.1 \u00d7 10\u221210).", "We also observed genome-wide significant association at HMG20A (P = 4.6 \u00d7 10\u22129) and GRB14 (P = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22128), both implicated in a recent meta-analysis of T2D in South Asians10.", "Neither has previously been reported in European studies, and both remain genome-wide significant after removing PROMIS from the meta-analysis (HMG20A P = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22129; GRB14 P = 5.8 \u00d7 10\u22129).", "The lead SNPs from both meta-analyses are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (HMG20A r2 = 0.89 and GRB14 r2 = 0.77 in CEU), and likely represent the same association signals.", "At the previously unreported loci, we observed nominal evidence of association (P < 0.05) in the South Asian10 and recent East Asian11 meta-analyses for the lead SNPs at MC4R and ZMIZ1 (Supplementary Table 3), with

likely set a lower bound to the overall liability-scale variance attributable to common SNPs.", "The mixture model does not take account loci not represented by Metabochip T2D replication SNPs due to failures in array design or manufacture or because the association signal in DIAGRAMv3 was too weak to merit inclusion.", "Indeed, the latter applied to two of the genome- wide significant loci, ANKRD55 and GRB14, which were nominated for inclusion on Metabochip because of associations with WHR (ANKRD55 and GRB14), blood pressure (ANKRD55) and plasma lipid concentrations (GRB14), rather than T2D.", "\n\nTo estimate the contribution to the variance explained by common variants genome-wide, we undertook polygenic mixed linear modelling analyses using GCTA21, 22 in two DIAGRAMv3 GWAS data sets: DGI (1,022 cases, 1,075 controls) and WTCCC (1,924 cases, 2,938 controls).", "The estimated liability-scale variance explained by the full set of GWAS SNPs was consistent between the two studies: 62.6% for DGI (95% CI 38.1\u201387.1%) and 63.9% for WTCCC (95% CI 52.1\u201375.8%).", "These results are similar to those obtained from a complementary method integrating polygenic risk score analysis and approximate Bayesian computation23 applied to the DIAGRAMv2 meta-analysis4, which estimated that ~49% of liability-scale variance was explained by common variants genome-wide.", "These data indicate that a substantial proportion of the variation in T2D risk is captured by common variant association signals that, individually, lie beyond unequivocal detection in single SNP analyses.", "The DIAGRAMv2 meta-analysis4 had provided some evidence for loci harboring multiple independent association signals.", "To understand the extent to which additional variance might be attributable to multiple variants at established and newly discovered loci, we extended these analyses, focusing on the detection of independent (CEU r2 < 0.05) association signals that lie outside the recombination interval containing the lead SNP (Supplementary Table 2).", "We detected two loci at which multiple independent association signals attained genome-wide significance: KCNQ1 (rs163184, P = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221211; rs231361, P = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22129; CEU r2 = 0.01) and CDKN2A/B (rs10811661, P = 3.7 \u00d7 10\u221227; rs944801, P = 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22129; CEU r2 = 0.01) (Fig.

transcript, has not previously been implicated in T2D susceptibility.", "This signal is independent of the previously reported haplotype effect at the primary T2D signal at this locus, which is itself likely due to the phase relationships between two clades of partially correlated variants25,26.", "We also observed putative independent associations (P < 10\u22125) at DGKB (rs17168486, P = 5.9

that multiple independent association signals are widespread at T2D susceptibility loci.", "Imputation up to the more complete reference panels emerging from the 1000 Genomes Project13 and recently developed approaches that support approximate conditional analyses using meta- analysis summary level data27 will be important tools for documenting the full extent of such effects, especially where

causal low-frequency alleles at any single locus.", "However, the paucity of low-frequency candidate alleles across 36 loci suggests that most causal variants at these loci are common.", "A contribution of even rarer causal alleles (too rare to be represented on Metabochip) is also unlikely because the substantial effect sizes required to drive common variant association signals are
