infection with therapeutic implication (Sallard et al., 2020).", "Little data is currently available about the impact of aging on CD4+ and CD8 + T cell responses in COVID-19.", "It is postulated that age-related decline of de novo T cell responsiveness and/or impact from comorbid conditions, particularly persistent viral infections such as chronic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection could serve as potential causes of COVID-19 vulnerability in older adults (Kadambari et al., 2020; Moss, 2020; Nicoli et al., 2020).", "Available data on humoral immunity are fascinating and counter-intuitive.", "Among COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors, Klein et al. observed higher SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing and IgG antibody titers in older donors compared with their young counterparts (Klein et al., 2020).", "In a study cited above, Zhang et al. also described the correlation between greater anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers and older age (Zhang et al., 2020b).", "The reason for these observations is unknown at the present time and deserves further investigation.", "Substantial evidence supports the role of immunopathology in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 overall as described above.", "Based on their review of data on immune changes published during the early stage of this pandemic, Lin and colleagues proposed a hypothesis for the role of immune and inflammatory factors in contributing to dysregulation of the coagulation system in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and suggested intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulant therapy (Lin et al., 2020).", "Studies also suggested a link between complement activation and endothelial dysfunction, likely the key to microvascular thrombosis and multi-organ failure in severe COVID-19 (Mackman et al., 2020; Magro et al., 2020; Noris et al., 2020).", "However, few studies are available with a focus on aging.", "Inflammaging is well documented and can be derived from senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), persistent viral infection such as CMV, and other potential sources (Chen et al., 2019; Franceschi et al., 2000; Franceschi and Campisi, 2014).", "Such an unbalanced pro-inflammatory environment could potentiate further inflammatory responses upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to the development of an exacerbated cytokine storm in older adults.", "It may also influence ACE2 expression and facilitate viral entry (Radzikowska et al., 2020).", "Further studies are urgently needed to address this important mechanism with a focus on aging.", "Children are overwhelmingly spared from severe COVID-19 disease except for the extremely rare occurrence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), also called Kawasaki disease-like syndrome (Lingappan et al., 2020; Viner and Whittaker, 2020).", "Insights into children\u2019s defense mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 infection may shed light on age-related vulnerability in older adults from a different perspective.", "For example, Chen et al. observed significantly higher counts of total as well as both CD4+ and CD8 + T cells in pediatric COVID-19 cases relative to adult cases (Chen et al., 2020b).", "On the other hand, children with COVID-19 manifested lower levels of T cell activation than adult COVID-19 patients (Moratto et al., 2020), suggesting better immune system control and regulation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.", "Thymic function likely plays an important role in preserving T cells in COVID-19 (Rehman et al., 2020).", "In fact, Liu et al. showed that thymosin \u03b11 reversed lymphopenia, reversed exhausted T cells and reduced mortality of severe COVID-19 in adults (Liu et al., 2020b).", "In addition, children demonstrate strong innate immunity despite the fact that the immune system as a whole is yet to be fully developed.", "One possibility is \u201ctrained immunity\u201d through scheduled immunization with many doses of pediatric vaccines (Netea et al., 2020).", "Whether this can be applicable in older adults (i.e., potential protective effect from immunization with other unrelated vaccines such as influenza vaccine) remain to be investigated.", "Challenges\n\nDespite the large number of research papers including preprints that are published almost every day, it remains a difficult task to obtain reliable knowledge of COVID-19 that is accurate and precise.", "Conflicting data and results that are not reproducible are not uncommon.", "Here we discuss a few inherent difficulties that present themselves as great challenges for immune studies of COVID-19, reminding readers to critically evaluate the literature and putting published results in appropriate context.", "This is especially true for assessing COVID-19 information in social media, particularly in the current environment of rapid dissemination of misinformation and disinformation.", "First, SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly heterogeneous, from asymptomatic infection to mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19.", "In addition, the infection can evolve through different stages and progress in either direction (improving and recovery versus worsening and death).", "Most published immunological studies are cross-sectional and at one time point with a relatively small sample size.", "Although immunological analysis itself can be cutting edge and in-depth, the results from these studies are only valid in the context of the study with limited generalizability.", "Asymptomatic SARS- CoV-2 infection can be a challenge in selecting \u201chealthy controls\u201d as well.", "Due to lack of universal COVID-19 testing, it is difficult to know whether people are truly \u201chealthy\u201d (uninfected) or asymptomatic.", "Secondly, complex impact of aging on the immune system and influences from comorbid conditions and concomitant use of medications may all contribute to the heterogeneity of the data on T-cell immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 (Mathew et al., 2020).", "Finally, there is a high-sequence similarity in viral proteins (e.g., nuclear protein) between SARS-CoV-2 and other \u03b2 coronaviruses (e.g. 229E strain) (Chan et al., 2020).", "As such, prior coronavirus infections may induce heterotypic cellular immunity against COVID-19.", "This heterotypic cellular immune response may further complicate COVID-19 immunological studies and interpretation of their results.", "Therefore, it is important to take these challenges into consideration in interpretation of published data as well as in design and implementation of immunological and interventional studies including COVID-19 vaccine development.", "Vaccination\n\nEffective and safe vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is the best strategy to stop viral spread and control the pandemic.", "Intense worldwide efforts for COVID-19 vaccine development began after the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was published on January 11th 2020, and has since advanced at previously unimaginable speed with the first vaccine candidate entering human clinical trials on March 16th.", "The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), founded in 2017, works with health authorities and vaccine developers and plays an important role in this global effort.", "On May 15th, the US federal government announced \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d, a public\u2013private partnership involving the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Department of Defense, and other government agencies, whose objective is to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.", "There are more than 200 vaccine candidates under development, ten of which are in human clinical trials (Lurie et al., 2020).", "A striking feature of this global effort is the diverse vaccine development platforms, from the traditional inactivated or live attenuated virus, viral protein subunit, to replicating or non-replicating viral vectors and novel platforms based on DNA or mRNA (Thanh Le et al., 2020).", "An advantage of the traditional vaccine platform is that this is a mature technology that has already been employed in the production of licensed vaccines with existing large-scale production capacity (recombinant viral protein subunits).", "Moreover, adjuvant addition is possible, which can enhance immunogenicity and make lower doses viable, thereby enabling vaccination of more people without compromising protection.", "On the other hand, vaccines based on viral vectors offer a high level of antigenic epitopes expressed by the vector and long-term stability with the likelihood of inducing strong immune responses.", "Novel vaccine platforms based on DNA or mRNA enable great flexibility in terms of antigen manipulation and potential for speed.", "In fact, an mRNA-based vaccine (mRNA-1273) made by Moderna entered human clinical trials just two months after the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome sequence became available and demonstrated promising preliminary results (Jackson et al., 2020).", "Two phase 1/2 clinical trials of two different adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines have reported robust antibody and T-cell responses to the vaccines with acceptable side effects in healthy adults (Folegatti et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020a).", "However, the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine trial was conducted among adults of 18\u201355 years of age with no enrollment of older adults (Folegatti et al., 2020).", "Despite progress that has been made thus far, significant challenges lie ahead.", "For example, while focusing on the vaccine itself is important, attention must also be directed to the host.", "Because of the lack of in-depth knowledge about the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, no specific immune parameter(s) of vaccine potency, or correlates of protection, are currently available.", "The phenomenon of ADE discussed above (Arvin et al., 2020), also deserves careful consideration (Lambert et al., 2020).", "Aging is a critical host factor to consider in the context of vaccination responses (Pawelec and Weng, 2020).", "It may be necessary to develop different vaccines on specific vaccine platforms for older adults versus those for children and young adults.", "In the case of influenza vaccination, the standard dose of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3), the only influenza vaccine available for older adults for many years before the approval of high- dose and adjuvanted influenza vaccines, showed questionable effectiveness, if at all, for the elderly, particularly those who are frail and need vaccine protection the most (Yao et al., 2011).", "Over a century after the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, the worst pandemic in human history, we are still in search of a universal influenza vaccine (Paules et al., 2017).", "The ongoing pandemic poses special challenges (Diamond and Pierson, 2020).", "For vaccine trials, levels of pandemic activity as well as various quarantine measures and their implementation significantly impact study enrollment, protection of both research staff and participants, and other trial logistics.", "Because of the low level of pandemic activity in China, COVID-19 vaccine trials are not feasible at the present time, even for vaccines that were developed in China.", "When a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, the demand of the ongoing pandemic can post huge challenges on large-scale production and distribution of the vaccine.", "Addressing these and other challenges requires global corporation and coordination among governments, academia, and industry.", "With rapid progress in COVID-19 vaccine development, it is promising and hopeful that there will be one or several safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in the near future. But the public should be fully educated about the alternative reality, that is, we may not have such a vaccine for a long time, if ever.", "To that end, authorities have begun to develop protective programs against COVID-19 outbreaks at nursing homes, the setting with arguably highest risk for older adults as described above.", "For example, in May 2020, the Pennsylvania State legislature has approved $175 million to establish a statewide Regional Response Health Collaborative Program (RRHCP, https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/DHS_details.aspx?newsid=569).", "Pennsylvania State University was awarded nearly $23 million to support 244 nursing homes, assisted living and personal care homes in the Southcentral region of Pennsylvania to combat COVID-19 outbreaks and support mitigation measures should COVID-19 be present at these facilities.", "RRHCP provides a wide range of COVID-19 related clinical and public health supportive services, such as testing performance and laboratory capacity, personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, infection prevention training and advising, rapid response teams for sites with an active COVID-19 outbreak, staffing support, alternate care settings, mental and behavioral health support for residents and staff, clinical support via telehealth and geriatrician site visits, contact tracing, and education through a statewide learning network [https://news.psu.edu/story/630235/2020/09/01/penn-state-health-receives- grant-mitigate-covid-19-care-facilities].", "As to the public, every one of us should adhere to social distancing and other quarantine measures that are known to be effective to prevent virus spread.", "A historical lesson from the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic is that compared to Philadelphia, St. Louis was able to minimize flu pandemic deaths and flatten the curve through its prompt and strictly enforced quarantine measures (Fig. 6 A) (Hatchett et al., 2007).", "The contemporary one is that Europe flattened the curve during the summer, 2020, while the US suffers ongoing COVID-19 resurgence (Fig. 6B) (Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, 2020).", "We should all learn from them.", "Fig. 6\n\nDeath curves in Philadelphia and St. Louis during 1918 Spanish flu pandemic (panel A, adapted from Hatchett RJ, et al.
