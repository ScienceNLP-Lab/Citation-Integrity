["## Abstract\n\nRecent studies have reported protective efficacy of both natural immunity1 and vaccine-induced immunity2\u20137 against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) challenge in rhesus macaques.", "However, the importance of humoral and cellular immunity for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be determined.", "Here we show that adoptive transfer of purified IgG from convalescent macaques protects na\u00efve recipient rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a dose dependent fashion.", "Depletion of CD8+ T cells in convalescent animals partially abrogated the protective efficacy of natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2 re-challenge, suggesting the importance of cellular immunity in the context of waning or subprotective antibody titers.", "These data demonstrate that relatively low antibody titers are sufficient for protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques, and that cellular immune responses may also contribute to protection if antibody responses are suboptimal.", "We also show that higher antibody titers are required for therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques.", "These findings have important implications for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and immune- based therapeutics.", "##\n\nThe protective efficacy of several SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates2\u20137 and the protective efficacy of natural immunity against re-exposure to SARS-CoV-21 have recently been reported in rhesus macaques.", "Both neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers as well as Fc functional antibody responses correlated with protection4,5, but direct data demonstrating the immunologic determinants of protection have been lacking.", "In particular, the relative importance of humoral immunity, cellular immunity, and innate immunity in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been determined.", "Such knowledge would be important in the development of vaccines, antibody-based therapeutics, and public health strategies.", "## IgG Adoptive Transfer Protection Study\n\nWe previously reported that 9 rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal and intratracheal routes were protected against SARS-CoV-2 re- challenge1.", "Following re-challenge, these animals developed increased log10 neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers of 2.56\u20133.38 (median 3.07) using a luciferase-based pseudovirus neutralization assay1,4,8 (Extended Data Fig. 1).", "To develop a high titer IgG stock for adoptive transfer studies, we purified IgG from plasma from each of these 9 animals and prepared individual IgG stocks at concentrations of 10 mg/ml.", "These stocks had similar NAb titers as the original plasma samples (Extended Data Fig. 1).", "We then pooled these individual IgG stocks to create a combined IgG stock with a log10 NAb titer of 3.20 (NAb titer of 1,581).", "We assessed the protective efficacy of this purified IgG stock in an adoptive transfer study in rhesus macaques.", "12 Indian-origin male and female rhesus macaques (Extended Data Table 1) received an intravenous infusion with 250 mg/kg (Group I; N=3), 25 mg/kg (Group II; N=3), or 2.5 mg/kg (Group III; N=3) of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG stock or sham IgG (Group IV; N=3) on day \u22123.", "On day 0, all animals were challenged with 1.0\u00d7105 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal and intratracheal routes, as we have previously described5.",

similarly showed a titration of antibody titers in the recipient animals on day 0 (Extended Data Fig. 2b, \u200b,c).c).", "Following SARS-CoV-2 challenge, NAb and ELISA titers gradually decreased in Group I and in a subset of animals in Group II over the 14 days of follow-up.", "In contrast, NAb and ELISA titers increased sharply in Groups III and IV by day 10\u201314 following challenge, presumably reflecting the autologous antibody response to productive infection1.", "We profiled S-, RBD-, and nucleocapsid (N)-specific antibody responses in the recipient animals by systems serology9,10, as we previously observed diverse Fc functional antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals1.", "IgG subclasses, Fc-receptors (FcR2A-1, FcR2A-2, FcR3A), antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP), antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and antibody- dependent natural killer cell activation (ADNKA) responses were assessed.", "Consistent with the NAb and ELISA data, the antibody Fc effector profiles showed higher responses in Group I and marginal responses in Group III (Extended Data Fig. 3).", "Moreover, a principal component analysis (PCA) of the antibody features showed that animals in Group I separated from the other groups.", "To assess the protective efficacy of the adoptively transferred IgG, we assessed viral loads in BAL and NS by RT-PCR for subgenomic RNA (sgRNA), which is believed to measure replicating virus1,11.", "All sham controls in Group IV were infected and had a median peak of 5.18 (range 3.82\u20135.45) log10 sgRNA copies/ml in BAL (Fig. 1a) and a median peak of 5.72 (range 5.12\u20136.62) log10 sgRNA copies/ml in NS (Fig. 1b), consistent with our previous experience with this challenge stock1,4,5.", "As expected, viral replication was observed for 7\u201310 days in BAL and for 10\u201314 days in NS.", "All animals that received 2.5 mg/kg IgG in Group III were also infected but generally showed shorter duration of viral replication of 3\u201310 days in BAL and 7\u201310 days in NS.", "In contrast, 1 of 3 animals that received 25 mg/kg IgG in Group II and all animals that received 250 mg/kg IgG in Group I were protected with no detectable virus in BAL or NS at any timepoint following challenge (limit of quantitation 1.69 log10 sgRNA copies/ml or

implications for vaccines and immune-based therapeutics.", "Our data suggest the importance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to induce potent and durable humoral as well as cellular immune responses.", "We speculate that NAb titers above a certain threshold are sufficient for protection but that CD8+ T cells may also contribute to protection when NAb titers decline.", "It is possible, however, that the specific NAb threshold for protection identified in the present study (IC50 \u223c50) may be model-specific and may be dependent on technical details, such as donor plasma characteristics, challenge virus stock infectivity and inoculum dose, and recipient macaque specifics.", "Further adoptive transfer studies should be performed with IgG purified from plasma from vaccinated macaques or humans.", "The present data also demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of convalescent plasma for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is currently being explored in clinical trials12,13.", "However, our data should be interpreted cautiously, because only high serum NAb titers in recipient animals (approximately 500) showed therapeutic efficacy in this model, whereas lower serum NAb titers in recipient animals (approximately 50) did not have detectable efficacy.", "Such high serum NAb titers in recipient macaques likely exceed typical serum NAb titers achieved in human recipients of convalescent human plasma4,17, and thus implications for the clinical use of convalescent plasma for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain limited.", "Monoclonal antibodies achieve substantially higher neutralization titers than convalescent plasma.", "Our data provide a key proof-of-concept that antibodies can protect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a dose dependent fashion.", "If antibodies are near or below the threshold titer required for protection, then cellular immune responses may be important for rapid virologic control.", "Collectively, these data provide key insights into the
