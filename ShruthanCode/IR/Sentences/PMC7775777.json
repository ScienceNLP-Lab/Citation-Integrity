(18) notes that no study to date has successfully cultured live virus more than 9 days after the onset of symptoms.", "## RESULTS\n\n### Impact of repeated population screening on individuals\n\nTo examine how repeated population screening would reduce the average infectiousness of individuals, we first modeled the viral loads and infectiousness curves of 10,000 simulated individuals using the predicted viral trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 infections based on key features of latency, growth, peak, and decline identified in the literature (Fig. 1A; see Materials and Methods).", "Accounting for these within-host viral kinetics, we calculated what percentage of their total infectiousness would be removed by screening and isolation (Fig. 1B) with tests at LOD of 103 and 105 and at different testing frequencies.", "Here, infectiousness was taken to be proportional to the logarithm of viral load in excess of 106 cp/ml (with alternative assumptions addressed in sensitivity analyses; see the Supplementary Materials), consistent with the observation that presymptomatic patients are most infectious just before the onset of symptoms (21) and evidence that the efficiency of viral transmission coincides with peak viral loads, which was also identified during the related 2003 SARS outbreak (22, 23).", "We considered that 35% of patients would undergo symptomatic isolation within 3 days of their peak viral load if they had not been tested and isolated first, and 65% would have sufficiently mild or no symptoms such that they would not isolate unless they were detected by testing.", "On the basis of recent results, we modeled asymptomatic and symptomatic infections as having the same initial viral loads (1, 24\u201326) but with faster clearance among asymptomatics (see Materials and Methods) (24, 26\u201329).", "This analysis demonstrated that there was little difference in averting infectiousness between the two classes of test.", "Marked reductions in total infectiousness of the individuals were observed by testing daily or every third day, 62 to 66% reduction when testing weekly, and 45 to 47% under biweekly testing (Fig. 1C).", "Because viral loads and infectiousness vary across individuals, we also analyzed the impact of different screening regimens on the distribution of individuals\u2019 infectiousness, revealing that more sporadic testing leads to an increased likelihood that individuals will test positive after they are no longer infectious or be missed by testing entirely (Fig. 1D).", "### Impact of repeated screening on a population\n\nAbove, we assumed that each infection was independent.", "To investigate the effects of population screening strategies at the population level, we used simulations to monitor whether epidemics were contained or became uncontrolled while varying the frequencies at which the test was administered, ranging from daily testing to testing every 14 days, and considering tests with LOD of 103 and 105, analogous to RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP/rapid antigen tests, respectively.", "We integrated individual viral load trajectories into two different epidemiological models to ensure that important observations were independent of the specific modeling approach.", "The first model is a simple fully mixed model representing a population of 20,000, similar to a large university setting, with a constant rate of external infection approximately equal to one new import per day.", "The second model is a previously described agent-based model with both within-household and age-stratified contact structure based on census microdata in a city representative of New York City (30), which we initialized with 100 cases without additional external infections.", "Individual viral loads were simulated for each infection, and individuals who received a positive test result were isolated, but contact tracing and monitoring were not included to more conservatively estimate the impacts of screening alone (31, 32).", "Model details and parameters are fully described in Materials and Methods.", "We observed that a population screening regimen administering either test with high-frequency limited viral spread, measured by both a reduction in the reproductive number R (Fig. 2, A and B; see Materials and Methods for calculation procedure) and the total infections that persisted despite different screening programs, expressed relative to no screening (Fig. 2, C and D).", "Testing frequency was found to be the primary driver of population- level epidemic control, with only a small margin of improvement provided by using a more sensitive test.", "Direct examination of simulations showed that with no testing or biweekly testing, infections were uncontrolled, whereas screening weekly with either LOD = 103 or 105 effectively attenuated surges of infections (examples are shown in Fig. 3).", "Fig. 2\n\nRepeated population screening affects disease dynamics.", "Both the fully mixed compartmental model (top row) and agent-based model (bottom row) are affected by repeated population screening.", "(A and B) More frequent testing reduces the effective reproductive number R, shown as the percentage by which R0 is reduced, 100 \u00d7 (R0 \u2212 R)/R0.", "Values of R were estimated from 50 independent simulations of dynamics with 100% of the population participating (see Materials and Methods).", "(C and D) Relative to no testing (gray bars), screening suppresses the total number of infections in both models when testing every day or every 3 days but only partially mitigates total cases for weekly or biweekly testing.", "Error bars indicate inner 95% quantiles of 50 independent simulations each.", "Fig. 3\n\nExample simulation trajectories from fully mixed model with repeated population screening.", "Simulation trajectories show the number of infected individuals in a population of N = 20,000 with a constant rate of external infection set to 1/N per person per day, i.e., around one imported case per day, and full participation in the testing regimen.", "Infections are classified as freely mixing in the population (blue), isolated because of a positive test (black), or isolated because of symptoms (red) in four simulated example scenarios with R0 = 2.5.", "(A) No screening.

S1, A and B) and on R (fig. S1, C and D).", "In Fig. 2, we modeled infectiousness as proportional to log10 of viral load.", "To address whether these findings are sensitive to this modeled relationship, we performed similar simulations with infectiousness proportional to viral load (fig. S2) or uniform above 106/ml (fig. S3).", "We found that results were robust to these large variations in the modeled relationship between infectiousness and viral load.", "To further address whether our results depended on the exact 35% fraction of individuals assumed to be behaviorally symptomatic, we performed sensitivity analyses with fewer (20%) or more (50%) symptomatic individuals and found no meaningful difference in results (fig. S4).", "### Impact of delayed test results\n\nAn important variable in testing is the time between a test\u2019s sample collection and the reporting of a diagnosis.", "To examine how time to reporting affected epidemic control, we reanalyzed both the reduction in individuals\u2019 infectiousness and the epidemiological simulations, comparing the results of instantaneous reporting (reflecting a rapid point-of-care assay), 1-day delay, and 2-day delay (Fig. 4, A and B).", "Delays in reporting markedly decreased the reduction in infectiousness in individuals as seen by the total infectiousness removed (Fig. 4C), the distribution of infectiousness in individuals (Fig. 4D), or the dynamics of the epidemiological models (Fig. 5).", "This result was robust to the modeled relationship between infectiousness and viral load in both simulation models and for various test sensitivities and frequencies (fig.

S6A).", "Second, we varied the reproductive number R0 between infected individuals in both models and confirmed that at higher R0, more frequent screening is also required (fig. S6, B and C).", "This may be relevant to institutions like college campuses or military bases wherein frequent classroom setting or dormitory living is likely to increase contact rates.", "Thus, the specific strategy for successful population screening will depend on the current community infection prevalence and transmission rate.", "The generality of our findings to different epidemiological parameters (fig. S6), relationships between viral load and infectiousness (figs. S2 and S3), and proportion of symptomatic individuals (fig. S4) led us to ask whether a more general mathematical formula could predict R without requiring epidemiological simulation.", "We derived such a formula (text S1) and found that its predicted values of R were nearly perfectly correlated with simulation- estimated values (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.998, P < 10\u22126; fig. S7), providing a mathematical alternative to simulation-based sensitivity analyses.", "### Repeated population screening to mitigate an ongoing epidemic\n\nThe impact of repeated population screening on transmission dynamics led us to hypothesize that testing could be used as an active tool to mitigate an ongoing epidemic.", "To test this idea, we simulated an outbreak situation using both the fully mixed and agent-based models but with three additional conditions.", "First, we assumed that in an ongoing pandemic, other mitigating interventions would cause the reproductive number to be lower although nevertheless larger than one.", "Second, we considered that not all individuals would want to or be able to participate in a SARS-CoV-2 screening program.", "Third, we assumed that the collection of samples for testing, if performed on a large scale, could result in imperfect sample collection, causing an increase in the false-negative rate, independent of an assay\u2019s analytical sensitivity.", "These modifications are fully described in Materials and Methods.", "We simulated epidemics in which screening began only at the point when uncontrolled infections reached 4% prevalence.", "On the basis of results from our previous analyses, we considered a less sensitive but rapid test with LOD 105 cp/ml and a 0-day delay in results and further assumed that 10% of would- be positive samples would be negative because of improper sample collection.", "We then examined scenarios of testing every 3 days and every 7 days, with either 50 or 75% of individuals participating, starting from a partially mitigated R0 = 1.5.", "We found that testing 75% of individuals every 3 days was sufficient to drive the epidemic toward extinction within 6 weeks and reduce cumulative incidence by 88% and that other combinations also had successful but less rapid mitigating impacts, particularly when compared with no intervention (Fig. 6).", "Notably, even weekly testing with 50% participation was able to reduce the peak and length of the outbreak, illustrating how even partial screening using a test with 100\u00d7 lower molecular sensitivity than PCR can have public health benefits when used frequently (Fig. 6).", "Repeating these simulations using a test with LOD 106 led to similar results (fig. S8).", "To further generalize these results, we modified our mathematical formula to predict the impacts of per-individual test refusal and per-test sampling- related sensitivity on the reproductive number R (see text S1).", "Fig. 6\n\nRepeated population screening suppresses an ongoing epidemic.", "Widespread testing and isolation of infected individuals drive prevalence downward for both (A) the fully mixed compartmental model and (B) the agent- based model.", "Time series of prevalence, measured as the total number of infectious individuals, are shown for no intervention (solid) and population screening scenarios (various dashed lines; see legend) for individual stochastic simulations.", "Screening began only when prevalence reached 4% (box), and time series are shifted such that testing begins at t = 0.", "Scenarios show the impact of a test with LOD 105, no delay in results, and with 10% of samples assumed to be incorrectly collected (and therefore negative) to reflect decreased sensitivity incurred at sample collection in a mass testing scenario.", "Annotations show total number of post-intervention infections, as a percentage of the no-intervention scenario, labeled as 100% (see fig. S8 for identical simulations using a test with LOD 106).", "## DISCUSSION\n\nOur results lead us to conclude that repeated population screening of asymptomatic individuals can be used to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.", "However, our findings are subject to a number of limitations.", "First, the sensitivity of a test may depend on factors beyond LOD, including manufacturer variation and improper clinical sampling (33), although the latter may be ameliorated by different approaches to sample collection, such as saliva-based testing (34).", "Second, the exact performance differences between testing schemes will depend on whether our model truly captures viral kinetics and infectiousness profiles (21), particularly during the acceleration phase between exposure and peak viral load.", "Continued clarification of these within- host dynamics would increase the impact and value of this, and other (31, 32, 35, 36) modeling studies.", "Last, we modeled participation in screening regimens (or refusal thereof) as statistically independent between individuals, but health-related behaviors have been shown to be socially (37) and geographically (38, 39) correlated.", "Clustered refusal of testing or refusal to isolate upon testing positive could present challenging barriers to implementation.", "Our findings show that the impact of repeated population screening can be expressed as a reduction of the reproductive number R.

Each individual was chosen to be symptomatic independently with probability f, and each individual\u2019s first test day (e.g., the day of the week that their weekly test would occur) was chosen uniformly at random between 1 and D. Relative infectiousness was scaled up or down to achieve the specified R0 in the absence of any testing policy but inclusive of any assumed self-isolation of symptomatics.", "In each time step, those individuals who were marked for testing that day were tested, and a counter was initialized to T, specifying the number of days until that individual received their results.", "Next, individuals whose test result counters were zero were isolated, I \u2192 Q.

Then, all infected individuals contacted all susceptible individuals, with the probability of transmission based on that day\u2019s viral load V(t) for each person and the particular infectiousness function, described above, S \u2192 I. To conclude each time step, individuals\u2019 viral loads and test result counters were advanced, with those whose infectious period had completely passed moved to recovery, I, Q, SQ \u2192 R.\n\n#### Transmission, population structure, and mixing patterns: Agent-based model\n\nThe agent-based model added viral kinetics and testing policies (as described above) to an existing model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in New York City.", "A full description of the agent-based model is available (30); here, we provide an overview of the relevant transmission dynamics.", "Simulations were initialized with all individuals susceptible, except for 100 initially infected individuals, S = N \u2212 100.", "As in the fully mixed model, each individual\u2019s test day was chosen uniformly at random and relative infectiousness was scaled to achieve the specified R0.", "In each time step, those individuals who were marked for testing that day were tested, and a counter was initialized to T, specifying the number of days until that individual received their results.", "Next, individuals whose test result counters were zero were isolated, I \u2192 Q. There was no self-isolation in this model (and accordingly, the model did not label individuals as symptomatic or asymptomatic).", "Then, transmission from infected individuals to susceptible individuals was simulated both within and outside households.", "To model within-household transmission, each individual had a set of other individuals comprising their household.", "Household structures, along with the age of each individual, were sampled from census microdata for New York City (52).", "The probability for an infectious individual to infect each of their household members each day was determined by scaling the relative infectiousness values to match the estimated secondary attack rate for close household contacts previously reported in case cluster studies (53).", "Outside of household transmission was simulated using age-stratified contact matrices, which describe the expected number of daily contacts between an individual in a given age group and those in each other age group.", "Each infectious individual of age i drew Poisson(Mij) contacts with individuals in age group j, where M is the contact matrix.", "The contacted individuals were sampled uniformly at random from age group j. We use a contact matrix for the United States estimated in (54).", "Each contact resulted in infection, S \u2192 I, with probability proportional to the relative infectiousness of the infected individual on that day, scaled to obtain the specified value of R0.", "To conclude each time step, individuals\u2019 viral loads and test results counters were advanced, with those whose infectious period had completely passed moved to recovery, I, Q \u2192 R.\n\n#### Calibration to achieve targeted R0and estimation of R\n\nAs a consistency check, each simulation\u2019s R0 was estimated as follows to ensure that simulations were properly calibrated to their intended values.", "Note that to vary R0, the proportionality constant in the function that maps viral load to infectiousness need only be adjusted up or down.", "In a typical Susceptible Exposed Infected Recovered (SEIR) model, this would correspond to changing the infectiousness parameter, which governs the rate at which I-to-S contacts cause new infections \u03b2.", "For the fully mixed, the value of R0 was numerically estimated by running single-generation simulations in which 50 infected individuals were placed in a population of N \u2212 50 others.", "The number of secondary infections from those initially infected was recorded and used to directly estimate R0.", "For the agent-based model, the value of R0 depends on the distribution of infected agents due to stratification by age and household.", "We numerically estimate R0 by averaging over the number of secondary infections caused by each agent who was infected in the first 15 days of the simulation (at which point, the population is still more than 99.99% susceptible).", "Estimations of R proceeded exactly as estimations of R0 for both models, except with interventions applied to the viral loads and, therefore, the dynamics.", "Prediction of R without direct simulation is described in text S1.", "## Supplementary Material\n\nhttp://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sciadv.abd5393/DC1:\n\nClick here to view.", "Adobe PDF - abd5393_SM.pdf:\n\nClick here to view.(1.0M, pdf)\n\nTest sensitivity is secondary to frequency and turnaround time for COVID-19 screening:\n\nClick here to view.", "## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank the BioFrontiers Institute IT HPC group.", "This work was supported by grants NIH F32 AI145112 (J.M.B.), NIH F30 AG063468 (E.L.), MURI W911NF1810208 (B.W. and M.T.), an NIH directors DP5 award 1DP5OD028145-01 (M.J.M.), and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (R.P.).", "Author contributions: D.B.L., M.J.M., and R.P. conceived and designed the study.", "D.B.L., E.L., S.S., J.M.B., J.A.H., M.J.M., and R.P. developed the viral load model.", "D.B.L., B.W., and M.T. developed the epidemiological models.", "D.B.L. and B.W. conducted the simulations.", "D.B.L., M.J.M., and R.P. analyzed the data.", "All authors wrote and edited the manuscript.", "Competing interests: D.B.L. is a member of the scientific advisory board of Darwin Biosciences.", "The authors declare that they have no other competing interests.", "Data and materials availability: All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper and/or the Supplementary Materials.", "Open-source code is available at https://github.com/LarremoreLab/covid_testing.", "Additional data related to this paper may be requested from the authors.", "## SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS\n\nSupplementary material for this article is available at http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sciadv.abd5393/DC1\n\n##\n\nView/request a protocol for this paper from Bio-protocol."]
