epidemiological association (direct or indirect) with other COVID-19 patients.", "Interestingly, a growing number of individuals with no travel history to China and no direct contact with infected patients have become infected (Lim et al., 2020).", "To understand how this virus rapidly spreads within a community, and to inform infection control messaging, it is essential to develop an experimental animal model that can support the active infection, shedding, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to sentinel animals.", "In this study, we established an infection and transmission ferret animal model for COVID-19.", "The SARS-CoV-2 was found to efficiently infect ferrets and induce moderate increases in body temperature (\u223c38.5-40.3\u00b0C).", "Moreover, we were able to detect viral RNA in blood (for 4 dpi), nasal washes (for 8 dpi), urine (for 8 dpi), and fecal (for 8 dpi) specimens.", "Findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can be shed through multiple routes of body discharge specimens, with these potentially serving as sources for viral transmission to those in close contact with infected individuals.", "Interestingly, ferrets in direct contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection as early as 2 dpc, suggesting that rapid transmission occurred even prior to infected ferrets reaching their highest viral RNA copy numbers in nasal washes at 4 dpi.", "Transmission also occurred prior to peak body temperature and body weight loss in infected animals, which is consistent with the infectiousness of individuals during asymptomatic periods.", "With regard to potential airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, viral RNA was detected in nasal washes and fecal specimens in IC ferrets and persisted for 4 days after indirect contact; only one of the two positive animals seroconverted.", "These data show that airborne transmission is likely but is considerably less robust than direct contact transmission.", "Following the fortuitous discovery of the natural susceptibility of ferrets to human influenza viruses, ferret models were found to highly reproduce the human disease manifestation of several respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenzaviruses, and SARS-CoV-1 (Capraro et al., 2008, Chan et al., 2018, Enkirch and von Messling, 2015, Park et al., 2018).", "In addition to the presence of the respective viral receptors, the anatomic proportions of the ferret upper and lower respiratory tracts, the density of submucosal glands in the bronchial wall, and the number of generations of terminal bronchioles all reproduce the condition in the human respiratory tract (Enkirch and von Messling, 2015).", "This further supports the significance of ferrets as animal model for human respiratory viral infection.", "We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets showed high virus titers in upper respiratory tracts (nasal washes) and consequently transmitted to naive ferrets by direct contact at high efficiency, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 ferret model recapitulates aspects of human infection and transmission.", "Further, as suspected in recent COVID-19 patients (Kim et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2020), we detected the infectious viruses in urine and fecal specimens of virus-infected ferrets.", "However, there are also limitations in the SARS-CoV-2 ferret model, as SARS-CoV-2 infected ferrets showed only mild clinical symptoms and relatively lower virus titers in lungs of infected animals than SARS-CoV-1-infected or MERS-CoV-infected hACE2 or hDPP4 transgenic mice (Glass et al., 2004 and Li et al., 2017).", "On the other hand, it is also possible that SARS-CoV-2 replicates weaker but persists longer in vivo than SARS-CoV-1, ultimately leading an asymptomatic carrier with a persistent infection to effectively spread the virus.", "Therefore, given the rapid spreading characteristics of SASRS-CoV-2 in humans, ferret model would be a useful tool to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic anti-virals and preventive vaccines.", "## STAR\u2605Methods\n\n### Key Resources Table\n\nREAGENT or RESOURCE| SOURCE| IDENTIFIER   ---|---|---   Antibodies      * * *      In-house

Propagated viruses were stored at \u221280\u00b0C freezer for future usage.", "### Method Details\n\n#### Study Design for Animal-to-Animal Transmission\n\n12 \u221224 month old male and female ferrets, which were confirmed as Influenza A (H1N1, H3N1), MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV antibody free ferrets by the standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) previously described elsewhere (El- Duah et al., 2019, Park et al., 2014, Woo et al., 2005), were infected through intranasal (IN) route with NMC2019-nCoV02 virus, an isolate of SARS-CoV-2 from a COVID-19 confirmed patient in Korea, 2020 February, at a dose of 105.5 TCID50 per ferrets (n = 2).", "At one-day post-infection, one naive direct contact (DC) and indirect contact (IC) ferrets were introduced into the cage, while IC ferrets were separated from inoculated animals with a partition, which allowed air to move, and without direct contact between animals.", "This study was conducted with three independent trials.", "Blood, fecal, nasal wash, saliva, and urine specimens were collected every other day for 12 days from each group of ferrets to detect SARS-CoV-2.", "Further, to investigate whether each collected specimen contained infectious live virus, we inoculated it onto Vero cells.", "To access the replication of the virus in ferrets following SARS-CoV-2 infection in various organs, additional 9 ferrets were infected with SARS- CoV-2 by IN route.", "Three ferrets were sacrificed at 4, 8 and 12 dpi were and their lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and intestinal tissues were collected with individual scissors to avoid cross contamination.", "#### Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to Detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA\n\nCollected ferret secretions were resuspended with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing antibiotics (5% penicillin/streptomycin; GIBCO).", "For virus titration, total RNA was extracted from the collected samples using the RNeasy Mini\u00ae kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.", "A cDNA synthesis kit (Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase; QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used to synthesize single strand cDNA using total viral RNA.", "To quantify viral RNA and viral copy number, quantitative real-time RT- PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed for the partial Spike gene (Table 1) and ORF1a (Table S1) with the SYBR Green kit (iQ\u2122 SYBR Green supermix kit, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and the number of viral RNA copies was calculated and compared to the number of copies of the standard control.", "#### Immunohistochemistry (IHC)\n\nTissue samples were collected from PBS control and NMC-nCoV02 infected ferrets and incubated in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for fixation before they were embedded in paraffin based to standard procedures.", "The embedded tissues were sectioned and dried for 3 days at room temperature.", "To detect the viral antigen by immunohistochemistry, mouse polyclonal antibody developed by inactivated NMC-nCoV02 was used as the primary antibody.", "Antigen was visualized using the biotin-avidin system (Vector Labs).", "Slides were viewed using the Olympus IX 71 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) microscope with DP controller software to capture images.", "### Quantification and Statistical Analysis\n\n#### Statistical Analysis\n\nThe statistical significance of infected and contact samples compared with naive sample was assessed by two-way ANOVA with Sidaks multiple comparisons test and one way ANOVA Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test.", "While for the comparison of the significance of viral copy number or titer among samples, we use the two-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test.", "Data plotting, interpolation and statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.2 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).", "Statistical details of experiments are described in the figure legends.", "A p value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.", "## Acknowledgement\n\nAll animal experiments were approved by the Medical Research Institute, a member of the Laboratory Animal Research Center of Chungbuk National University (LARC) (approval number CBNUA-1352-20-02), and were conducted in strict accordance and adherence to relevant policies regarding animal handling as mandated under the Guidelines for Animal Use and Care of the Korea Center for Disease Control (K-CDC).", "Viruses were handled in an enhanced biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment laboratory as approved by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC-14-3-07).", "This work was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2018M3A9H4056536, 2020R1A2C 3008339), the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB) Research Initiative Program (KGM9942011), the National Institute of Health (AI140705, AI140718, AI152190, and AI116585), and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance [CEIRS] contract number HHSN272201400006C).", "### Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization: Y.I.
