["## Abstract\n\n### Objective\n\nThe aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that youths with obesity, when removed from structured school activities and confined to their homes during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, will display unfavorable trends in lifestyle behaviors.", "### Methods\n\nThe sample included 41 children and adolescents with obesity participating in a longitudinal observational study located in Verona, Italy.", "Lifestyle information including diet, activity, and sleep behaviors was collected at baseline and 3 weeks into the national lockdown during which home confinement was mandatory.", "Changes in outcomes over the two study time points were evaluated for significance using paired t tests.", "### Results\n\nThere were no changes in reported vegetable intake; fruit intake increased (P = 0.055) during the lockdown.", "By contrast, potato chip, red meat, and sugary drink intakes increased significantly during the lockdown (P value range, 0.005 to < 0.001).", "Time spent in sports activities decreased by 2.30 (SD 4.60) h/wk (P = 0.003), and sleep time increased by 0.65 (SD 1.29) h/d (P = 0.003).", "Screen time increased by 4.85 (SD 2.40) h/d (P < 0.001).", "### Conclusions\n\nRecognizing these adverse collateral effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic lockdown is critical in avoiding depreciation of weight control efforts among youths afflicted with excess adiposity.", "Depending on duration, these untoward lockdown effects may have a lasting impact on a child\u2019s or adolescent\u2019s adult adiposity level.", "##\n\n### Study Importance\n\n### What is already known?\n\n  * \u25ba\n\nChildren and adolescents gain more weight during summer vacations than during the structured school year, leading to the hypothesis that the coronavirus disease 2019 lockdown will lead to unfavorable changes in lifestyle behaviors among homebound youths with obesity.", "### What does this study add?\n\n  * \u25ba\n\nFindings from this longitudinal observational study, conducted in Italy, support the hypothesis that unfavorable changes in eating, sleep, and activity behaviors occur in children and adolescents with obesity during a nonschool lockdown period.", "### How might these results change the focus of clinical practice?\n\n  * \u25ba\n\nRecognizing these adverse collateral effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic lockdown is critical in avoiding depreciation of hard\u2010fought weight\u2010control efforts among youths afflicted with excess adiposity.", "## Introduction\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) pandemic has had far\u2010reaching health, social, and economic implications.", "Among them is the abrupt cessation of school programs for children and adolescents in Italy who by mandate had to remain in their homes during the \u201clockdown\u201d aimed at containing and mitigating spread of COVID\u201019.", "There are reasons to be concerned about housebound children and adolescents who have overweight and obesity; previous studies have supported the hypothesis that these youths will fare worse on weight\u2010control lifestyle programs while at home compared with when they are engaged in their usual school curriculum (1).", "In support of this hypothesis, a 2007 study by von Hippel et al.

(1) to recently advance the argument that the COVID\u201019 pandemic, by restricting children from attending school, will exacerbate the risk factors for \u201cweight gain associated with summer recess.", "\u201d The authors additionally postulated that homes will be stocked during the lockdown with ultraprocessed and calorie\u2010dense foods, a suggestion now strongly supported by recent observations in real\u2010world settings (6).", "The aim of this longitudinal clinical study was to test the hypothesis that factors contributing to weight gain among children and adolescents with overweight and obesity are exacerbated during a pandemic\u2010associated lockdown.", "## Methods\n\n### Study design and rationale\n\nNonadult participants with obesity (BMI \u2265 25) were enrolled as controls in the ongoing longitudinal observational Obesita lavoro Perilux Study in Verona, Italy, where lifestyle changes are the main therapeutic goal, and the protocol includes periodic telephone interviews.", "The study was approved by the hospital Institutional Review Board (Protocol: 5384, 01/29/2019), and parents provided informed consent at the first/baseline evaluation visit, which occurred between May 13 and July 30, 2019.", "During this period, children attended school (May to June) or were involved in structured postschool activities (July) administered weekdays during the morning.", "Body weight, height, and waist circumference were measured at the baseline visit;
