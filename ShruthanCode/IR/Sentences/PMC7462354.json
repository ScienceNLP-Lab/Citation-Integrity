["## Abstract\n\n### Objectives\n\nThere is preliminary evidence of racial and social economic disparities in the population infected by and dying from COVID-19.", "The goal of this study is to report the associations of COVID-19 with respect to race, health, and economic inequality in the United States.", "### Methods\n\nWe performed an ecological study of the associations between infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 and demographic, socioeconomic, and mobility variables from 369 counties (total population, 102,178,117 [median, 73,447; IQR, 30,761\u2013256,098]) from the seven most affected states (Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts).", "### Results\n\nThe risk factors for infection and mortality are different.", "Our analysis shows that counties with more diverse demographics, higher population, education, income levels, and lower disability rates were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection.", "However, counties with higher proportion with disability and poverty rates had a higher death rate.", "African Americans were more vulnerable to COVID-19 than other ethnic groups (1981 African American infected cases versus 658 Whites per million).", "Data on mobility changes corroborate the impact of social distancing.", "### Conclusion\n\nOur study provides evidence of racial, economic, and health inequality in the population infected by and dying from COVID-19.", "These observations might be due to the workforce of essential services, poverty, and access to care.", "Counties in more urban areas are probably better equipped at providing care.", "The lower rate of infection, but a higher death rate in counties with higher poverty and disability could be due to lower levels of mobility, but a higher rate of comorbidities and health care access.", "### Electronic supplementary material\n\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s40615-020-00833-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to

Ecological-based study\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe complexity of managing patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a global pandemic [1] originated in China [2], has led to the widespread implementation of preventative measures such as social distancing and mask use [3] in many countries including the United States (US).", "As of April 14, 2020, there were over 1.9 million confirmed cases around the world with 601,000 cases and 24,129 deaths in the US alone [4].", "It has been reported that age 65 and older, body mass index \u2265 40, diabetes [5] immunosuppression, smoking, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases are underlying conditions that increase the risk of death from COVID-19 [6, 7].", "The most recent conundrum of this disease is ascribed to the preliminary evidence of racial disparities in the population infected and dying from COVID-19 [3].", "In a recent study, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported data from fourteen states and suggested that the US Black population may be disproportionally affected by COVID-19 [3].", "This observation is consistent with the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic where other studies showed evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in the population affected both in exposure, severity, and mortality of the disease [8, 9].", "As states release the racial and ethnic demographic data of COVID-19 cases, in addition to the increased spread of this disease to the central states, it is imperative that we understand the patterns of infection and death to reduce the risks, especially for high-risk population, and resolve issues that impede the provision of optimal care.", "In this study, we conducted an ecological-based analysis to explore racial and economic inequality associated with the infection rate and risk of mortality due to COVID-19 in the US.", "The goal of the study was to provide evidence on the association of COVID-19 with respect to race, income level, poverty, education, and the impact of preventative measures such as social distancing.", "We trust that the decision making by the states\u2019 officials will be driven by data and based on their unique needs and population characteristics to help in combating this disease.", "## Methodology\n\nThe study was conducted at two levels: (1) analysis of population characteristics (44 variables) for 369 counties in seven states which had the highest rate of COVID-19 infection as of April 9, 2020, along with COVID-19 infection and mortality rates.", "The included states were California, Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts; (2) analysis of COVID-19-related infection and death rate across all the states in the US with race/ethnicity information on the affected subject when available.", "### Data Source, Outcomes, and Independent Variables:\n\nData sources in this study include (1) publicly available data from USAfacts and the US Census Bureau for COVID-19 cases and county-level demographic data [10, 11], (2) COVID-19 data reported by each state on their department of health websites [10], (3) State Population by race/ethnicity data [12, 13], and (4) mobility data extracted from Google [14].", "The variables used in this study include county-level information on total population, mobility, race, poverty level, median income, education, disability, and rate of the insured population.", "Mobility data were extracted from Google as reported on April 05, 2020.", "The state-level data were extracted on April 16, 2020.", "The outcome variables include the rate of COVID-19 infection and all COVID-19-related death as provided by each state\u2019s department of health as of April 09, 2020.", "The infection rate is based on the reported results from all the laboratories testing samples in each county/state.", "The mortality data are reported by hospitals, nursing homes, and other health facilities.", "Table 1 summarizes the data elements used in this study.", "Only data provided by the states on their official websites were included in this study.", "Additionally, to compare the rate of COVID-19 cases and death, the population data for each ethnic/racial group affected were extracted from health department websites.", "### Table 1\n\nData elements, descriptions, reference to sources of data, and base statistics used in this study\n\nData

1\n\n**Denotes statistically significant\n\n### COVID-19 Infection and Mortality Are Higher Among African Americans\n\nWe have also extracted data on all the states with respect to race distribution (see Table S8).", "As of April 16, 2020, we have observed that African Americans, as defined in the reports, have a higher rate of COVID-19 infection and a higher death rate.", "The number of African Americans infected by COVID-19 is 64,605 (1981 cases per million) with the number of deaths reaching 6181 (211 deaths per million), while the number of Whites, as defined in the reports, is 104,914 (658 cases per million) infected and 9806 (76 deaths per million) dead leading to a disproportional percentage of African Americans infected (p < 0.0001) by COVID-19 and dead (p < 0.0001) as the result.", "The number of infected Latinos and Asians per million, as defined in the reports, is 947 and 390, while the rate of mortality (per million) is 82 and 52 respectively.", "## Discussion\n\nOur analysis highlights that counties with a higher total population, more diverse demographics, higher education, and income level are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection; however, counties with a smaller population, higher disability rates, and higher poverty levels have a higher rate of mortality.", "The conflicting results for counties\u2019 population could be related to the population density, easier access to the high quality of healthcare, and more experience managing the COVID-19 infection due to the higher number of patients.", "One can argue that counties with fewer residents have a higher rural population.", "Studies have shown that there are significant differences in the overall healthcare assessment of rural populations as compared with urban populations [18].", "Our observation is also aligned with a recent analysis of health differences in 3053 US counties, showing that rural areas are more likely to have poorer health outcomes [19].", "The association of poverty and disability makes the conclusion of this study more complex and beyond the analysis of social determinants.", "By adding the interaction terms in the linear regression model (death rate~poverty + disability + poverty:disability) of death rate, we do not observe a significant interaction (p = 0.469), suggesting these two variables could be independent in their contribution to the risk of mortality.", "Populations with a higher disability [20] and lower median income [21] might be less mobile, have more comorbidities [22, 23], and also less likely benefit from timely high-quality care [24] and high-quality nutrition; all of these factors could be equally important to combating this pandemic [25, 26].", "Furthermore, our analysis of the preliminary data on mobility, given the recent social distancing guidelines, corroborate the impact of this intervention on lowering the infection rate and death.", "Our findings highlight that race (especially Black) is a risk factor for the infection.", "To further our understanding of the impact of race, we performed an additional comparative analysis using ANOVA and found that counties with fewer than median non-Hispanic Whites (group 1: percentage of non-Hispanic Whites \u2264 39.7%) had a significantly lower total population (p < 5.2E-15) than counties with more than median non-Hispanic Whites (group 2: percentage of non-Hispanic Whites > 39.7%); however, the rate of mortality is significantly higher (p < 0.003) while the rate of infection is significantly lower(p < 4.4E-13) in this group; Table S9 includes additional details.", "Finally, access to insurance was a protective factor in terms of mortality from COVID-19, but access to insurance did not significantly associate with the rate of infection.", "Comparison of counties with higher or lower than median death rates provided further evidence of the association of lower median income and higher poverty levels across all the races with mortality.", "The counties with a higher death rate also had a higher percentage of people on Medicaid.", "The latter is expected since Medicaid is significantly associated with the rate of poverty (Pearson correlation, 0.769, p < 0.005) as well as the rate of disability (Pearson correlation, 0.428, p < 0.005).", "Descriptive statistics of data from all the states also corroborates that African Americans might be disproportionally affected by this pandemic as of April 16, 2020.", "This observation is consistent with the H1N1 pandemic, where studies have shown evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in the population affected in terms of exposure, severity, and mortality of the disease [8, 9].", "Finally, historical data have taught us that minorities and people of color tend to be more affected by different diseases [27\u201330].", "This is the first systematic study on the racial, health, and economic disparity, as well as education, mobility, and COVID-19 infection in the US with the available data from the most severely impacted states.", "Our study had several limitations; the data was not granular, and we had missingness, especially for smaller and less populated counties.", "Access to the infected patient information and mortality data was not possible, and only aggregated data were used.", "Furthermore, many states claimed difficulties in reporting racial/ethnic demographic data due to patients opting out of providing their racial identification.", "The lack of clarity resulted in partially reported data for the death and case rate per million reported in this article, due to some states reporting on racial data for one, two, or all the racial variables specified in this study.", "The infection rate estimate may be underrepresented, as some individuals may have mild symptoms but lacked clinical validation of the infection.", "Finally, our in-depth analysis was based on only seven states, leading to conclusions that may not be generalizable to other regions.", "## Conclusion\n\nImplications of the results from this study highlight the value of the targeted interventions, as different counties, even within the same state, may have different characteristics and different needs.", "Furthermore, as the association between COVID-19-related fatality and infection is different among different race and health status, it is important to further study the impact of the immune system and immune-boosting strategies in the at-risk population (such as people with certain disabilities or those residing in elderly community centers), as preventive measure along with other measures based on social distancing guidelines and the ability to work from home.", "## Electronic Supplementary Material\n\nESM 1(1.0M, pdf)\n\nFigure
