factors also grew (14,15).", "PMC8561831_1": "In addition, vulnerable groups include elderly individuals, those with active malignancy and cardiopulmonary diseases, and immunocompromised individuals.3 4 While gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations of COVID-19 are also common, they are not associated with increased intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or mortality.5 Furthermore, a recent study found that while GI symptoms are common in patients with IBD with COVID-19, they are not associated with an increased risk of death due to COVID-19.6\n\n\n", "PMC8371510_3": "When grouped in meta-analyses, these immunomodulators were also associated with an increased risk of infection, hospitalization, and mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection[57-59].", "PMC7818789_1": "These risks continue to be explored in registries such as Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion (SECURE) and other population-based studies.24 \n\n\n", "PMC8570425_4": "Based on the SECURE-IBD data, the most significant risk factors for negative outcomes of COVID-19 were identified as age, active disease (defined by physician global assessment), and prednisone use (14,15).", "PMC8471264_1": "Of note, a few preclinical studies reported that thiopurines, a type of immunosuppressant, may lead to reduced viral replication [92,93] via other mechanisms, although clinical studies suggested possible harmful effects [94,95].", "PMC8570425_5": "The epidemiologic update included weekly presentations using data from Johns Hopkins University to illustrate the global epidemiology of COVID-19 (20), data from Public Health Agency of Canada that illustrated the details (including health outcomes) of confirmed Canadian cases of COVID-19 (9), and an update from the SECURE-IBD registry that illustrated IBD-specific cases of COVID-19 (14,15,18).", "PMC8371510_2": "For example, 5-aminosalicylate and its prodrug form sulfasalazine have increased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and increased the risk

corticosteroid exposure and consider corticosteroid-sparing therapies where appropriate[57,62].", "PMC8433611_3": "In patients with stable disease, a de-escalation of combination therapy with thiopurine and anti-TNF should be considered[62].", "PMC8433611_1": "In the most recent analysis of the SECURE-IBD registry collecting 1439 cases and specifically analyzing the effect of IBD medications on COVID-19 course, thiopurine therapy, both alone and in combination with anti-TNF, has emerged as an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 (aOR of 4.08 and 4.01, respectively) when compared with TNF\u03b1 antagonist monotherapy[62].", "PMC8464949_1": "Over time, data became available from published case series [2], observational studies [3], international registries [4,5,6] and

"PMC8433611_4": "Treatment with non-immunosuppressive medications (5-aminosalicylates) should be continued irrespectively of viral symptoms[74,78] , despite data from the SECURE-IBD registry
