T3	ACCURATE 31831 32328	To determine for the first time the clinical-pathological characteristics of human claudin-low breast tumors, we evaluated our breast cancer patient database (UNC337) and two independent gene expression data sets (NKI295 and MDACC133) [11-13] using the nine-cell line claudin-low predictor and the previously published PAM50 subtype predictor (Figure 3a) because these two objective centroid predictors have been demonstrated to be the most robust to classify breast tumors into discrete subtypes.
