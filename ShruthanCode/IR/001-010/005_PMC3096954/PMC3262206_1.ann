T1	Context 0 174	Recent advances in the field suggest that breast tumors belonging to the claudin-low and basal-like intrinsic subtypes are particularly enriched in TIC cell signatures [6,7].
T2	ACCURATE 4171 4714	More recently, a tumor initiating cell (TIC) genomic signature derived from CD44+/CD24-/low-sorted cells and mammospheres obtained from primary human breast tumors was found to be exclusively enriched by gene expression in the claudin-low subtype [6,7], and the expression of this CD44+/CD24-/low/claudin-low profile increased in posttreatment samples after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormone therapy [7]. Overall, these studies suggest that the claudin-low tumor subtype lacks common epithelial cell features and is enriched for TIC features
T3	ACCURATE 49720 50077	Thus, our data suggest that claudin-low tumors, compared with the other intrinsic breast tumor subtypes, are the most enriched for stem cell and/or TIC features, and on the basis of our vimentin immunofluorescence staining, it appears that these mesenchymal features are present within epithelial cells, which is a feature not seen in normal breast tissues.
