T1	MultiCitation 795 796	7
T4	ACCURATE 21062 21375	These findings, together with the low expression of epithelial cell-cell adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin, are consistent with an EMT (changes in cell phenotype between epithelial and mesenchymal states) [31] in claudin-low tumors and a potential recruitment of multiple types of leukocytes into these tumors
T5	ACCURATE 24768 25232	These nine cell lines (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, Hs578T, BT549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM1315MO2, SUM159PT and HBL100) showed a gene expression pattern similar to the claudin-low tumor subtype with the lowest expression of genes involved in epithelial cell-cell adhesion (i.e., E-cadherin and claudins 3, 4 and 7), luminal differentiation (i.e., CD24, EpCAM) and high values for the CD44/CD24 and CD49f/EpCAM mRNA ratios (Figure S4, Table S3 in Additional file 1).

T2	Context 643 798	Claudin-low tumors express mesenchymal genes such as Twist1, Twist2, Zeb1, Zeb2, Slug and Snail and low levels of E-cadherin and claudins 3, 4 and 7 [6,7].
T3	ACCURATE 18189 18441	Box-and-whisker plot for expression of the luminal and proliferation gene signatures. (b) Markers of EMT (vimentin [VIM], Snail-1 [SNAI1], Snail-2 [SNAI2], TWIST1, TWIST2, ZEB1, ZEB2, E-cadherin [CDH1], and claudins 3 [CLDN3], 4 [CLDN4] and 7 [CLDN7]).

T6	ACCURATE 48894 49200	Consistent with this finding, we observed a high mRNA expression of known transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin such as SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST1, TWIST2, ZEB1 and ZEB2, and other EMT-inducing factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1a in claudin-low tumors [31] (Figure 1b, Figure S2 in Additional file 1).
