T4	Citation 156 160	[20]
T1	Context 0 161	Claudin-low carcinomas and representative cell lines are characterized by a down-regulation of epithelial junction proteins, such as cadherins and claudins [20].
T2	ACCURATE 3728 3973	These distinct tumors were found in both human and murine breast tumor data sets and were characterized by the low gene expression of tight junction proteins claudin 3, 4 and 7 and E-cadherin, a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein.
T3	ACCURATE 21384 21698	These findings, together with the low expression of epithelial cell-cell adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin, are consistent with an EMT (changes in cell phenotype between epithelial and mesenchymal states) [31] in claudin-low tumors and a potential recruitment of multiple types of leukocytes into these tumors.
T5	ACCURATE 25090 25554	These nine cell lines (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, Hs578T, BT549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM1315MO2, SUM159PT and HBL100) showed a gene expression pattern similar to the claudin-low tumor subtype with the lowest expression of genes involved in epithelial cell-cell adhesion (i.e., E-cadherin and claudins 3, 4 and 7), luminal differentiation (i.e., CD24, EpCAM) and high values for the CD44/CD24 and CD49f/EpCAM mRNA ratios (Figure S4, Table S3 in Additional file 1).
