T3	Citation 766 770	[19]
T1	Context 580 770	monocytes express SAMHD1 as an interferon-inducible factor (Figure 2E) that is degraded upon Vpx-supported HIV-1 infection confirming the results in dendritic cells [20] and macrophages [19]
T2	ACCURATE 2260 2560	Thus, our findings reveal that macrophages are defended from HIV-1 infection by a mechanism that prevents an unwanted interferon response triggered by self nucleic acids, and uncover an intricate relationship between innate immune mechanisms that control response to self and to retroviral pathogens.
T4	ACCURATE 11962 12285	Significantly, Vpx induced an almost complete degradation of SAMHD1 in cells treated with the control siRNAs. By contrast, in the DCAF1 depleted cells degradation of SAMHD1 induced by Vpx was significantly inhibited providing further evidence for our hypothesis that Vpx utilizes CRL4DCAF1 E3 to program SAMHD1 degradation.
