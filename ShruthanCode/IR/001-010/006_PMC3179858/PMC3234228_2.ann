T3	CONTRADICT 2345 2644	Thus, our findings reveal that macrophages are defended from HIV-1 infection by a mechanism that prevents an unwanted interferon response triggered by self nucleic acids, and uncover an intricate relationship between innate immune mechanisms that control response to self and to retroviral pathogens

#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	could be NSUB or CONTRADICT. The reference article does not further mention interferons. While “mechanism that prevents an unwanted interferon response triggered by self nucleic acids” seemingly refers to SAMHD1 (making it CONTRADICT), It is not made clear by this sentence whether SAMHD1 prevents an interferon response or is triggered by it.
