T2	Context 2316 2431	Two recent studies identified SAMHD1 as a cellular factor that is specifically bound and degraded by Vpx [59] [60].
T3	ACCURATE 11898 12020;12022 12193	We conclude that Vpx specifically binds to, and recruits SAMHD1 to the DCAF1-DDB1 module of CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Because SAMHD1 was originally identified in HEK 293T cells, it was important to confirm that it is both expressed and targeted by Vpx for degradation via CRL4DCAF1 in MDM.
