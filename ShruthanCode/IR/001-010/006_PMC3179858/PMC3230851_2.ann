#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	SAMHD1 as a sensor is not explored in the reference article. Unclear whether the claim that SAMHD1 "may be responsible for innate sensing of viral DNA" is intended to relate to the reference article or is pure unfounded speculation on the citing articles part. If the latter is true, it does not make sense that the citing paper would choose to include an in-text citation simply for naming SAMHD1.
