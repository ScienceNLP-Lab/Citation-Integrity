T2	ACCURATE 2757 2874	These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway can reduce Aβ42 levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice.
T3	ACCURATE 7690 7929	Thus, our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can lower Aβ levels and slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease, possibly by stimulating autophagy.
