#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	The citing article states that rapamycin treatment was reported as protective against behavioral decline. However, here in the citing article, the authors indicate that there was no SIGNIFICANCE in the relationship between rapamycin and (non cognitive) components of behavior.
T2	OVERSIMPLIFY 9918 10136	A trend to improved retention was observed in rapamycin-treated non-Tg mice, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. c and d, Rapamycin treatment does not affect non-cognitive components of behavior
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 2286 2479	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of AÎ²42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
