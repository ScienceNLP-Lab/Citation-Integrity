T1	Context 512 637	Data in apparent contradiction to each other have been also reported by others [5], [29], [32], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75].
T3	ACCURATE 5492 5815	While excessive autophagic activity can lead to cell death, increased autophagy has been shown to facilitate the clearance of aggregation- prone proteins such as Aβ[20], [21], [22], pathological prion protein[23], [24], and α-synuclein[25], and to promote neuronal survival in a variety of neurodegenerative disease models.
T4	ACCURATE 7581 7820	Thus, our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can lower Aβ levels and slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease, possibly by stimulating autophagy.
T5	ACCURATE 18104 18165	The role of autophagy in AD, however, is not clear[19], [27].
