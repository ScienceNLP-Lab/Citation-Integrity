T1	Context 749 839	Autophagy has been shown to protect neurons from Aβ induced cytotoxicity [44], [45], [46].
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	The citing article argues that autophagy is a way to protect neurons from Aβ induced cytotoxicity. here, the reference article says autophagy is involved in clearance of aggregative proteins, which are involved in cytotoxicity development. These two points are cohesive, and this article was referenced correctly.
T2	OVERSIMPLIFY 17011 17146	Autophagy is a key pathway for the clearance of aggregation-prone proteins and may have a protective role in proteinopathies[20], [39].
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 4783 5106	While excessive autophagic activity can lead to cell death, increased autophagy has been shown to facilitate the clearance of aggregation- prone proteins such as Aβ[20], [21], [22], pathological prion protein[23], [24], and α-synuclein[25], and to promote neuronal survival in a variety of neurodegenerative disease models.
