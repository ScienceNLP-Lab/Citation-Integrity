T1	Context 503 657	rapamycin administration improved memory functions in murine models of AD (Caccamo et al., 2010[13]; Majumder et al., 2012[48]; Spilman et al., 2010[75]).
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	The citing article says that rapamycin administration improves memory function in mouse AD models. Here, the reference article directly agrees with this citation, indicating that rapamycin abrogates memory deficits.
T2	ACCURATE 7296 7356	Rapamycin abrogates memory deficits in PDAPP hAPP(J20) mice.
T3	ACCURATE 13710 14028	Rapamycin-fed transgenic PDAPP mice, however, showed improved learning ( Figure 1a ) and memory ( Figure 1b ), with improved performances on the last day of training and retention of the former location of the escape platform restored to levels indistinguishable from those of non-transgenic littermates ( Figure 1b ).
