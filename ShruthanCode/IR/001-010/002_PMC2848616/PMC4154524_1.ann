#1	AnnotatorNotes T1	The citing article says that rapamycin is beneficial on cellular function and in transgenic models of AD. Similarly, this reference article snippet has the same point, indicating that rapamycin is a positive intervention upon AD progression in transgenic models.
T2	Context 174 322	many studies have revealed that the stimulation of autophagy can reduce AÎ² accumulation and alleviate memory deficits in transgenic AD mice [45-48].
T1	ACCURATE 22301 22501	In summary, our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin[5], an intervention that extends lifespan in mice[5], [6], can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease
