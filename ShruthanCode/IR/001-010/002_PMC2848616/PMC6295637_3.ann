#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	The citation argues that rapamycin reduces cognitive deficits related to neurological disorders, and this sentence illustrates agreement with that. The remainder of this paper also indicates the same concept in agreement.
T3	ACCURATE 5686 5890	Here we show that long-term mTOR inhibition by rapamycin inhibited mTOR in brain, prevented AD-like cognitive deficits ( Fig. 1 ) and lowered levels of AÎ²42 ( Fig. 2 ) in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T4	ACCURATE 13429 13747	Rapamycin-fed transgenic PDAPP mice, however, showed improved learning ( Figure 1a ) and memory ( Figure 1b ), with improved performances on the last day of training and retention of the former location of the escape platform restored to levels indistinguishable from those of non-transgenic littermates ( Figure 1b ).
