T2	Context 631 770	Rapamycin induced inhibition of mTORC1 has also been shown to decrease beta-amyloid expression by increasing the rate of autophagy [18,29].
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	The citing article indicates that rapamycin induced inhibition of mTORC1 in the brain has been shown to decrease amyloid beta expression, which is reflected here in the reference article.
T3	ACCURATE 6383 6532	These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway by long-term rapamycin treatment can reduce Aβ42 levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice
T4	ACCURATE 2322 2632	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
