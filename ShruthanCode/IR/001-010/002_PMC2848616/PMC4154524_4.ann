T3	MultiCitation 139 141	45
T1	Context 94 146	Other authors show no modification of LC3-I [45,46].
#1	AnnotatorNotes T4	The citing article says that no modification of LC3-I is indicated. However, this sentence from the reference article discusses how there is a modification of LC3-II converting into LC3-I, which then degrades intraluminally. The degradation of anything seems as if it'd be "modification" of some sort, so the citing authors made a claim that is inaccurate. This is also the only sentence in the entire reference paper that discusses LC3-I at all, and there is no indication of "no modification" of it as the citing authors state.
T4	CONTRADICT 18052 18221	During autophagy, LC3-II on the cytosolic side of autophagosomal membranes is delipidated to LC3-I and is also degraded intraluminally by lysosomal hydrolases[43], [44].
