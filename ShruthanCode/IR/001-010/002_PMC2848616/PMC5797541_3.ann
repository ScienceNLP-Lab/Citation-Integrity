T1	Context 0 262	Rapamycin, a selective inhibitor of target-of-rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) and thus modulator of the mTOR pathway activity, improved learning and memory and reduced Aβ and tau pathology in the brains of AD mouse model (Caccamo et al., 2010; Spilman et al., 2010).
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	This sentence agrees exactly with the citing article's citation, which indicated that rapamycin a modulator of the mTOR pathway, improved cognitive ability and reduced AB pathology in the AD mouse model brain.
T3	ETIQUETTE 6038 6242	Here we show that long-term mTOR inhibition by rapamycin inhibited mTOR in brain, prevented AD-like cognitive deficits ( Fig. 1 ) and lowered levels of Aβ42 ( Fig. 2 ) in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T4	ETIQUETTE 5721 5914	A recent report showed that long-term treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway[5], or ablation of the mTOR target S6K1[6] extends lifespan in mice, possibly by delaying aging.
