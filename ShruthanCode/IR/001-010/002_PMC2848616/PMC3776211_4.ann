T1	Context 1185 1356	The strong effect of Rapamycin on these cellular functions also identifies mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effect of the drug in the transgenic model of AD [29].
T4	ACCURATE 2262 2455	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of AÎ²42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
