T1	Context 345 449	Decreased mTOR signaling leads to reduction in levels of Aβ (Spilman et al., 2010; Caccamo et al., 2014)
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	The citing article indicates that mTOR signaling protects AD mouse model memory from deterioration; here, the reference article says mTOR inhibition may have a positive effect on learning and memory specifically. Also, throughout the rest of the paper, it's emphasized how mTOR inhibition aids cognitive processes. 
#2	AnnotatorNotes T3	The citing article says that mTOR inhibition protects memory from deterioration; here, the reference paper says mTOR inhibition prevents cognitive deficits, which is directly related to memory. 
T2	ACCURATE 22523 22861	Although the differences in performance between control-fed and rapamycin-fed non- transgenic groups were not significant, they may suggest that changes in pathways different from autophagy (such as effects on the regulation of protein synthesis) as a result of long-term mTOR inhibition may have a positive effect on learning and memory.
T3	ACCURATE 6469 6673	Here we show that long-term mTOR inhibition by rapamycin inhibited mTOR in brain, prevented AD-like cognitive deficits ( Fig. 1 ) and lowered levels of Aβ42 ( Fig. 2 ) in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
