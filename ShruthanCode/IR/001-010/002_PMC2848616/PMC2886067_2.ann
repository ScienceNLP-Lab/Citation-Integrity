T2	Context 369 511	recent publications indicate that pharmacological stimulation of autophagy can be beneficial and reduce Aβ mediated toxicity [44], [45], [46].
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	The citing article says that pharmacological stimulation of autophagy can reduce Aβ mediated toxicity. This sentence from the reference article illustrates this, indicating that rapamycin intervention (which is pharmacological) can lower Aβ levels and slow AD progression via stimulation of autophagy.
T3	ETIQUETTE 7386 7624	Thus, our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can lower Aβ levels and slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease, possibly by stimulating autophagy
