T1	Context 242 398	Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin retards cognitive deficits and reduces the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau by autophagy enhancement in AD models.23,183
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	The citing article claims that mTOR inhibition by rapamycin retards cognitive deficits and aids autophagy enhancement in AD models. This sentence from the reference article is emphasizing the same point.
T2	ETIQUETTE 1953 2263	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
T3	ETIQUETTE 6281 6579	Activation of autophagy was prominent in transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice ( Fig. 3 ), suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function may be due in part to increased autophagy in neurons, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ in transgenic mice.
