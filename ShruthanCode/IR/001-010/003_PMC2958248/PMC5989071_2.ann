T5	ACCURATE 16105 16449	To identify which HIV nucleic acids trigger IFN-β expression, we transfected WT and Trex1−/− MEFs with synthetic 100 bp gag sequence oligonucleotides that correspond to HIV nucleic acids in the cytosol during reverse transcription (ssRNA to represent gRNA, RNA:DNA hybrid, ssDNA, dsDNA) and measured IFN-β mRNA 6 h later by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4a,b).
T6	ACCURATE 16450 16553	All DNA-containing oligonucleotides, but not ssRNA, induced more IFN-β in Trex1−/− compared to WT MEFs.
