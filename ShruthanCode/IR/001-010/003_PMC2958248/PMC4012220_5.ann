T4	Citation 1297 1313	Yan et al., 2010
T1	Context 1004 1315	The HIV-stimulated IFN response in Trex1-/- cells can be dampened by reverse transcriptase inhibitor (e.g., nevirapine) but not by integrase inhibitor (e.g., raltegravir), consistent with HIV DNA being the main pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) detected by an innate immune sensor (Yan et al., 2010).
A1	Level T1 Sentence
T3	ACCURATE 5593 5913	Nevirapine, which inhibits HIV reverse transcription, but not the IN inhibitor raltegravir, which acts after HIV DNA synthesis, inhibited IFN-β and IL-6 expression in response to HIV in Trex1−/− cells (Fig. 1e,f), suggesting that HIV reverse- transcribed DNA, rather than genomic RNA (gRNA), was triggering the response.
T5	ACCURATE 31387 31616	Therefore our working model of the innate immune pathway activated by cytosolic HIV DNA starts with an unknown sensor (that may preferentially recognize ssDNA) that signals through STING, TBK1 and IRF3 to activate IFN expression.
