T1	Context 214 296	meta-analyses for the ADGC Stage 1+2 cohort (11,840 LOAD vs. 10,931 controls) [28]
A1	Level T1 Sentence
T5	ACCURATE 3316 3446	For the Stage 2 replication, we used four additional datasets and additional samples from the ADCs (3,531 LOAD cases, 3,565 CNEs).
#2	AnnotatorNotes T5	The sums of the LOAD or CNE cases from stages 1+2 match what is stated in the citing context.
T6	ACCURATE 3616 3834	For Stages 1 and 2, we used both a meta- analysis (M) approach that integrates results from association analyses of individual datasets; and a joint analysis (J) approach where genotype data from each study are pooled.
T3	ACCURATE 2815 3315	To identify genetic variants associated with risk for AD, the ADGC assembled a discovery dataset [Stage 1; 8,309 LOAD cases, 7,366 cognitively normal controls (CNEs)] using data from eight cohorts and a ninth newly assembled cohort from the 29 NIA-funded Alzheimer Disease Centers (ADCs) (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, Supplementary Note) with data coordinated by the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) and samples coordinated by the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease (NCRAD).
