T1	Context 245 444	These studies have identified several new genes that show significant association after multiple test correction in multiple datasets: CLU, PICALM, BIN1, CR1, ABCA7, MS4A6A, CD33 and CD2AP [31]–[35].
T2	ACCURATE 17851 18283	Our observation of genome-wide significant associations at MS4A4A, CD2AP, EPHA1, and CD33 extend our understanding of the genetic architecture of LOAD and confirm the emerging consensus that common genetic variation plays a significant role in the etiology of LOAD. With our findings and those by Hollingsworth et al.12, there are now ten LOAD susceptibility loci (APOE, CR1, CLU, PICALM, BIN1, EPHA1, MS4A, CD33, CD2AP, and ABCA7).
