T1	Context 0 242	Unique ProbeIDs of differentially expressed in the ‘initial’ dataset from Voineagu et al. [20] (file = ‘nature10110-s3.xls’) were compared with the differential expression gene list in the present study comparing all autism and control cases.
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	Referencing the differentially expressed from this dataset. This reference article doesn't give "unique Probe IDs" but it couldn't anyway- that would breach confidentiality integrity, and the citing article references this regardless.
T2	ACCURATE 3423 3515	Heatmap of top 200 genes differentially expressed between autism and control cortex samples.
T3	ACCURATE 2791 3178	We identified 444 genes showing significant expression changes in autism cortex samples (DS1, Figure 1b), and only 2 genes differentially expressed (DE) between the autism and control groups in cerebellum (Methods), indicating that gene expression changes associated with autism were more pronounced in cerebral cortex, which became the focus of further analysis (Supplementary Table 2).
