T1	Context 234 420	The comparison of findings between the present study and Voineagu et al. [20] demonstrates a consistent overlap involving several pathways including repair- and immune-related processes.
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	The citing article says "repair related processes" which somewhat relates with plasticity, but there is not evidence "consistently" overlap (or at least announce it) in this reference article.
T2	OVERSIMPLIFY 21938 22153	Since immune molecules and cells such as microglia play a role in synaptic development and function26, we speculate that the observed immune up- regulation may be related to abnormal ongoing plasticity in ASD brain.
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 1291 1557	We further identify discrete modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism: a neuronal module enriched for known autism susceptibility genes, including the neuronal specific splicing factor A2BP1/FOX1, and a module enriched for immune genes and glial markers.
