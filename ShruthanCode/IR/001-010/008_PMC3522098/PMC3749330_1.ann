T1	Context 119 308	There is increasing evidence that skeletal muscles express myokines, hormone-like factors that are released into the serum to function in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner (1–5).
T3	ACCURATE 6862 7290	To investigate this, we treated cultured primary subcutaneous adipocytes with serum-free media conditioned by myocytes expressing PGC1α or cells expressing GFP. As shown in Fig 1e, the media from cells expressing ectopic PGC1α increased the mRNA levels of several brown fat-specific genes (Fig. 1e). This suggested that PGC1α causes the muscle cells to secrete molecule(s) that can induce a thermogenic gene program in the cells
