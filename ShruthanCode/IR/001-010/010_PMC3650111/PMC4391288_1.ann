T1	Context 238 445	In both humans and mice, TMAO concentrations correlate positively with CVD risk, and dietary supplementation with either TMAO or compounds that can be metabolized to TMAO increases atherosclerosis in mice12.
T2	ACCURATE 44352 44521	These observations are consistent with a proposed mechanism whereby oral carnitine ingestion contributes to atherosclerotic CVD risks via the microbiota metabolite TMAO.
T3	ACCURATE 1275 1449	Herein we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota metabolism of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis.
T4	ACCURATE 1997 2227	Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice significantly altered cecal microbial composition, markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA/TMAO, and increased atherosclerosis, but not following suppression of intestinal microbiota.
