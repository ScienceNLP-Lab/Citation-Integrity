T1	Context 2311 2581	Prevotella-dominated healthy omnivore individuals were recently reported to have increased basal levels of serum TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide), a product of inflammation linked to atherogenesis, compared to Bacteroides-dominated healthy individuals (Koeth et al., 2013).
T2	ACCURATE 18058 18408	When subjects were classified into previously reported enterotypes18 based upon fecal microbial composition, individuals with an enterotype characterized by enriched proportions of the genus Prevotella (n=4) demonstrated higher (p<0.05) plasma TMAO levels than subjects with an enterotype notable for enrichment of Bacteroides (n=49) genus (Fig. 2e).
T3	ACCURATE 3082 3264	Intestinal microbiota metabolism of choline/phosphatidylcholine produces trimethylamine (TMA), which is further metabolized to a proatherogenic species, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)
