T2	Context 23 154	FMO3 and TMAO have emerged as key components of a complex axis integrating diet and the gut microbiome with atherosclerosis12132136
T3	ETIQUETTE 4149 4335	These findings raise the possibility that other dietary nutrients possessing a trimethylamine structure may also generate TMAO from gut microbiota and promote accelerated atherosclerosis
T4	ETIQUETTE 5204 5456	Structure of carnitine and scheme of carnitine and choline metabolism to TMAO. L-Carnitine and choline (are both dietary trimethylamines that can be metabolized by microbiota to TMA. TMA is then further oxidized to TMAO by flavin monooxygenases (FMOs).
