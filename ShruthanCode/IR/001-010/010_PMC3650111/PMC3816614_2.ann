T2	Context 2588 2665	TMAO could be derived from increased consumption of meat (Koeth et al., 2013)
T3	ACCURATE 3266 3440	Herein we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota metabolism of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis.
T4	ACCURATE 3441 3606	Omnivorous subjects are shown to produce significantly more TMAO than vegans/vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism.
T5	ACCURATE 39018 39166	The present studies also suggest a novel mechanism for the observed relationship between dietary red meat ingestion and accelerated atherosclerosis.
T6	ACCURATE 44486 44758	Of note, we observed a significant increase in baseline plasma TMAO concentrations in what historically was called enterotype 2 (Prevotella) (P < 0.05), a relatively rare enterotype that previously in one study was associated with low animal fat and protein consumption18.
T7	ACCURATE 48441 48712	Our results suggest the safety of chronic L-carnitine supplementation should be examined, because high amounts of orally ingested carnitine may under some conditions prime our gut microbiota with enhanced capacity to produce TMAO, and potentially promote atherosclerosis.
