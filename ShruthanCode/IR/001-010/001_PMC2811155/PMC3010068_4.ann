T3	Citation 387 408	Narendra et al., 2010
T1	Context 159 410	In contrast to inhibition of transcription, inhibition of translation by treatment with cycloheximide (CHX) prevents both the CCCP-dependent induction of PINK1 expression and Parkin translocation to CCCP-uncoupled mitochondria (Narendra et al., 2010).
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	The citing article discusses how treatment with cycloheximide (CHX) prevents induction of PINK1 expression, such as is indicated here by the reference article (accumulation of...PINK1).
#2	AnnotatorNotes T4	The citing article mentions that Parkin translocation to uncoupled mitochondria is prevented by treatment with cycloheximide, which is similarly reflected here in the reference article. This snippet similarly illustrates how a treatment with cycloheximide blocks Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria. 
T2	ACCURATE 42652 42868	reatment of HeLa cells for 90 min with cycloheximide blocked the depolarization-induced accumulation of endogenous PINK1 in whole-cell lysates as well as in the mitochondria-rich membrane fraction (Figure 7A and 7B).
T4	ACCURATE 42869 43041	A 90-min treatment with cycloheximide, likewise, blocked Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria by confocal microscopy (96.0±3.5% vs. 11.3±4.2%) (Figure 7C and 7D).
