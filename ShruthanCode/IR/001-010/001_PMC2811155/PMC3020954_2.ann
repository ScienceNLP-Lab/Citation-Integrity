#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	The citing article refers to a similar concept as does this sentence from the reference article; however, the citing article is more definitive and conclusive than is its reference. The citing article says that Parkin promotes degradation of functionally impaired mitochondria through ubiquitination-dependent autophagy. The reference article only says "likely" by ubquitination in this sentence. Therefore, the citing article uses this reference too definitively, and makes a claim that is only suggested in this article, NOT one that is confirmed.
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 82754 82886	Accumulated PINK1 recruits Parkin to damaged mitochondria, which Parkin marks, likely by ubiquitination, for autophagic degradation.
