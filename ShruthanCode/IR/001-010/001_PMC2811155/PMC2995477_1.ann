#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	The ~63-kDa band (PINK1 FL) increases under treatment with valinomycin- and the citing article said that PINK1 accumulates under valinomycin treatment
#2	AnnotatorNotes T3	citing article discusses proteasome treatment... (the 2nd labeled accurate part of the highlighted paragraph finishes this thought and makes it comprehensive)
#3	AnnotatorNotes T4	Citing article says PINK Δ1 and Δ2 accumulate under proteasome inhibitor treatment (proteasome used here()
T2	ACCURATE 9568 9776	This ∼63-kDa band also increases in the mitochondria-rich membrane fraction following treatment with valinomycin, which, unlike CCCP, depolarizes mitochondria by permeabilizing the membrane to K+ (Figure S1A)
T3	ACCURATE 79913 80096	On healthy mitochondria PINK1 is constitutively imported, proteolytically cleaved into a cytosolic form, and degraded by the proteasome, resulting in low levels of mitochondrial PINK1
T4	ACCURATE 80098 80273	On damaged mitochondria with low membrane potentials (ΔΨ), however, PINK1 cleavage is blocked, leading to accumulation of mitochondrial PINK1 on the dysfunctional mitochondria

T1	Context 881 1091	endogenous PINK1 behaves similarly to the overexpressed PINK1 counterparts in that PINK1 FL accumulates under valinomycin treatment and PINK1 Δ1 and Δ2 accumulate under proteasome inhibitor treatment [9,12,22].
