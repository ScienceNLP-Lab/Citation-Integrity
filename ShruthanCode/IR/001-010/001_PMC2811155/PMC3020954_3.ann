T2	MultiCitation 2363 2367	[11]
T1	Context 2259 2468	Because PINK1 kinase activity is required for many Parkin functions and Parkin acts downstream of PINK1 [11], [14], [76], increased JNK signaling in Pink1−/− mice may in part be due to reduced Parkin activity.
A1	Level T1 Sentence
T3	ACCURATE 3340 3574	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps.
A2	Level T3 Sentence
T4	ACCURATE 7159 7371	Interestingly, overexpression of Parkin can partially compensate for PINK1 loss, but PINK1 overexpression cannot compensate for Parkin loss, suggesting that PINK1 functions upstream of Parkin in a common pathway.
A3	Level T4 Sentence
T5	ACCURATE 25193 25345	Together, these results show that PINK1 accumulation is upstream of Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria and independent of Parkin expression.
