T1	Context 954 1122	On the OMM, PINK1 recruits Parkin to mitochondria via its kinase activity (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010; Vives-Bauza et al., 2010).
#2	AnnotatorNotes T3	The citing article argues that PINK1 recruits Parkin to mitochondria via kinase activity. In agreement with this claim, the reference article here shows that when kinase activity is lacking, PINK1 fails to recruit Parkin to the mitochondria.
