T1	Context 0 237	The effect of the microbiome on atherosclerosis, glucose homeostasis and adiposity has been attributed, in part, to circulating metabolites such as trimethylamine-oxide and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut bacteria2345720.
T3	ACCURATE 1428 1601	Herein we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota metabolism of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis
T4	ACCURATE 3620 4158	Our microbiota has been linked to intestinal health, immune function, bioactivation of nutrients and vitamins, and more recently, complex disease phenotypes such as obesity and insulin resistance6-8. We recently reported a novel pathway in both humans and mice linking microbiota metabolism of dietary choline/phosphatidylcholine to CVD pathogenesis9. Choline, a trimethylamine and part of the head group of phosphatidylcholine, is metabolized by gut microbiota to produce an intermediate compound known as trimethylamine (TMA) (Fig. 1a).
