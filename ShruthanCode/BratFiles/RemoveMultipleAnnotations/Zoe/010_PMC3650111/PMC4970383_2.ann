T2	Context 1414 1568	In apoliprotein E-deficient mice fed a diet with  -carnitine, the promotion of atherosclerosis was also mediated by a microbiota-dependent mechanism (501)
T3	ACCURATE 26468 27190	We therefore next sought to investigate whether dietary L-carnitine had any impact on the extent of atherosclerosis in the presence vs. absence of TMAO formation in animal models. C57BL/6J, Apoe−/− mice were fed normal chow diet versus the same diet supplemented with L-carnitine from time of weaning. Aortic root atherosclerotic plaque quantification revealed approximately a doubling in disease burden compared to normal chow fed animals (Fig. 5a, b). Importantly, parallel studies in mice placed on oral antibiotic cocktail to suppress intestinal microbiota showed marked reductions in plasma TMA and TMAO levels (Fig. 5c), and complete inhibition in dietary L-carnitine-dependent increase in atherosclerosis (Fig. 5b).
