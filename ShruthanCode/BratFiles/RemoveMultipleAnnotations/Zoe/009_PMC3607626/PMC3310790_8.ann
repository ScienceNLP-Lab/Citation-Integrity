#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	The citation, indicating that this reference paper lacked use of young controls, is never confirmed by the reference authors. Perhaps it is true, but I cannot find confirmation of that. There is no indication of population group, age group, elderly population, young population... etc. There is also no indication of the reference authors saying what a future study could do better in the future- such as a more diverse sample size, so I am not certain iff the citation is 100% true and am not giving the benefit of the doubt.
