T1	Context 824 1209	Eight of these genes have some evidence in support of an association with autism (http://autismkb.cbi.pku.edu.cn/) [32], two of which (SYN1, PTS) met thresholds for a high level of evidence [32], and concordant changes in the differential expression in autism vs control were found for three of the genes (GPR56, HSPB1, BEX5) between this study and the work of others [13], [28], [33].
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	No mention of GPR56, HSPB1, or BEX5 in this article, and the citation indicates that this reference showed concordant changes in the differential expression between autism vs control in these 3 specific genes. I've thoroughly re-read the article to ensure this, and still cannot find anything. I don't think this paper should have been used as a citation.
