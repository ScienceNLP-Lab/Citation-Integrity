T1	Context 0 142	According to the most recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies, 63 individual SNPs have now been linked with diabetes risk [1].
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	63 SNPs are not associated with diabetes risk but rather in variance of disease susceptibility. Later in this article it says that only 18 genes are implicated in direct diabetes risk. 
#2	AnnotatorNotes T3	Earlier in this article it said SNPs are not associated with diabetes risk but rather in variance of disease susceptibility. Here in the reference article it says that only 18 genes are implicated in direct diabetes risk. 
T2	CONTRADICT 10173 10447	Assuming a T2D population prevalence of 8%, these 63 newly discovered and established autosomal loci together account for 5.7% of variance in disease susceptibility, as calculated by transforming dichotomous disease risk onto a continuous liability scale20 (Online Methods).
T3	CONTRADICT 52727 52845	and (v) 18 genes implicated in monogenic forms of diabetes38, not already overlapping other loci included in the list.
