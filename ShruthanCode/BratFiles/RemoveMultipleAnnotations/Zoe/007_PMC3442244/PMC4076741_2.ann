T3	ACCURATE 16615 16985	We detected two loci at which multiple independent association signals attained genome-wide significance: KCNQ1 (rs163184, P = 1.2 × 10−11; rs231361, P = 1.2 × 10−9; CEU r2 = 0.01) and CDKN2A/B (rs10811661, P = 3.7 × 10−27; rs944801, P = 2.4 × 10−9; CEU r2 = 0.01) (Fig. 2). Both signals at KCNQ1 have previously been reported in East Asian and European populations4,24.
