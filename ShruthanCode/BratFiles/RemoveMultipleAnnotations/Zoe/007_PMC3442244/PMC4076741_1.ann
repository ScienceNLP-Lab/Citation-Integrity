T0	Citation 1019 1038	Morris et al., 2012
T1	Context 792 1040	In a more recent large-scale meta-analysis which aimed to finely map the causal SNPs, only two of the 65 T2D susceptibility loci examined had a lead SNP resulting in a missense mutation (PPARG [rs1801282] and KCNJ11 [rs5215]) (Morris et al., 2012).
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	No mention of a missense mutation, no mention of KCNJ11 being implicated here like PPARG is, and no mention of only 2 T2D susceptiblity loci being implicated.
T2	CONTRADICT 33958 34379	However, it is the most connected gene for protein-level interactions (P < 0.005) in the PPI network, interacting with nine primary transcripts, eight implicated in monogenic diabetes or mapping to established T2D susceptibility loci (HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF4A, PLAGL1, TCF7L2, PPARG, PROX1 and NOTCH2) and one from a locus with a strong, but not genome-wide significant, association (ETS1, lead SNP rs7931302, P = 3.8 × 10−7).
