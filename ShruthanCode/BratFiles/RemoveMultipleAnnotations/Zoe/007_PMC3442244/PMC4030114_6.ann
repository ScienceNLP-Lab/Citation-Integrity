T1	Context 265 445	The largest T2D GWAS meta-analysis to date (12) may include all of the common T2D-associated loci of at least modest effect size that can be expected to be specifically identified.
T2	ACCURATE 3043 3796	The T2D-nominated component of Metabochip comprises 21,774 variants, including 5,057 “replication” SNPs that capture the strongest, independent (CEU r2< 0.2) autosomal association signals from the GWAS meta-analysis conducted by the DIAbetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium. This genome-wide meta-analysis (“DIAGRAMv3”) includes data from 12,171 cases and 56,862 controls of European descent imputed up to 2.5 million autosomal SNPs, and augments the previously published “DIAGRAMv2” meta-analysis4 with four additional GWAS (Supplementary Table 1). The T2D-nominated content of Metabochip includes a further 16,717 variants, most chosen from 1000 Genomes Project pilot data13, to fine-map 27 established susceptibility loci.
