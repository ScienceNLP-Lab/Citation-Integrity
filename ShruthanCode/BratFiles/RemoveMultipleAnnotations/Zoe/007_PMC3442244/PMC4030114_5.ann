T1	Context 541 943	We identified 10 predominantly IRâ€“related SNPs by 1) their significant association with HOMA-IR (P < 0.05) in the MAGIC data (12), 2) significant association with fasting insulin in the MAGIC GWAS conditional on BMI or BMI-SNP interaction (28), and/or 3) evidence of association with IR-related traits such as lower HDL cholesterol, higher triglycerides, higher BMI, and higher waist-to-hip ratio (18).
T2	ACCURATE 27084 27607	We used the published MAGIC meta-analysis (up to 37,037 non-diabetic individuals) of HOMA indices of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity5 as these traits were not included in the enlarged Metabochip study34. The risk allele at ANK1 has features (nominally significant reduction in HOMA-B) indicating a primary effect on beta-cell function, whereas those at GRB14 and AKNRD55 are characteristic of loci acting primarily through insulin resistance (increased HOMA-IR) (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 10)
