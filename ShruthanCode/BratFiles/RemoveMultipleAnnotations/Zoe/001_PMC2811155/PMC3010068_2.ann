T1	Citation 736 757	Narendra et al., 2010
T2	Context 536 758	To achieve this, we applied two Parkin mutants: ParkinR275W, which translocates to depolarized mitochondria but fails to induce mitophagy; and ParkinC441R, which fails to translocate to mitochondria (Narendra et al., 2010)
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	The citing article says that the ParkinR275W mutation is involved in translocation to depolarized mitochondria but fails to induce mitophagy, which this reference article sentence agrees with.
#2	AnnotatorNotes T4	The citing article discusses how the C441R mutation of Parkin fails to translocate to mitochondria, and this snippet of the reference article, in agreement, discusses how C441R is among those to cause a moderate deficit in Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria. 
T3	ACCURATE 54076 54305	Interestingly, the R275W mutation in RING1 also exhibited a severe deficit in mitophagy (4.0Â±4%) (Figure 9D and 9E) even though it appears to largely retain its ability to translocate to uncoupled mitochondria (Figure 9A and 9B).
T4	ACCURATE 50994 51305	Mutations in conserved cysteines of the RING domains (the patient mutations C253Y, C289G, and C441R and the engineered mutation C332S) completely disrupt recruitment at 1 h of CCCP treatment, as do mutations (patient mutation Q311X and engineered mutation T415X) that result in loss of RING2 (Figure 9A and 9B).
