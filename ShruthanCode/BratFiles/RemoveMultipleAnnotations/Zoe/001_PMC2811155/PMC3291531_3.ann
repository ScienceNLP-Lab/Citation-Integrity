T2	Citation 488 492	[39]
T1	Context 365 864	These observations, together with the finding that the normally labile PINK1 protein is stabilized on damaged mitochondria [39], suggest a scenario whereby the accumulation of PINK1 on damaged mitochondria and the subsequent turnover of Miro could exert neuroprotection by (1) preventing damaged mitochondria from being anterogradely transported along the axons, thus increasing their chance of getting eliminated in the soma; and (2) promoting elimination of damaged mitochondria through mitophagy.
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	This sentence directly agrees with claims by the citing article, which indicates that PINK1 is stabilized on damaged mitochondria.
T3	ACCURATE 8129 8421	Here, we show that full-length PINK1 accumulates selectively on dysfunctional mitochondria, and that Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria and subsequent Parkin-induced mitophagy are strictly dependent on PINK1's mitochondrial targeting signal and depolarization-induced accumulation
