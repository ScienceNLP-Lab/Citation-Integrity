T1	Context 2259 2468	Because PINK1 kinase activity is required for many Parkin functions and Parkin acts downstream of PINK1 [11], [14], [76], increased JNK signaling in Pink1−/− mice may in part be due to reduced Parkin activity.
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	The citing article says that Parkin acts downstream of PINK1, aligning with this statement by the reference paper. 
#2	AnnotatorNotes T4	The citing article says that PINK1 kinase activity is required for many Parkin functions, as is reflected here by the reference paper. 
T3	ACCURATE 34706 34982	Consistent with genetic studies in Drosophila, these findings show that Parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria and Parkin-induced mitophagy are downstream of PINK1 expression, whereas PINK1 accumulation in response to depolarization is upstream of Parkin recruitment
T4	ACCURATE 35097 35189	The expression of mitochondrial PINK1 is necessary for recruitment of Parkin to mitochondria
