T1	Context 1158 1531	This contrasts with our previous work using short hairpin RNAi targeting a different site in PARL mRNA that was interpreted to exclude PARL as a protease for PINK1 cleavage, likely owing to insufficient knockdown of endogenous PARL in HeLa cells and to insufficient expression of ectopic PINK1 in PARL knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; Narendra et al., 2010)
#1	AnnotatorNotes T4	Citing article says that there is an insufficient knockdown of endogenous PARL in HeLa cells, which causes insufficient expression of ectopic PINK1 in PARL knockout. This reference article sentence illustrates accordingly that PARL knockdown did not induce accumulation/expression of endogenous PINK1 in HeLa cells. 
T2	ACCURATE 58293 58517	Although the intramembrane serine protease Rhomboid-7 appears to be required for PINK1 cleavage in Drosophila [31], our results suggest that PARL, its mammalian ortholog, is not required for PINK1 cleavage in mammalian cells
T4	ACCURATE 23357 23532	Knockdown of PARL did not appreciably change basal levels of endogenous PINK1 or augment the depolarization-induced accumulation of endogenous PINK1 in HeLa cells (Figure S2B)
