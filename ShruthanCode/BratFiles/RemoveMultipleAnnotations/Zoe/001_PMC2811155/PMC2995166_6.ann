T5	Citation 1374 1395	Narendra et al., 2010
T1	Context 1223 1541	These results suggest that in contrast to FL, the CCCP-stabilized form of PINK1 that localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane facing the cytosol (Narendra et al., 2010), the 60-kD Î”MTS-PINK1, which appears in the absence of PARL, and the 52-kD PINK1 are protease-protected within polarized mitochondria (Fig. 1 d)
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	The citing article says that PINK1 localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane facing the cytosol, and this paragraph from the reference article demonstrates how this method was initiated and similarly found PINK1 to localize at the outer mitochondrial membrane and face the cytosol.
T4	ACCURATE 42029 42205	Next, we tested whether Parkin recruitment following increased PINK1 expression on the mitochondria is sufficient to induce mitophagy in the absence of depolarization with CCCP
T6	ACCURATE 42711 42861	These data demonstrate that stable expression of PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane is sufficient to induce mitophagy in the presence of Parkin
