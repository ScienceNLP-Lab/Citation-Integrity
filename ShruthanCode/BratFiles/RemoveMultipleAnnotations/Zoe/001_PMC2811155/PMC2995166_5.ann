T4	Citation 251 272	Narendra et al., 2010
T1	Context 0 274	Treatment of cells with a proteosome inhibitor stabilizes a 52-kD PINK1 fragment (Lin and Kang, 2008; Zhou et al., 2008), suggesting that proteosome-independent proteolysis yields a 52-kD form of PINK1 that is subsequently degraded by the proteosome (Narendra et al., 2010).
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	The citing article says that a proteosome independent proteolysis yields a 52-kD form of PINK1 that is degraded by the proteosome. In this snippet of the reference article, the authors similarly illustrate how PINK1 can be proteolytically cleaved into an ~52kDa fragment which can be degraded by the proteasome: this aligns with the citation. 
#2	AnnotatorNotes T3	The citing article says that PINK1 is subsequently degraded by the proteosome...same as this sentence in the reference article. 
T2	ACCURATE 16559 16754	Full- length PINK1 (∼63 kDa), which is anchored in the mitochondrial membrane, is proteolytically cleaved into an ∼52-kDa cytosolic fragment that can be degraded by the proteasome [22],[28]–[30].
T3	ACCURATE 19996 20284	Taken together, these results support a two-step model for the processing of PINK1: first, full-length PINK1 is cleaved into the ∼52-kDa short form in a voltage-dependent, proteasome-independent manner, and second, the short form of PINK1 is rapidly degraded by the proteasome (Figure 2B)
