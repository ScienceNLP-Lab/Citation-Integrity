T1	MultiCitation 939 943	[39]
T2	Context 744 944	A decline in mitochondrial membrane-potential induced by the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was reported to activate the PINK1/Parkin pathway [13], [14], [39].
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	The citing article argues that a decline in mitochondrial membrane-potential induced by CCP was reported to activate the PINK1/ Parkin pathway. However, this sentence from the reference article indicates that PINK1 on mitochondria will sufficiently recruit Parkin to mitochondria regardless of membrane potential (and CCCP was used in this method previously in the paragraph). These two kind of contradict one another: this reference article is arguing that PINK1/Parkin will still function regardless of membrane potential. 
T3	CONTRADICT 39120 39287	Together, these data demonstrate that stable expression of PINK1 on mitochondria is sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, regardless of membrane potential
