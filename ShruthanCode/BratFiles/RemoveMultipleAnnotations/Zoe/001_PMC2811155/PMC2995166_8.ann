T7	MultiCitation 1663 1684	Narendra et al., 2010
T1	Context 1547 1885	When we treated HeLa cells stably expressing YFP-Parkin with MG132 for 8 h to accumulate the 52-kD PINK1 (Fig. 1 c; Narendra et al., 2010), we detected no mitochondrial translocation of Parkin (Fig. 2 d), which is consistent with import and PARL-mediated cleavage of PINK1 in the inner mitochondrial membrane in the absence of uncoupling.
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	The citing article claims that HeLa cells stably expressing YFP-Parkin were treated with MG132 for 8 hours to accumulate 52kd PINK1. The reference article says that MG132 was only added in the last hour of treatment (and goes on to say the 52kDa band appears like the citing article did mention). Perhaps the mistake the citing authors made was that the reference article indicated that AP21967 was applied for 8 h, but not MG132.
T3	CONTRADICT 20275 20525	When MG132 is added during the final hour of treatment in HeLa cells treated with vehicle, an âˆ¼52-kDa band appears, consistent with the cleavage product of full-length Parkin described in previous reports [22],[28],[30] (Figure 2A, lane 1 vs. lane 2)
