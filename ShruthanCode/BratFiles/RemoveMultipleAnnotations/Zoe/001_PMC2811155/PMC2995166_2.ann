T1	MultiCitation 359 380	Narendra et al., 2010
T2	Context 62 382	Although endogenous PINK1 protein expression is constitutively low owing to rapid turnover, PINK1 proteolysis is inhibited by mitochondrial uncoupling, allowing a robust increase in expression when a mitochondrion is damaged and loses membrane potential (Lin and Kang, 2008; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010).
#1	AnnotatorNotes T4	Citing article says that PINK1 proteolysis is inhibited by mitochondrial uncoupling, which increases expression when there's damaged mitochondrion...this is related to proteolysis to maintain PINK1, which is what this sentence in the reference article also is referring to. 
#2	AnnotatorNotes T3	See note for other highlighted Accurate marker: same reasoning
T3	ACCURATE 2887 3076	In addition, they support a novel model for the negative selection of damaged mitochondria, in which PINK1 signals mitochondrial dysfunction to Parkin, and Parkin promotes their elimination
T4	ACCURATE 2255 2522	Here, we show that expression of PINK1 on individual mitochondria is regulated by voltage- dependent proteolysis to maintain low levels of PINK1 on healthy, polarized mitochondria, while facilitating the rapid accumulation of PINK1 on mitochondria that sustain damage
