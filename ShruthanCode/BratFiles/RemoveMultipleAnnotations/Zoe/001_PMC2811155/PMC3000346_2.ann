T1	Citation 386 390	[12]
T2	Context 265 391	This translocation of Parkin requires the function of PINK1, which is stabilized and accumulates on damaged mitochondria [12].
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	This section from the reference article agrees with claims by the citing article, which indicated that PINK1's function is to accumulate upon damaged mitochondria. 
#2	AnnotatorNotes T4	The citing article claimed that PINK1 accumulates on damaged mitochondria with low membrane potential. This sentence from the reference article demonstrates that finding. 
T3	ACCURATE 6500 6792	Here, we show that full-length PINK1 accumulates selectively on dysfunctional mitochondria, and that Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria and subsequent Parkin-induced mitophagy are strictly dependent on PINK1's mitochondrial targeting signal and depolarization-induced accumulation
T4	ACCURATE 13900 14071	Similar to results with Parkin reported previously [21], we found that PINK1-YFP accumulates preferentially on damaged mitochondria with low membrane potential (Figure 1G)
