T3	MultiCitation 713 715	42
T1	Context 614 721	In TREX1-depleted cells, escaped HIV-1 DNA is sensed by DNA sensor cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) (42, 43).
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	Contradicts the citation which claims that HIV-1 is sensed by DNA sensory cyclic GMP-AMP synthase
#2	AnnotatorNotes T4	Here it says "suggesting that an unknown sensor detects HIV DNA", but the citing article says HIV-1 DNA is sensed specifically by DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase. 
T2	CONTRADICT 27169 27290	Thus, HIV DNA is detected by a pathway that signals though STING, TBK1 and IRF3 and does not involve any known DNA sensor
T4	CONTRADICT 26071 26570	Similarly, siRNA targeting Tbk1, which encodes an IRF3 kinase, also strongly inhibited HIV-stimulated IFN-β expression (Fig. 6b). siRNAs against DNA sensor genes (Tlr917, Aim218, Irrfip119, Hmgb220), RIG-I (Ddx58), which recognizes RNA transcribed from cytosolic DNA21,22, or its adaptor Mavs (also known as IPS-1, VISA, CARDIF)23-26, did not suppress HIV- stimulated IFN-β expression, suggesting that an unknown sensor detects HIV DNA, or that multiple known DNA sensors might function redundantly.
