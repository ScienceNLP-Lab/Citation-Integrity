T1	Context 652 1002	In the absence of TREX1, HIV infection triggers a robust type I IFN response strictly dependent upon the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized adaptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (Yan et al., 2010)
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	The citing article mentions how HIV infection triggers IFN response dependent on the cytosolic DNA, STING, TBK1, and IRF3 just like this excerpt from the reference article.IR
T2	ACCURATE 2437 2690	TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway. HIV-stimulated IFN production in cells deficient in TREX1 did not involve known nucleic acid sensors.
