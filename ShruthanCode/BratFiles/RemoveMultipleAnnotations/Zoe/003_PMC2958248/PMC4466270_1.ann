T1	Context 488 719	However, recent discoveries have shown that human conventional DCs (cDC) are generally capable of generating IFN-I responses to HIV-1, but HIV-1 seems to be able to escape from such cell-intrinsic immunity in most patients [16â€“18].
T2	ACCURATE 32838 33351	We did not examine whether TREX1 affects IFN production by pDCs, the major source of Type I IFNs during HIV infection. HIV replication is inefficient in DCs. IFN stimulation in pDCs appears to be triggered mostly by endocytosed virus, whose gRNA is recognized by TLR7 in endosomes37. Productive HIV infection of macrophages and T cells, however, involves viral membrane fusion with the cell membrane and direct uncoating of the viral capsid into the cytosol, bypassing the endosomal compartment and TLR signaling.
