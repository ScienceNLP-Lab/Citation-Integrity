In Trex1−/− mouse cells and human CD4+ T cells and macrophages in which TREX1 was inhibited by RNA interference, cytosolic HIV DNA accumulated, and HIV infection induced type I IFN that inhibited HIV replication and spreading.
T4	ACCURATE 4141 4364	TREX1 binds to transfected immunostimulatory DNA (ISD), and Trex1−/− cells accumulate cytoplasmic DNA derived from endogenous retroelements, which activates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent IFN expression6,7.
