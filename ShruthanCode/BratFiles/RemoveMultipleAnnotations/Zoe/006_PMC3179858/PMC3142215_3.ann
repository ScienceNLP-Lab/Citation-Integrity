T1	Context 388 589	Both studies confirmed that Vpx interacts with SAMHD1 and induces proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1 in THP-1 cells or macrophages, which can be restored by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor [9,10].
T3	ACCURATE 11780 11888	Significantly, Vpx induced an almost complete degradation of SAMHD1 in cells treated with the control siRNAs
T5	ACCURATE 9827 10228	We observed that wild type Vpx readily depleted endogenous SAMHD1 levels. In contrast, VpxQ76A, which is defective for DCAF1 binding12, did not decrease SAMHD1 levels. Importantly, the effect of Vpx was blocked when macrophages were exposed to the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prior to and during infection with Vpx-loaded SIV VLP (Figure 3b). We conclude that Vpx programs SAMHD1 for destruction in MDM
