T1	Context 773 1003	Recent studies have identified a host SAM-domain HD-domain containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) as a target for Vpx-mediated proteosomal degradation, which overcomes a post-entry block to reverse transcription in myeloid cells [158,159].
T2	ACCURATE 2240 2583	Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1). Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
T3	ACCURATE 18416 18636	Alternatively, cell type specific differences in early post-entry events involved in viral core uncoating and/or reverse transcription complex function may make HIV/SIV prone to SAMHD1 specifically in myeloid cells25,26.
