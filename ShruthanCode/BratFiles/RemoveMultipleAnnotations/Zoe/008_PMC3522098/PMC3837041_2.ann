T2	Context 0 368	PGC-1α and PRDM16 are transcriptional coactivators involved in the control of energy metabolism, and ectopic expression of PGC-1α and PRDM16 in WAT induces acquisition of BAT features, including expression of mitochondrial and fatty acid oxidation and thermogenic genes to limit weight gain and improve glucose intolerance in response to a high-fat diet (HFD) (20–23).
T4	ACCURATE 7243 7510	As shown in Fig 1e, the media from cells expressing ectopic PGC1α increased the mRNA levels of several brown fat-specific genes (Fig. 1e). This suggested that PGC1α causes the muscle cells to secrete molecule(s) that can induce a thermogenic gene program in the cells
T3	ACCURATE 1090 1428	Exercise benefits a variety of organ systems in mammals, and some of the best- recognized effects of exercise on muscle are mediated by the transcriptional coactivator PGC1α Here we show that PGC1α expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of Fndc5, a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a new hormone, irisin
