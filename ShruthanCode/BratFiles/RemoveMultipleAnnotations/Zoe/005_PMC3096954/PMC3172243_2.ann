T1	Citation 593 597	[20]
T2	Context 415 598	In contrast, the Basal-like and Claudin-low carcinomas are mostly triple negative breast cancers (ER-PR-Her2-) associated with high resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis [20].
T3	ACCURATE 50014 50417	Acquisition of EMT and/or stem cell-like biological processes has been associated with therapeutic resistance [7,43,44]. We observed that claudin-low tumors do show a lower pCR rate than basal-like tumors (Figure 3a); however, the pCR rate of claudin-low tumors was roughly equivalent to that of the HER2-enriched subtype (without anti-HER2 therapies) and much higher than luminal A or luminal B tumors.
T4	ACCURATE 32012 32394	Across all three databases, claudin-low tumors showed a prevalence of 7 to 14%, and were mostly ER-/PR-/HER2- (also known as triple-negative tumors, 61 to 71%). Conversely, the majority of triple-negative tumors were either basal-like (39 to 54%) or claudin-low (25 to 39%), followed by HER2-enriched (7 to 14%), luminal B (4 to 7%), luminal A (4 to 5%) and normal breast-like (1%).
