T1	MultiCitation 795 796	7
T2	Context 643 797	Claudin-low tumors express mesenchymal genes such as Twist1, Twist2, Zeb1, Zeb2, Slug and Snail and low levels of E-cadherin and claudins 3, 4 and 7 [6,7]
T3	ACCURATE 4466 4696	In contrast to the basal-like subtype, we provide evidence that claudin-low tumors are more enriched in epithelial-to- mesenchymal transition (EMT) features, immune system responses, and stem cell- associated biological processes.
T4	ACCURATE 21062 21375	These findings, together with the low expression of epithelial cell-cell adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin, are consistent with an EMT (changes in cell phenotype between epithelial and mesenchymal states) [31] in claudin-low tumors and a potential recruitment of multiple types of leukocytes into these tumors
T5	ACCURATE 24768 25232	These nine cell lines (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, Hs578T, BT549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM1315MO2, SUM159PT and HBL100) showed a gene expression pattern similar to the claudin-low tumor subtype with the lowest expression of genes involved in epithelial cell-cell adhesion (i.e., E-cadherin and claudins 3, 4 and 7), luminal differentiation (i.e., CD24, EpCAM) and high values for the CD44/CD24 and CD49f/EpCAM mRNA ratios (Figure S4, Table S3 in Additional file 1).
