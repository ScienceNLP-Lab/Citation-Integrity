T1	Context 531 823	To estimate the expression of the OTBC signature across the intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer, we calculated the mean expression of both gene lists (that is, up- and downregulated) in the entire median-centered UNC337 dataset (n = 327) by using the subtype calls described in [6].
T2	ACCURATE 61277 61511	Mean expression of the top highly expressed (n = 833) and low expressed (n = 642) genes in claudin-low cell lines across 337 human breast tumor samples classified according to intrinsic subtype, including the normal breast-like group.
T4	ACCURATE 5570 5830	All microarray and patient clinical data are available in the University of North Carolina (UNC) Microarray Database [10] and have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number GEO:GSE18229 (referred to here as the UNC337 set).
T5	ACCURATE 6505 6669	In all data sets, genes were median-centered within each data set and samples were standardized to zero mean and unit variance before other analyses were performed.
T6	ACCURATE 36825 37054	c) Tumors and the normal breast-like group from the UNC337 database. (d) Breast cancer cell lines. Except for the nine claudin-low cell lines, we used the subtype calls (luminal [L] and basal [B]) as reported in Neve et al. [21].
