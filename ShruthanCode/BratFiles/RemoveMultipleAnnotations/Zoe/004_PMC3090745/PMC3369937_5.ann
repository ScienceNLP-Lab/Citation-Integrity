T1	Context 1796 1945	Nevertheless, we did find associations with cisSNPs for ABCA7, a novel AD risk locus gene [28], [47] and MAPT [52], [53], [24], [54] implicated in AD
T2	ACCURATE 16144 16458	In our Stage 1+2 analysis, we obtained suggestive evidence for association with ABCA7 SNP rs3752246 (PM = 5.8 × 10−7, and PJ = 5.0 × 10−7), which is a missense variant (G1527A) that may alter the function of the ABCA7 protein (see Supplementary Table 6 for functional SNPs in LD with SNPs yielding PM or PJ < 10−4)
