T1	Context 0 387	To investigate whether any of the significant brain cisSNPs may influence risk of AD, we compared our eGWAS results to the AD risk associations from the large AD GWAS conducted by ADGC [28]. We obtained results of meta-analyses for the ADGC Stage 1+2 cohort (11,840 LOAD vs. 10,931 controls) [28] and investigated those SNPs with suggestive AD risk association in this dataset (p <10âˆ’3).
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	The citation indicates 11840 LOAD vs 10931 controls (of which the meta-analysis is detailed in this paragraph)
