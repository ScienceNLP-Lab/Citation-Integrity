T4	MultiCitation 261 265	[28]
T1	Context 0 290	Despite the enrichment of our samples with tissue from AD subjects and our use of both cerebellar and temporal cortex tissue, we did not identify strong transcript associations for some of the top genes recently implicated in AD risk in large LOAD GWAS studies [28], [39], [40], [47], [48].
T2	ACCURATE 14516 14741	Another locus studied further in Stages 2 and 3 centered on EPHA1. Previous work provided suggestive evidence that this is a LOAD risk locus, although the associations did not reach genome-wide significance (P = 1.7 × 10−6)2.
T3	ACCURATE 15194 15380	In Stages 1 and 2, strong evidence for association was also obtained for SNPs in CD33, a gene located approximately 6Mb from APOE, but the results did not reach genome-wide significance.
