T2	Context 795 1041	In addition, although it is well established that acute inhibition of mTOR impairs synaptic plasticity, it was recently reported that chronic treatment with rapamycin improved behavior of AD transgenic mice [13], [14], although effects were mild.
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	The citing article says that it has been reported that chronic treatment of rapamycin improved behavior of AD transgenic mice (although effects were mild). I believe that this is an oversimplification. While the reference article does indicate the transgenic (rapamycin treatment) groups as having spent more time engaged in swim/behavioral activity, there is no significance found. The citing article inaccurately claims that rapamycin "improves behavior", but the reference article here that the citing authors are using does not indicate or confirm that improvement. Oppositely, there is no significance, and it is over-simplified for the citing authors to state that "effects were mild" when effects statistically did not exist at all. 
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 10453 10781	Although transgenic groups spent more time engaged in thigmotactic swim, as described[31] (** P<0.001, Bonferroni's post hoc test applied to a significant effect of genotype [F(3,440) = 15.04, P<0.0001, two- way ANOVA], no significant difference in percent time spent in thigmotactic swim was observed between transgenic groups.
