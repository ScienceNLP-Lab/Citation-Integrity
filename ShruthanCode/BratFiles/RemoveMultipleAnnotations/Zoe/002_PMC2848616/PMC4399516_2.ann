T2	Context 276 356	mTOR also modulates the metabolism of APP by regulating β- and γ-secretase.23,44
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	The citing article claims that this reference paper discussed how mTOR modulates metabolism of APP by regulating B-and y-secretase. In this reference paper, there is no mention of APP metabolism, or of either B-or y-secretase. B-secretase is involved in making amyloid-beta; however, that is only something one would have to already know previously. This citation does not demonstrate that, and therefore seems like it does not align with the reference paper's true finndings.
