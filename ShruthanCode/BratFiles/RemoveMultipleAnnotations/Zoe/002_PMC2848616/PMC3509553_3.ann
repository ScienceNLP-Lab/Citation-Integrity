Also, the citing article mentions that autophagy is necessary for improvement of cognitive function as well as is important for the limitation of AB toxicity, which is exactly reflected here as well. 
T3	ACCURATE 2775 3085	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
