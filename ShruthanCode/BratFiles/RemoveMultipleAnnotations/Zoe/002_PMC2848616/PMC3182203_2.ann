T2	Context 758 934	We, and others, have previously shown that rapamycin reduces soluble Aβ and tau pathology and the associated early cognitive deficits in 6-month-old transgenic mice [29], [32].
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	The first part of the statement by the citing authors is proven accurate here; they had claimed that rapamycin reduces soluble AB pathology 
#2	AnnotatorNotes T4	Exactly aligns with claims by the citing article which indicated that rapamycin reduces soluble AB and reduces early cognitive deficits
#3	AnnotatorNotes T5	This section aligns with information indicated by the citing authors. Citing authors indicated that reduction of AB and reduction of cognitive decline was evident ini 6 month old rapamycin treated transgenic mice. Here, this section demonstrates these findings, while also indicating the time span of mouse age being between 4 and 7 months (in alignment with the citing authors).
T3	ACCURATE 11278 11413	rapamycin did not alter Aβ40 levels but significantly decreased soluble Aβ42 levels in the brains of transgenic PDAPP mice *, P = 0.02.
T4	ACCURATE 20864 21063	The data presented here are, to our knowledge, the first to show that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin decreased Aβ42 levels ( Fig. 2 ) and rescued cognitive function ( Fig. 1 ) in a mouse model of AD
