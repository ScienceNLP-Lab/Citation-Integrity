T1	Context 2311 2559	Prevotella-dominated healthy omnivore individuals were recently reported to have increased basal levels of serum TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide), a product of inflammation linked to atherogenesis, compared to Bacteroides-dominated healthy individuals
#1	AnnotatorNotes T4	The citing claim is proven in figure 2e, but neither 2e nor fig. 2 as a whole are mentioned in the reference article text, so this cannot be annotated as specified in the guidelines.
T2	ACCURATE 44486 44758	Of note, we observed a significant increase in baseline plasma TMAO concentrations in what historically was called enterotype 2 (Prevotella) (P < 0.05), a relatively rare enterotype that previously in one study was associated with low animal fat and protein consumption18.
T3	ACCURATE 44759 44937	Notably, in our study, 3 of the 4 individuals classified into enterotype 2 are self- identified omnivores suggesting more complexity in the human gut microbiome than anticipated.
T4	ACCURATE 15915 16071	Baseline plasma concentrations of TMAO associates with Enterotype 2 (Prevotella) in male and female subjects with a characterized gut microbiome enterotype.
T5	ACCURATE 6101 6196	TMAO was subsequently shown to be both proatherogenic and associated with cardiovascular risks.
