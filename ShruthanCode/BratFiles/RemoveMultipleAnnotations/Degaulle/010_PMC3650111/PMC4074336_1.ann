T1	Context 524 746	mouse studies [145] investigating how consumption of red meat may accelerate cardiovascular disease and inflammation in humans [146,147] suggest an additional and potentially serious limitation on probiotic supplementation
T2	ACCURATE 2098 2195	Intestinal microbiota metabolism of L-carnitine, a nutrient in red meat, promotes atherosclerosis
T3	ACCURATE 47569 47840	Our results suggest the safety of chronic L-carnitine supplementation should be examined, because high amounts of orally ingested carnitine may under some conditions prime our gut microbiota with enhanced capacity to produce TMAO, and potentially promote atherosclerosis.
T4	ACCURATE 3347 3514	Dietary supplementation of TMAO, or either carnitine or choline in mice with intact intestinal microbiota, significantly reduced reverse cholesterol transport in vivo.
