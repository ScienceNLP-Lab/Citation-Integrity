T3	MISQUOTE 56592 56753	Apolipoprotein E knockout mice on C57BL/6J background (C57BL/6J, Apoe−/−) were weaned at 28 days of age and placed on a standard chow control diet (Teklad 2018).
T4	MISQUOTE 2657 2887	Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice significantly altered cecal microbial composition, markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA/TMAO, and increased atherosclerosis, but not following suppression of intestinal microbiota.
