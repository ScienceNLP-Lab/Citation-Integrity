#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	As mentioned in PMC3749360_2, Table 1 shows the T-allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7202877 is presented as the risk allele for T2D, being associated with a 1.12 times higher risk for T2D over the G-allele, the allele the citing paper refers to. However, a causal link is not established between the citing paper stated mechanism for this lowered risk in the reference paper.
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 4359 4576	Combining Stage 1 and Stage 2 meta-analyses (Supplementary Fig. 2), we identified eight new T2D susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2).
