T1	Context 0 142	According to the most recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies, 63 individual SNPs have now been linked with diabetes risk [1].
T2	MISQUOTE 21474 21865	We performed sex-differentiated meta-analysis32 (Online Methods and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6) to test for association of each SNP with T2D, allowing for heterogeneity in allelic effects between males (20,219 cases, 54,604 controls) and females (14,621 cases, 60,377 controls), thereby identifying two additional loci achieving genome-wide significance (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 7).
T3	MISQUOTE 10449 10977	To determine the extent to which additional common variant associations contribute to the overall variance explained, we compared directional consistency in allelic effects between the two stages of the meta-analysis. Figure 1 presents the distribution of Z-scores from Stage 2, aligned to the risk allele from Stage 1, at a subset of 3,412 independent (CEU r2 < 0.05) T2D replication variants that excludes lead SNPs and possible proxies (CEU r2 â‰¥ 0.1) at the 63 newly discovered and established loci represented on Metabochip.
