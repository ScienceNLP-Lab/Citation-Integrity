T2	Context 688 872	Subsequent models using genome-wide complex trait analysis suggested that 63% of T2D susceptibility might be attributable to common genetic variation in the full set of GWAS SNPs (12).
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 15569 15761	The estimated liability-scale variance explained by the full set of GWAS SNPs was consistent between the two studies: 62.6% for DGI (95% CI 38.1–87.1%) and 63.9% for WTCCC (95% CI 52.1–75.8%).
