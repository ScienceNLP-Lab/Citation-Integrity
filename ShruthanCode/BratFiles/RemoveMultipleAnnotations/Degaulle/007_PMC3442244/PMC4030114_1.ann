T1	Context 0 277	The DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium recently published the largest T2D GWAS meta-analysis to date (DIAGRAMv3), identifying many additional common variants associated with T2D and bringing the total number of independent T2D loci to 65 (12).
T3	ACCURATE 1603 1848	To extend understanding of the genetic architecture and molecular basis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), we conducted a meta-analysis of genetic variants on the Metabochip involving 34,840 cases and 114,981 controls, overwhelmingly of European descent.
T4	ACCURATE 10331 10605	Assuming a T2D population prevalence of 8%, these 63 newly discovered and established autosomal loci together account for 5.7% of variance in disease susceptibility, as calculated by transforming dichotomous disease risk onto a continuous liability scale20 (Online Methods).
T5	ACCURATE 21632 22023	We performed sex-differentiated meta-analysis32 (Online Methods and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6) to test for association of each SNP with T2D, allowing for heterogeneity in allelic effects between males (20,219 cases, 54,604 controls) and females (14,621 cases, 60,377 controls), thereby identifying two additional loci achieving genome-wide significance (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 7).
T6	ACCURATE 3926 4200	This genome-wide meta-analysis (“DIAGRAMv3”) includes data from 12,171 cases and 56,862 controls of European descent imputed up to 2.5 million autosomal SNPs, and augments the previously published “DIAGRAMv2” meta-analysis4 with four additional GWAS (Supplementary Table 1).
