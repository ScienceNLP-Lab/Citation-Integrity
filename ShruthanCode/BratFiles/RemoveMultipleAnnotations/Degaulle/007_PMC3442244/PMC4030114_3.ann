T1	Context 343 453	65 index SNPs or their proxies as were available at the confirmed or newly identified loci from DIAGRAMv3 (12)
T3	ACCURATE 10693 10967	Assuming a T2D population prevalence of 8%, these 63 newly discovered and established autosomal loci together account for 5.7% of variance in disease susceptibility, as calculated by transforming dichotomous disease risk onto a continuous liability scale20 (Online Methods).
T4	ACCURATE 21994 22385	We performed sex-differentiated meta-analysis32 (Online Methods and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6) to test for association of each SNP with T2D, allowing for heterogeneity in allelic effects between males (20,219 cases, 54,604 controls) and females (14,621 cases, 60,377 controls), thereby identifying two additional loci achieving genome-wide significance (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 7).
