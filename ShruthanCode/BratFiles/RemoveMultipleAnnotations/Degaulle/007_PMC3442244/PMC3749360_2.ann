T1	Citation 874 876	10
T2	Context 763 877	the G allele had been previously associated with increased risk of type 1 diabetes (11) but lower risk of T2D (10)
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	See table 1: the T-allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7202877 is presented as the risk allele for T2D, being associated with a 1.12 times higher risk for T2D over the G-allele, the allele the citing paper refers to.
T3	ACCURATE 4486 4703	Combining Stage 1 and Stage 2 meta-analyses (Supplementary Fig. 2), we identified eight new T2D susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2).
