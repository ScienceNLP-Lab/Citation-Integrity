T1	Context 104 231	The lead SNP for a putative secondary association signal (rs944801) is located within an intron of ANRIL (Morris et al., 2012).
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	Morris et al. were looking for “independent (CEU r2 < 0.05) association signals that lie outside the recombination interval containing the lead SNP,” finding the lead SNP at rs10911661 and rs944801 that maps to ANRIL. As far as I can tell, though the locations of both SNPs are available in the supplementary material, their position relative to ANRIL and its introns is not specified.
