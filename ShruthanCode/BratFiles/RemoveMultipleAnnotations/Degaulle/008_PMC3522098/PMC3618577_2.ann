T2	Context 265 408	Overexpression of irisin in the liver of mice, via adenoviral delivery, increases energy expenditure and reduces high fat diet-induced obesity.
T3	ACCURATE 29795 30046	Perhaps more remarkable, viral delivery of irisin that causes only a moderate increase (~3 fold) in circulating levels stimulates a 10â€“20 fold increase in UCP1, increased energy expenditure and an improvement in glucose tolerance of high fat fed mice.
T4	ACCURATE 23633 23760	We used adenoviral vectors to express full-length Fndc5 (or a control GFP) and examined its biological and therapeutic effects.
