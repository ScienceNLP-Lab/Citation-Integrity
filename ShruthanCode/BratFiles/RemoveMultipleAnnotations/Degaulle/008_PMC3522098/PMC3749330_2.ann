T3	ACCURATE 778 855	A PGC1α-dependent myokine that drives browning of white fat and thermogenesis
T4	ACCURATE 1044 1209	Here we show that PGC1α expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of Fndc5, a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a new hormone, irisin.
T5	ACCURATE 1210 1347	Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to stimulate UCP1 expression and a broad program of brown fat-like development.
