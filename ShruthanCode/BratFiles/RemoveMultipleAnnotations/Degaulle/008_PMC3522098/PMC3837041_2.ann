T2	Context 0 368	PGC-1α and PRDM16 are transcriptional coactivators involved in the control of energy metabolism, and ectopic expression of PGC-1α and PRDM16 in WAT induces acquisition of BAT features, including expression of mitochondrial and fatty acid oxidation and thermogenic genes to limit weight gain and improve glucose intolerance in response to a high-fat diet (HFD) (20–23).
#1	AnnotatorNotes T4	PRDM16 is not studied extensively in this paper
T4	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 24358 24514	There were no changes in expression of UCP1 in the interscapular BAT, but we did observe a minor elevation in PRDM16 and PGC1α mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S8).
