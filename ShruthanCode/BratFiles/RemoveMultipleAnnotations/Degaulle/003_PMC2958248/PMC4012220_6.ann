T1	Context 1174 1487	HIV not only exploits many host factors for the successful completion of the life cycle (Brass et al., 2008; König et al., 2008), it also exploits several key host factors that are critical for subversion of innate immune responses in target cells (Doitsh et al., 2010, 2014; Manel et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2010)
T2	ACCURATE 2162 2313	TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway.
T3	ACCURATE 1935 2161	In Trex1−/− mouse cells and human CD4+ T cells and macrophages in which TREX1 was inhibited by RNA interference, cytosolic HIV DNA accumulated, and HIV infection induced type I IFN that inhibited HIV replication and spreading.
