T2	Context 59 198	mDCs from either HDs (n = 8) or ECs (n = 7) were cultured for 24 h in the presence of Poly I:C and 2 μg/mL of either ss- or ds-Gag DNA [41]
T4	IRRELEVANT 14762 15106	To identify which HIV nucleic acids trigger IFN-β expression, we transfected WT and Trex1−/− MEFs with synthetic 100 bp gag sequence oligonucleotides that correspond to HIV nucleic acids in the cytosol during reverse transcription (ssRNA to represent gRNA, RNA:DNA hybrid, ssDNA, dsDNA) and measured IFN-β mRNA 6 h later by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4a,b).
