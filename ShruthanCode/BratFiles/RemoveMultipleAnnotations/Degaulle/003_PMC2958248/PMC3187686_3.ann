T1	Context 777 931	TREX1 was proposed to degrade cytosolic DNA resulting from HIV-1 reverse transcription, which would otherwise be capable of inducing an IFN response [42].
T3	ACCURATE 36631 36799	At an MOI of 1, HIV infection produces many reverse transcripts (although only one per incoming gRNA), but very few copies manage to integrate into the host chromosome.
T4	ACCURATE 36800 36986	The remaining HIV DNA is cleared by TREX1, since cytosolic HIV DNA builds up when TREX1 function is deficient or inhibited and can be removed by expression of enzymatically active TREX1.
T5	ACCURATE 1605 1756	TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway.
