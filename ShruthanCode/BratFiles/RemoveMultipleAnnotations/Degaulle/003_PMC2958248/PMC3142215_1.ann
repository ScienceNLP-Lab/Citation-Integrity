T1	Context 356 547	The cellular exonuclease TREX1 was recently shown to bind and digest excess cytosolic HIV-1 DNA that would otherwise activate type I IFN expression and trigger an innate immune response [15].
T2	ACCURATE 1521 1672	TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway.
T3	ACCURATE 1229 1520	The cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 suppressed IFN triggered by HIV. In Trex1−/− mouse cells and human CD4+ T cells and macrophages in which TREX1 was inhibited by RNA interference, cytosolic HIV DNA accumulated, and HIV infection induced type I IFN that inhibited HIV replication and spreading.
