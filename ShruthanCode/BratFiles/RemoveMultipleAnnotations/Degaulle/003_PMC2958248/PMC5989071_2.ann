T1	MultiCitation 1853 1854	8
T2	Context 1760 1863	it has been previously shown that TREX1 degrades ssDNA and dsDNA and DNA in RNA/DNA hybrids (8, 30, 31)
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 16450 16553	All DNA-containing oligonucleotides, but not ssRNA, induced more IFN-β in Trex1−/− compared to WT MEFs.
T4	OVERSIMPLIFY 17999 18095	These results strongly suggest that TREX1 suppresses IFN-β induction by digesting cytosolic DNA.
