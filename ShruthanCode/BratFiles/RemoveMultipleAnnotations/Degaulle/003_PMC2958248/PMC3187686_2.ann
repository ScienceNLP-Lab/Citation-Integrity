T2	Context 656 776	Yan et al. proposed that TREX1 suppressed a type I IFN response that otherwise would be induced by HIV-1 infection [42].
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	Because IFN-γ is the only type II IFN, it is technically true that only Type I IFNs are suppressed by TREX1, but it may be more accurate to say TREX1 only suppresses IFN-β and -ω.                 
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 4603 4684	HIV did not induce IL-1β, IFN-α or IFN-γ in WT or Trex1−/− MEFs (data not shown).
