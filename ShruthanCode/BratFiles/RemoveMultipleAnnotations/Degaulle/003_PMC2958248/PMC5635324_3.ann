T1	Context 474 609	In macrophages and T cells, cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 digests escaped HIV-1 DNA that would otherwise trigger innate DNA sensing (42).
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 2275 2426	TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway.
T4	OVERSIMPLIFY 2427 2528	HIV-stimulated IFN production in cells deficient in TREX1 did not involve known nucleic acid sensors.
