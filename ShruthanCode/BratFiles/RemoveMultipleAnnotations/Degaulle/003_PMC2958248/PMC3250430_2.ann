T2	Context 2039 2242	It was demonstrated that in the absence of TREX1, a type I IFN response is induced that inhibits HIV replication and spreading, although the specific DNA sensor responsible remains to be identified [36].
T3	ACCURATE 32074 32303	Therefore our working model of the innate immune pathway activated by cytosolic HIV DNA starts with an unknown sensor (that may preferentially recognize ssDNA) that signals through STING, TBK1 and IRF3 to activate IFN expression.
T4	ACCURATE 2897 3123	In Trex1−/− mouse cells and human CD4+ T cells and macrophages in which TREX1 was inhibited by RNA interference, cytosolic HIV DNA accumulated, and HIV infection induced type I IFN that inhibited HIV replication and spreading.
