T2	Context 1561 1813	cell-intrinsic immune responses in DCs are inhibited by the host protein TREX1, a host exonuclease that degrades HIV-1 reverse transcripts, which otherwise trigger microbial DNA sensors, leading to cell-intrinsic secretion of type I interferons [18,29]
T5	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 32838 32956	We did not examine whether TREX1 affects IFN production by pDCs, the major source of Type I IFNs during HIV infection.
