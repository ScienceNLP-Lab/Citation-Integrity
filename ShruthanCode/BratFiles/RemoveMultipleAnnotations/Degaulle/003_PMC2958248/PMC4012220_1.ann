T1	Context 1072 1211	Since only a few copies of HIV DNA integrate, the bulk of HIV DNA remains in the cytosol unless cleared by host enzymes (Yan et al., 2010).
T2	ACCURATE 2400 2501	Few copies of HIV DNA integrate, leaving behind HIV DNA in the cytosol to be cleared by host enzymes.
T3	ACCURATE 11692 11946	Although cytosolic HIV DNA was ~10-fold more abundant in Trex1−/− than WT MEFs, HIV DNA integration was reduced in Trex1−/− vs WT cells, suggesting that most HIV DNA that accumulated in Trex1−/− cells did not contribute to productive infection (Fig. 3e).
