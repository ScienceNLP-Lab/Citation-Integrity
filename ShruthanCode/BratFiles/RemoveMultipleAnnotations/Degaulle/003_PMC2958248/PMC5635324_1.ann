T1	Context 0 205	Some of the earliest evidence that HIV-1 produces a stimulatory DNA PAMP during infection was obtained in human CD4+ T cells and macrophages that had been depleted for the cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 (42).
T2	ACCURATE 32709 32934	HIV-stimulated IFN activation in Trex1−/− cells is eliminated by treating infected cells with an RT inhibitor, but not an IN inhibitor, suggesting that HIV DNA, but not gRNA, is the nucleic acid that triggers innate immunity.
T3	ACCURATE 1524 1750	In Trex1−/− mouse cells and human CD4+ T cells and macrophages in which TREX1 was inhibited by RNA interference, cytosolic HIV DNA accumulated, and HIV infection induced type I IFN that inhibited HIV replication and spreading.
