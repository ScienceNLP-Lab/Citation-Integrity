T1	Context 1004 1208	overall HIV-1 replication in which TREX1 expression is suppressed or ablated is reduced compared replication in normal cells, because DNA sensing results in expression of antiviral IFNs (Yan et al., 2010)
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 31878 32107	Therefore our working model of the innate immune pathway activated by cytosolic HIV DNA starts with an unknown sensor (that may preferentially recognize ssDNA) that signals through STING, TBK1 and IRF3 to activate IFN expression.
