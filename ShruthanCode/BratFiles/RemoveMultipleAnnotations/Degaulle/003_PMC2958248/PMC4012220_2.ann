T1	MultiCitation 246 262	Yan et al., 2010
T2	Context 19 263	the HIV-encoded cytosolic DNA produced by reverse transcription does not trigger a cell-autonomous interferon (IFN) or inflammatory response in activated CD4 T cells and macrophages, its primary targets (Goldfeld et al., 1991; Yan et al., 2010)
T3	ACCURATE 30494 30603	HIV infection of its main target cells, macrophages and CD4+ T cells, does not induce cell-autonomous IFNs35.
T4	ACCURATE 2437 2588	TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway.
