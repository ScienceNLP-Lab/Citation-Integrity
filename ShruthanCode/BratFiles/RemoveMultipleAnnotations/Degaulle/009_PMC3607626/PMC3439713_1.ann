T1	Context 543 718	Voineagu et al.[13], who, included in their expression profiling study, used the AGRE data to perform an analysis searching for evidence of a genetic enrichment of immune loci
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	The usage of AGRE data is specified in the Figure 4 caption.
T3	ACCURATE 20574 20726	M12 showed highly significant enrichment for association signals (p = 5E-4), but neither M16 nor the list of DE genes showed such enrichment (Figure 4).
T4	ACCURATE 20237 20573	To test whether our findings are more generalizable, and determine whether the autism-associated transcriptional differences observed are likely to be causal, versus collateral effects or environmentally-induced changes, we tested whether our co-expression modules or the DE genes show enrichment for autism genetic association signals.
