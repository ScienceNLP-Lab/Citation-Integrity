T2	Context 99 300	Voineagu et al.[13], who used a complimentary approach to test for evidence of a genetic component for the up-regulation of immune response genes in the autistic brain using the same AGRE genotype data
#1	AnnotatorNotes T4	The usage of AGRE data is specified in the Figure 4 caption.
T3	ACCURATE 19029 19365	To test whether our findings are more generalizable, and determine whether the autism-associated transcriptional differences observed are likely to be causal, versus collateral effects or environmentally-induced changes, we tested whether our co-expression modules or the DE genes show enrichment for autism genetic association signals.
T4	ACCURATE 19366 19518	M12 showed highly significant enrichment for association signals (p = 5E-4), but neither M16 nor the list of DE genes showed such enrichment (Figure 4).
