T1	Context 291 419	Voineagu et al. [20] demonstrates a consistent overlap involving several pathways including repair- and immune-related processes
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	Glial cells are used in neuron repair, but the citing paper should've specified glial cells instead of the broad term of "repair-related processes"
T2	OVERSIMPLIFY 1291 1556	We further identify discrete modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism: a neuronal module enriched for known autism susceptibility genes, including the neuronal specific splicing factor A2BP1/FOX1, and a module enriched for immune genes and glial markers
