T1	Context 767 938	To date, a number of studies have investigated gene expression in ASD (for review see [29]), with three examining ASD brain tissue on a genome-wide scale [30], [31], [32].
T2	ACCURATE 22050 22321	The genome-wide analysis performed here significantly extends previous findings implicating synaptic dysfunction, as well as microglial and immune dysregulation in ASD6 by providing an unbiased systematic assessment of transcriptional alterations and their genetic basis.
T3	ACCURATE 2964 3154	We analyzed post-mortem brain tissue samples from 19 autism cases and 17 controls from the Autism Tissue Project and the Harvard brain bank (Supplementary Table1) using Illumina microarrays.
