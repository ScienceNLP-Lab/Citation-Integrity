T1	Context 264 479	A recent whole genome transcriptomic analysis of autism brain suggested candidate pathways in immune regulation and alternative splicing regulation in the temporal cortex, frontal cortex, and cerebellar vermis [13].
T2	ACCURATE 2056 2322	We further identify discrete modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism: a neuronal module enriched for known autism susceptibility genes, including the neuronal specific splicing factor A2BP1/FOX1, and a module enriched for immune genes and glial markers.
T3	ACCURATE 16325 16499	One of the hubs of the M12 module was A2BP1/FOX1, a neural- and muscle- specific alternative splicing regulator18 and the only splicing factor previously implicated in ASD16.
T4	ACCURATE 3214 3400	For each individual, we profiled three regions previously implicated in autism5: superior temporal gyrus (STG /Brodmannâ€™s area [BA] 41/42), prefrontal cortex (BA9) and cerebellar vermis.
