T3	ACCURATE 1754 2022	Here, we show that expression of PINK1 on individual mitochondria is regulated by voltage- dependent proteolysis to maintain low levels of PINK1 on healthy, polarized mitochondria, while facilitating the rapid accumulation of PINK1 on mitochondria that sustain damage.
T4	ACCURATE 2386 2576	In addition, they support a novel model for the negative selection of damaged mitochondria, in which PINK1 signals mitochondrial dysfunction to Parkin, and Parkin promotes their elimination.
