T1	Context 725 822	PINK1 is required for recruitment of Parkin to mitochondria with impaired membrane potential [11]
T2	ACCURATE 4785 4885	Parkin is selectively recruited from the cytosol to damaged mitochondria to trigger their autophagy.
T3	ACCURATE 5220 5454	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps.
