T1	Context 792 923	“increased” mfn levels in pink1 or parkin knockdown flies may reflect an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis in these mutants [17]
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	Flies (drosophila) are not studied at all in the reference paper. mfn (mitofusion) is only investigated in the context of mfn-null mouse cells. A connection between mitochondrial biogenesis and mfn levels is not mentioned either.
T2	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 32766 33009	Additionally, these results suggest that the selective turnover of dysfunctional mitochondria may be balanced by the biogenesis of new mitochondria, allowing exchange of damaged, dysfunctional mitochondria for healthy, functional mitochondria.
