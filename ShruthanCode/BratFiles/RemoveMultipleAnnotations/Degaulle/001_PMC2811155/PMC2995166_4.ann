T4	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 23219 23533	Although endogenous PARL could not be detected in HeLa cells, PARL shRNA inhibited expression of overexpressed PARL (Figure S2A and S2B). Knockdown of PARL did not appreciably change basal levels of endogenous PINK1 or augment the depolarization-induced accumulation of endogenous PINK1 in HeLa cells (Figure S2B).
