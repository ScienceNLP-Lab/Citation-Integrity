T3	ACCURATE 19996 20285	Taken together, these results support a two-step model for the processing of PINK1: first, full-length PINK1 is cleaved into the âˆ¼52-kDa short form in a voltage-dependent, proteasome-independent manner, and second, the short form of PINK1 is rapidly degraded by the proteasome (Figure 2B).
