T3	ACCURATE 37433 37601	Together, these data demonstrate that stable expression of PINK1 on mitochondria is sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, regardless of membrane potential.
T2	ACCURATE 36324 36644	We found that removing the first 110 amino acids of PINK1 prevents targeting of PINK1 to mitochondria, consistent with previous reports [39] (Figure 6B, middle panel); whereas the fusion of OPA3 (1–30) to PINK1 Δ1-110 restores mitochondrial targeting, likely to the outer mitochondrial membrane (Figure 6B, right panel).
