T1	Context 881 1090	endogenous PINK1 behaves similarly to the overexpressed PINK1 counterparts in that PINK1 FL accumulates under valinomycin treatment and PINK1 Δ1 and Δ2 accumulate under proteasome inhibitor treatment [9,12,22]
#1	AnnotatorNotes T1	FL: full length
T2	ACCURATE 9568 9777	This ∼63-kDa band also increases in the mitochondria-rich membrane fraction following treatment with valinomycin, which, unlike CCCP, depolarizes mitochondria by permeabilizing the membrane to K+ (Figure S1A).
T3	ACCURATE 20101 20352	When MG132 is added during the final hour of treatment in HeLa cells treated with vehicle, an ∼52-kDa band appears, consistent with the cleavage product of full-length Parkin described in previous reports [22],[28],[30] (Figure 2A, lane 1 vs. lane 2).
