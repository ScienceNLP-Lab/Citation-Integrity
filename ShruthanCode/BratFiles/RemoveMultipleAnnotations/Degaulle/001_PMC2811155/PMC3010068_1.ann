T1	Context 457 618	Parkin translocation and mitophagy induction require PINK1 activity (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010; Vives-Bauza et al., 2010)
T2	ACCURATE 1684 1918	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps.
T3	ACCURATE 1249 1349	Parkin is selectively recruited from the cytosol to damaged mitochondria to trigger their autophagy.
