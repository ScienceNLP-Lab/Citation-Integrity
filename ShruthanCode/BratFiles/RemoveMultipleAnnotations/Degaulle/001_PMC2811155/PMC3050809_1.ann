T1	Context 749 849	Under stress conditions, PINK1 recruits Parkin to dysfunctional mitochondria [14], [15], [16], [17].
T2	ACCURATE 1315 1415	Parkin is selectively recruited from the cytosol to damaged mitochondria to trigger their autophagy.
T3	ACCURATE 1750 1984	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps.
