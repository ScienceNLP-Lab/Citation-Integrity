T2	MultiCitation 2363 2367	[11]
T1	Context 2267 2367	PINK1 kinase activity is required for many Parkin functions and Parkin acts downstream of PINK1 [11]
T3	ACCURATE 3340 3574	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps.
T4	ACCURATE 26376 26504	A kinase-deficient (KD) version of PINK1 [28] also failed to reconstitute Parkin recruitment to mitochondria (Figure 3A and 3B).
T5	ACCURATE 25193 25345	Together, these results show that PINK1 accumulation is upstream of Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria and independent of Parkin expression.
