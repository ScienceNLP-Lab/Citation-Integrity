T2	Context 744 943	A decline in mitochondrial membrane-potential induced by the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was reported to activate the PINK1/Parkin pathway [13], [14], [39]
T3	ACCURATE 25357 25645	We found that, although YFP-Parkin is recruited to mitochondria in 43.3±8.1% (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) of PINK1+/+ primary MEFs after 3-h exposure to 20 µM CCCP, it is not detectably recruited to mitochondria in PINK1−/− MEFs, as assessed by confocal microscopy (Figure 3A and 3B).
