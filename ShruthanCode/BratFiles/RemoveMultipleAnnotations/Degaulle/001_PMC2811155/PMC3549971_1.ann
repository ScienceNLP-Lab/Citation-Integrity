T1	Context 954 1122	On the OMM, PINK1 recruits Parkin to mitochondria via its kinase activity (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010; Vives-Bauza et al., 2010).
T2	ACCURATE 59560 59826	Consistent with a role for phosphorylation in the activation of Parkin, we found a kinase-deficient version of PINK1 fails to rescue Parkin recruitment to mitochondria in PINK1 null MEFs (even though PINK1 KD appears to be processed identically to wild- type PINK1).
T4	ACCURATE 56301 56578	In addition, increased expression of PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane is sufficient for Parkin recruitment and Parkin-induced mitophagy, suggesting that loss of membrane potential activates Parkin recruitment primarily through the up-regulation of mitochondrial PINK1.
