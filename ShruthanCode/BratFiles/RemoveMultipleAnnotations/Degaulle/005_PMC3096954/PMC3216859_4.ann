T2	ACCURATE 17401 17701	Compared to the luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like subtypes, claudin-low tumors showed inconsistent expression of basal keratins (keratins 5, 14 and 17) and low expression of HER2 and luminal markers such as ER, PR, GATA3, keratins 18 and 19 and the luminal gene cluster (Figure 1a).
