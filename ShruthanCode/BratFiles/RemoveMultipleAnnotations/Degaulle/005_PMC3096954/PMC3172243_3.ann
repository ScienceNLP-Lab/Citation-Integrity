T1	Context 599 726	Claudin-low tumors have been recently discovered through large-scale microarray analysis of breast cancer specimens [20], [22].
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 51580 51809	The claudin- low nine-cell line centroid predictor developed here will assist immediately in identifying the claudin-low subtype and its possible predictive value in any neoadjuvant clinical trial with associated microarray data.
T4	OVERSIMPLIFY 51810 51985	However, we acknowledge a potential caveat of the nine-cell line claudin-low predictor, which is that tumors with high stromal content might also be identified as claudin-low.
