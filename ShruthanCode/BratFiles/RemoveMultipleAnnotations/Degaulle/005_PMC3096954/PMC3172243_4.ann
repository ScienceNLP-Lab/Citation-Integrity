T1	Context 727 869	The MDA-MB-231 cell line used in this study was originally described as Basal B and has been recently characterized as Claudin-low [20], [21].
T2	ACCURATE 24637 24864	The three major subgroups (luminal, basal B and basal A) identified previously by Neve et al. [21] were evident, with nine basal B cell lines clustering together with a node correlation of 0.59 (Figure S4 in Additional file 1).
T4	ACCURATE 25222 25686	These nine cell lines (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, Hs578T, BT549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM1315MO2, SUM159PT and HBL100) showed a gene expression pattern similar to the claudin-low tumor subtype with the lowest expression of genes involved in epithelial cell-cell adhesion (i.e., E-cadherin and claudins 3, 4 and 7), luminal differentiation (i.e., CD24, EpCAM) and high values for the CD44/CD24 and CD49f/EpCAM mRNA ratios (Figure S4, Table S3 in Additional file 1).
T5	ACCURATE 25687 26081	To complement these clustering analyses, we developed a claudin-low centroid- based predictor using the UNC337 tumor data set and the SigClust-defined claudin-low group versus all others, and objectively classified the 52 cell lines as claudin-low or not; as expected, the human tumor-based claudin-low predictor identified these nine cell lines as claudin-low (Figure S5 in Additional file 1).
