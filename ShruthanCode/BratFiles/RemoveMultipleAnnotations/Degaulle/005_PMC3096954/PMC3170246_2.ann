#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	does not mention Slug
T3	MISQUOTE 48894 49200	Consistent with this finding, we observed a high mRNA expression of known transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin such as SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST1, TWIST2, ZEB1 and ZEB2, and other EMT-inducing factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1a in claudin-low tumors [31] (Figure 1b, Figure S2 in Additional file 1).
