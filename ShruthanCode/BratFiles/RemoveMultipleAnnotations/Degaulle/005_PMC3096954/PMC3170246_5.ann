T1	Context 239 521	Although a number of human tumor cell lines have been identified as sharing features of claudin-low tumors (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, Hs578T, BT549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM1315MO2, SUM159PT and HBL100), fewer claudin-low, murine mammary tumor cell lines have been established [7].
T3	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 39715 40032	Moreover, we applied the differentiation predictor to the mouse data set of Herschkowitz et al. [5] (Figure 4e) and observed that the previously identified claudin-low murine samples scored the lowest, while the MMTV-Neu and MMTV-PyMT models, which are known luminal mammary adenocarcinoma models, scored the highest.
