T1	Context 13 173	Hrecka and colleagues identified SAMHD1 from HEK 293T cells expressing tagged Vpx in a proteomic screen using multidimensional protein identification technology
T3	ACCURATE 5341 5501	First, to capture the cellular proteins bound by Vpx, we transiently expressed a functional SIVmac 239 Vpx protein tagged with FLAG- and HA- epitopes in tandem.
T4	ACCURATE 6126 6351	All protein complexes were purified by two sequential immunoprecipitations of epitope tags, under native conditions, and their subunit composition was analyzed by Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT)18.
T5	ACCURATE 7280 7569	The most abundant of the candidate proteins uncovered in this screen was the innate immune SAM-domain HD-domain containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), which co- purified with both Vpx (6 spectra) and Vpx-CRL4DCAF1 complex (37 spectra), but not with CRL4DCAF1 complex alone (Supplementary Table I).
T2	ACCURATE 5188 5340	Specifically, we directed the assembly of three sets of protein complexes in HEK 293T cells for their subsequent proteomic characterization (Figure 2a).
