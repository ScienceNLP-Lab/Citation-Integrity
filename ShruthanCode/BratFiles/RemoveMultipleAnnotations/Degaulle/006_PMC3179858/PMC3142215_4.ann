T1	Context 456 592	SAMHD1 blocks HIV-1 reverse transcription, as silencing SAMHD1 in THP-1 cells [9] and macrophages [10] increases the levels of viral DNA
T2	ACCURATE 13874 14129	Quantification of viral reverse transcription intermediates showed that depleting SAMHD1 levels stimulated synthesis of viral full length cDNA by approximately 10-fold (Figure 4c), and again this effect was well pronounced even at the lowest doses of Vpx.
T4	ACCURATE 13047 13212	As shown in Figure 4, freshly isolated CD14+ monocytes cultured in the presence of M-CSF were infected with increasing, but suboptimal, doses of Vpx- loaded SIV VLP.
