T1	Context 1454 1592	Despite the fact that SAMHD1 is expressed in different cell types, it seems to restrict lentiviral infection specifically in myeloid cells
T2	ACCURATE 18377 18597	SAMHD1 is expressed in HEK 293T cells, undifferentiated THP-1 cells and other non-myeloid cell types that do not possess a Vpx-sensitive mechanism restricting primate lentivirus infection (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7).
T3	ACCURATE 18259 18376	One unanswered question is how myeloid cell specificity of SAMHD1-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infection is achieved?
