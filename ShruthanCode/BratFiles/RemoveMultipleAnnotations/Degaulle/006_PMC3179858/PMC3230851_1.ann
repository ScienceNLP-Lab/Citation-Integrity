T1	Context 773 1003	Recent studies have identified a host SAM-domain HD-domain containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) as a target for Vpx-mediated proteosomal degradation, which overcomes a post-entry block to reverse transcription in myeloid cells [158,159].
T2	ACCURATE 2381 2583	Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
T3	ACCURATE 14558 14813	Quantification of viral reverse transcription intermediates showed that depleting SAMHD1 levels stimulated synthesis of viral full length cDNA by approximately 10-fold (Figure 4c), and again this effect was well pronounced even at the lowest doses of Vpx.
