T2	Context 0 293	In this report, in addition to confirming independently the findings by Laguette et al. and Hrecka et al. [19], [20], we provide further evidence for the role of SAMHD1 as interferon-induced factor restricting HIV-1 replication in monocytes, the progenitors of macrophages and dendritic cells.
#1	AnnotatorNotes T5	It is not clear whether SAMHD1 prevents the interferon response or is triggered by interferons, so this is either a NSUB or CONTRADICT.
T5	CONTRADICT 2345 2645	Thus, our findings reveal that macrophages are defended from HIV-1 infection by a mechanism that prevents an unwanted interferon response triggered by self nucleic acids, and uncover an intricate relationship between innate immune mechanisms that control response to self and to retroviral pathogens.
