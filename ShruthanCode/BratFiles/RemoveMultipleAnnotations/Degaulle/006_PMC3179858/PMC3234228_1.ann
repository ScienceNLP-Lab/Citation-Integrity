T1	Context 342 570	Two recent publications identified Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) Domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) as the Vpx-sensitive restriction factor that inhibits HIV-1 infection of macrophages and dendritic cells [19], [20].
#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	This paper specifically focuses on macrophages, and does not investigate dendritic cells adequately.
T3	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 17791 18049	Of note, we observed that SAMHD1 levels are depleted by Vpx in both MDM and monocyte- derived dendritic cells in a Vpx glutamine Q76 dependent manner (data not shown) implicating SAMHD1 as the key AGS protein inhibiting lentivirus infection in myeloid cells.
