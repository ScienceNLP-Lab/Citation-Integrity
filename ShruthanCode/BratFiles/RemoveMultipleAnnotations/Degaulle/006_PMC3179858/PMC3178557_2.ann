T2	Context 2316 2431	Two recent studies identified SAMHD1 as a cellular factor that is specifically bound and degraded by Vpx [59] [60].
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 4125 4327	Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
T4	OVERSIMPLIFY 11898 12020	We conclude that Vpx specifically binds to, and recruits SAMHD1 to the DCAF1-DDB1 module of CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase.
