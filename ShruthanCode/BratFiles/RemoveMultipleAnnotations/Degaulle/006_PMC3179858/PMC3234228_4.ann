T1	Context 580 765	monocytes express SAMHD1 as an interferon-inducible factor (Figure 2E) that is degraded upon Vpx-supported HIV-1 infection confirming the results in dendritic cells [20] and macrophages
T2	ACCURATE 1736 1938	Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
T4	ACCURATE 841 929	Vpx relieves inhibition of HIV-1 infection of macrophages mediated by the SAMHD1 protein
