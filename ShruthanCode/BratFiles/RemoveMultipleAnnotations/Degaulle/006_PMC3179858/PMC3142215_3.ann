T1	Context 416 581	Vpx interacts with SAMHD1 and induces proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1 in THP-1 cells or macrophages, which can be restored by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor
#1	AnnotatorNotes T4	THP-1 cells are not used in the paper.
T4	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 17261 17481	SAMHD1 is expressed in HEK 293T cells, undifferentiated THP-1 cells and other non-myeloid cell types that do not possess a Vpx-sensitive mechanism restricting primate lentivirus infection (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7).
