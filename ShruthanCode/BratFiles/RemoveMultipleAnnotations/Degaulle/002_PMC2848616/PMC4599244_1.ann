T1	Context 1376 1488	inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease [37]
T2	ACCURATE 2395 2588	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of AÎ²42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
