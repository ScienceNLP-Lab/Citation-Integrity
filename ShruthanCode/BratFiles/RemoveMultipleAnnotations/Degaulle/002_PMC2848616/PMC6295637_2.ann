T2	Context 232 443	mTOR inhibition could improve learning and memory functions, reduce tau pathology (Caccamo et al., 2010[13]), increase autophagy and decrease the amyloid β level in animal models of AD (Spilman et al., 2010[75])
T3	ACCURATE 13402 13720	Rapamycin-fed transgenic PDAPP mice, however, showed improved learning ( Figure 1a ) and memory ( Figure 1b ), with improved performances on the last day of training and retention of the former location of the escape platform restored to levels indistinguishable from those of non-transgenic littermates ( Figure 1b ).
T4	ACCURATE 1803 2113	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
