T1	Context 484 630	There is also evidence of an association between mTOR signalling and beta-amyloid, although the nature of the association is uncertain [18,28,29].
T2	ACCURATE 5785 5859	The role of the mTOR pathway and of autophagy in AD is thus still unclear.
T3	ACCURATE 2322 2632	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
