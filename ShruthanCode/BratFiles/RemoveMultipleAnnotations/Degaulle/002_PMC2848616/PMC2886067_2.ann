T2	Context 369 510	recent publications indicate that pharmacological stimulation of autophagy can be beneficial and reduce Aβ mediated toxicity [44], [45], [46]
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 2259 2452	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of Aβ42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T4	OVERSIMPLIFY 2571 2881	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
