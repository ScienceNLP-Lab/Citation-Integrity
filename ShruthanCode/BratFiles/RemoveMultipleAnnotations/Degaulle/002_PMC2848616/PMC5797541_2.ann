T2	Context 530 756	A study performed by Spilman et al. (2010) on mouse model of AD reported that blocking the mTOR signaling with rapamycin relieves cognitive deficits and reduces amyloid pathology, likely by activating autophagy in brain cells.
T3	ACCURATE 2613 2923	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
