T2	Context 899 1012	it was recently reported that chronic treatment with rapamycin improved behavior of AD transgenic mice [13], [14]
T3	ACCURATE 2598 2791	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of AÎ²42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
