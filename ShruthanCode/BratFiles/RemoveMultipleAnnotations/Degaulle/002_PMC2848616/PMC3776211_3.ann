T1	Context 1010 1103	in animal models Rapamycin has been found to be a good candidate for the treatment of AD [29]
T3	ACCURATE 2010 2203	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of Aβ42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T4	ACCURATE 2204 2321	These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway can reduce Aβ42 levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice.
