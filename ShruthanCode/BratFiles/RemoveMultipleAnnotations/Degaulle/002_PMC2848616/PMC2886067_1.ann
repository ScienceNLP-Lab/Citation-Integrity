T1	Context 749 838	Autophagy has been shown to protect neurons from Aβ induced cytotoxicity [44], [45], [46]
T2	OVERSIMPLIFY 2057 2367	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 17011 17146	Autophagy is a key pathway for the clearance of aggregation-prone proteins and may have a protective role in proteinopathies[20], [39].
T4	OVERSIMPLIFY 4783 5106	While excessive autophagic activity can lead to cell death, increased autophagy has been shown to facilitate the clearance of aggregation- prone proteins such as Aβ[20], [21], [22], pathological prion protein[23], [24], and α-synuclein[25], and to promote neuronal survival in a variety of neurodegenerative disease models.
T5	OVERSIMPLIFY 1745 1938	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of Aβ42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
