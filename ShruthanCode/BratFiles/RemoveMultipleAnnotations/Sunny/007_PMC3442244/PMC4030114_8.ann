T1	Context 148 241	The DIAGRAMv3 meta-analysis consisted predominantly of populations of European ancestry (12).
T2	ACCURATE 4779 5053	This genome-wide meta-analysis (“DIAGRAMv3”) includes data from 12,171 cases and 56,862 controls of European descent imputed up to 2.5 million autosomal SNPs, and augments the previously published “DIAGRAMv2” meta-analysis4 with four additional GWAS (Supplementary Table 1).
T3	ACCURATE 2456 2701	To extend understanding of the genetic architecture and molecular basis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), we conducted a meta-analysis of genetic variants on the Metabochip involving 34,840 cases and 114,981 controls, overwhelmingly of European descent.
T4	ACCURATE 26629 26840	To gain a more complete picture of patterns of trait overlap, we first assessed the effect of T2D risk alleles on glycemic traits in European-descent meta- analyses from the MAGIC Investigators (Online Methods).
T5	ACCURATE 41188 41424	The Stage 2 meta-analysis consisted of 21,491 T2D cases and 55,647 controls across 25 studies from European descent populations and 1,178 T2D cases and 2,472 controls from one study of Pakistani descent (PROMIS) (Supplementary Table 1).
T6	ACCURATE 40266 40415	The Stage 1 meta-analysis consisted of 12,171 T2D cases and 56,862 controls across 12 GWAS from European descent populations (Supplementary Table 1).
