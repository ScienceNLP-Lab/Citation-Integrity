T1	Context 0 277	The DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium recently published the largest T2D GWAS meta-analysis to date (DIAGRAMv3), identifying many additional common variants associated with T2D and bringing the total number of independent T2D loci to 65 (12).
T2	ACCURATE 5007 5224	Combining Stage 1 and Stage 2 meta-analyses (Supplementary Fig. 2), we identified eight new T2D susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2).
