T2	Context 0 289	A fundamental challenge facing those wishing to determine which of the genes in a particular locus is responsible for affecting disease risk, and dissect how this/these act, is the very scale of the problem (currently more than 500 genes in total to interrogate, with others emerging) [35]
T3	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 9408 9591	Given the role played by rare ANK1 mutations in hereditary anemias, the HbA1C associations at this locus were assumed to be driven by abnormal erythrocyte development and/or function.
T4	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 9592 9792	However, our newly discovered independent association with T2D (in cohorts where HbA1C was not used for diagnosis) suggests that variation at this locus also has direct effects on glucose homeostasis.
T5	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 54308 54510	We first tested for enrichment of connectivity in the list of 77 primary transcripts (treating the 18 monogenic loci as a single locus to reduce confounding), and assessed significance via permutation4.
T6	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 26144 26479	In addition to the nine loci previously reported (MTNR1B, DGKB, ADCY5, PROX1, GCK, GCKR, TCF7L2, SLC30A8 and C2CD4A)4,5, four more T2D association signals were genome-wide significant for fasting glucose: CDKN2A/B (P = 5.7 × 10−18), ARAP1 (P = 1.2 × 10−10), IGF2BP2 (P = 1.8 × 10−8) and CDKAL1 (P = 2.0 × 10−8) (Supplementary Table 9).
T7	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 26480 26598	The ZBED3 locus also attained genome-wide significance with fasting glucose after adjustment for BMI (P = 1.2 × 10−8).
T8	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 26599 26858	In contrast, lead T2D SNPs at 27 of the newly discovered and established loci showed no evidence of association with fasting glucose (P > 0.05), despite sample sizes ranging from 38,424 to 132,999 individuals (Supplementary Table 10 and Supplementary Fig. 9).
