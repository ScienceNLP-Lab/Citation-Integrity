T1	Context 164 540	We identified 20 predominantly β-cell–associated SNPs by 1) their significant effect on homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-β (β < –0.008; P < 0.05) in the most recent Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) (12) and/or 2) a significant effect (P < 0.05) on one of the β-cell function indices (18): insulinogenic index or acute insulin response.
T2	ACCURATE 5100 5230	The strongest signals mapped to ZMIZ1 (P = 1.0 × 10−10), ANK1 (P = 2.5 × 10−10), and the region flanking KLHDC5 (P = 6.1 × 10−10).
T4	ACCURATE 27084 27298	We used the published MAGIC meta-analysis (up to 37,037 non-diabetic individuals) of HOMA indices of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity5 as these traits were not included in the enlarged Metabochip study34.
T5	ACCURATE 27299 27608	The risk allele at ANK1 has features (nominally significant reduction in HOMA-B) indicating a primary effect on beta-cell function, whereas those at GRB14 and AKNRD55 are characteristic of loci acting primarily through insulin resistance (increased HOMA-IR) (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 10).
T6	ACCURATE 48108 48390	We also considered surrogate estimates of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) derived by homeostasis model assessment in up to 38,238 individuals (from GWAS meta-analysis only since these traits were not investigated in the enlarged MAGIC Metabochip study).
