T1	Citation 193 212	Morris et al., 2012
T2	Context 0 214	The lead SNP at this locus is within the intron of the KCNQ1 protein-coding gene, yet the lead SNP for a putative secondary association signal is in the exon of an antisense lncRNA (KCNQ1OT1) (Morris et al., 2012).
T3	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 20124 20304	The low LD between GWAS and Metabochip lead SNPs at DGKB and KCNQ1 (both CEU r2 = 0.00) arises because they “switch” between independent association signals at these loci (Fig. 2).
