T0	MultiCitation 778 780	10
T1	Context 558 781	Of these SNPs, 66,000 were selected for efficient replication of top signals across multiple traits, with the hope that when tested in sufficiently large samples they might exceed genome-wide statistical significance (9,10)
T5	CONTRADICT 26474 26733	In contrast, lead T2D SNPs at 27 of the newly discovered and established loci showed no evidence of association with fasting glucose (P > 0.05), despite sample sizes ranging from 38,424 to 132,999 individuals (Supplementary Table 10 and Supplementary Fig. 9).
