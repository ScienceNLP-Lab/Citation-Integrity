T1	Context 541 670	We identified 10 predominantly IRâ€“related SNPs by 1) their significant association with HOMA-IR (P < 0.05) in the MAGIC data (12)
T2	ACCURATE 48108 48390	We also considered surrogate estimates of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) derived by homeostasis model assessment in up to 38,238 individuals (from GWAS meta-analysis only since these traits were not investigated in the enlarged MAGIC Metabochip study).
T3	ACCURATE 27300 27608	he risk allele at ANK1 has features (nominally significant reduction in HOMA-B) indicating a primary effect on beta-cell function, whereas those at GRB14 and AKNRD55 are characteristic of loci acting primarily through insulin resistance (increased HOMA-IR) (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 10).
