T5	Context 748 878	Interestingly, the G allele had been previously associated with increased risk of type 1 diabetes (11) but lower risk of T2D (10).
T2	ACCURATE 28416 28423	Finally
T3	ACCURATE 29502 29685	At six of the newly discovered loci, the lead T2D SNP showed strong cis-eQTL associations and was highly correlated (CEU r2 > 0.8) with the lead cis-eQTL SNP (Supplementary Table 13).
T4	ACCURATE 29686 29988	These “coincident” eQTL implicate GRB14 (omental fat), ANK1 (omental and subcutaneous fat, liver and prefrontal cortex), KLHDC5 (blood, T cells and CD4+ lymphocytes), BCAR1 (blood), ATP13A1 (at the CILP2 locus, blood and monocytes), HMG20A (liver) and LINGO1 (also at the HMG20A locus, adipose tissue).
