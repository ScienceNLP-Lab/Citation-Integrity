T6	Context 365 458	Increased incretin sensitivity improves β-cell function (13), thereby lowering T2D risk (10).
T1	ACCURATE 36764 36955	The majority of genes driving these cell-cycle enrichments were cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (CDKN2A/B, CDKN1C and CDKN2C) and cyclins that activate CDKs (CCNE2, CCND2 and CCNA2).
T3	ACCURATE 36956 37068	Many of these regulate CDK4 or CDK6, which are known to play a role in pancreatic beta-cell proliferation48, 49.
T4	ACCURATE 29375 29861	At six of the newly discovered loci, the lead T2D SNP showed strong cis-eQTL associations and was highly correlated (CEU r2 > 0.8) with the lead cis-eQTL SNP (Supplementary Table 13). These “coincident” eQTL implicate GRB14 (omental fat), ANK1 (omental and subcutaneous fat, liver and prefrontal cortex), KLHDC5 (blood, T cells and CD4+ lymphocytes), BCAR1 (blood), ATP13A1 (at the CILP2 locus, blood and monocytes), HMG20A (liver) and LINGO1 (also at the HMG20A locus, adipose tissue).
T5	ACCURATE 26914 27223	The risk allele at ANK1 has features (nominally significant reduction in HOMA-B) indicating a primary effect on beta-cell function, whereas those at GRB14 and AKNRD55 are characteristic of loci acting primarily through insulin resistance (increased HOMA-IR) (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 10).
