T1	Context 270 519	In the present analyses, we updated these GRS  to include as many of the 65 index SNPs or their proxies as were available at the confirmed or newly identified loci from DIAGRAMv3 (12) (Table 1 and Fig. 1), using previously reported methods (4,9,16).
T3	ACCURATE 5369 5586	Combining Stage 1 and Stage 2 meta-analyses (Supplementary Fig. 2), we identified eight new T2D susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2).
