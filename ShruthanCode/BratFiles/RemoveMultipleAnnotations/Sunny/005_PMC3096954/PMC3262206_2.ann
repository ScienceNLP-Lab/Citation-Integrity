T1	MultiCitation 984 985	6
T2	Context 703 990	Hallmarks of these tumors include a high enrichment for a CD44+/CD24-/low TIC signature, a downregulation of cell junction proteins such as cadherins and claudins, an enrichment in mesenchymal markers, high lymphocyte infiltrations, and high phenotypic resistance to chemotherapy [6,11].
T3	Context 475 637	Claudin-low carcinomas are mostly triple-negative - negative for progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER), and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
T4	ACCURATE 2394 2697	Clinically, the majority of claudin-low tumors are poor prognosis estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (triple negative) invasive ductal carcinomas with a high frequency of metaplastic and medullary differentiation.
T5	ACCURATE 4171 4577	More recently, a tumor initiating cell (TIC) genomic signature derived from CD44+/CD24-/low-sorted cells and mammospheres obtained from primary human breast tumors was found to be exclusively enriched by gene expression in the claudin-low subtype [6,7], and the expression of this CD44+/CD24-/low/claudin-low profile increased in posttreatment samples after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormone therapy [7].
T6	ACCURATE 2165 2393	Claudin-low tumors are characterized by the low to absent expression of luminal differentiation markers, high enrichment for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, immune response genes and cancer stem cell-like features.
T7	ACCURATE 34825 35012	These findings suggest that claudin-low tumors show some chemotherapy sensitivity but overall have a poor prognosis and may not be managed effectively with existing chemotherapy regimens.
