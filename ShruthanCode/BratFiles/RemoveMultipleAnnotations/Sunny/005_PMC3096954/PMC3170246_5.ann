T1	Context 239 521	Although a number of human tumor cell lines have been identified as sharing features of claudin-low tumors (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, Hs578T, BT549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM1315MO2, SUM159PT and HBL100), fewer claudin-low, murine mammary tumor cell lines have been established [7].
T2	ACCURATE 30784 30853	No murine normal mammary tissue sample was classified as claudin-low.
T3	ACCURATE 24879 25343	These nine cell lines (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, Hs578T, BT549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM1315MO2, SUM159PT and HBL100) showed a gene expression pattern similar to the claudin-low tumor subtype with the lowest expression of genes involved in epithelial cell-cell adhesion (i.e., E-cadherin and claudins 3, 4 and 7), luminal differentiation (i.e., CD24, EpCAM) and high values for the CD44/CD24 and CD49f/EpCAM mRNA ratios (Figure S4, Table S3 in Additional file 1).
T5	ACCURATE 30374 30783	These nine murine claudin-low tumor samples were derived from six different mouse models (Brca1Co/Co;TgMMTV-Cre;p53+/-, DMBA-induced, p53-/- transplant, p53+/- IR, TgMMTV-Neu and TgWAP-T121) and overall showed similar enrichment for EMT markers and human mesenchymal and stem cell-like signatures, including decreased expression of proliferative- and luminal-associated genes (Figure S6 in Additional file 1).
