T2	Context 643 798	Claudin-low tumors express mesenchymal genes such as Twist1, Twist2, Zeb1, Zeb2, Slug and Snail and low levels of E-cadherin and claudins 3, 4 and 7 [6,7].
T3	ACCURATE 48894 49200	Consistent with this finding, we observed a high mRNA expression of known transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin such as SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST1, TWIST2, ZEB1 and ZEB2, and other EMT-inducing factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1a in claudin-low tumors [31] (Figure 1b, Figure S2 in Additional file 1).
T4	ACCURATE 18182 18441	Right: Box-and-whisker plot for expression of the luminal and proliferation gene signatures. (b) Markers of EMT (vimentin [VIM], Snail-1 [SNAI1], Snail-2 [SNAI2], TWIST1, TWIST2, ZEB1, ZEB2, E-cadherin [CDH1], and claudins 3 [CLDN3], 4 [CLDN4] and 7 [CLDN7]).
