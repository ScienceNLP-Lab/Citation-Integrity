T1	Context 734 908	The immune status of mice may be particularly important when studying claudin-low tumors as one of the hallmarks of this tumor type is an increase in immune-related genes [7]
T2	ACCURATE 1757 1985	Claudin-low tumors are characterized by the low to absent expression of luminal differentiation markers, high enrichment for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, immune response genes and cancer stem cell-like features.
T3	ACCURATE 4578 4807	n contrast to the basal-like subtype, we provide evidence that claudin-low tumors are more enriched in epithelial-to- mesenchymal transition (EMT) features, immune system responses, and stem cell- associated biological processes.
T4	ACCURATE 19560 19978	Overall, claudin-low tumors highly expressed genes involved in immune system response (i.e. CD79b, CD14 and vav1), cell communication (chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 12), extracellular matrix (vimentin, fibroblast growth factor 7), cell differentiation (Kr√ºppel-like factor 2, interleukin 6), cell migration (integrin a5, moesin) and angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor C, matrix metallopeptidase 9) [29].
T6	ACCURATE 28692 29112	Because primary human claudin-low tumors are highly enriched for immune system genes (and lymphocytes) when supervised analyses are performed, the expression of nonepithelial cell genes would likely increase the false positivity of the human claudin-low predictor when applied to other tumor data sets, because, for instance, tumors would be called claudin-low or not based upon the high expression of immune cell genes.
T7	ACCURATE 30854 31097	These analyses suggest that a cell line centroid-based approach, by focusing on genes expressed in epithelial cells only, might give more accurate classification of tumors, which could be evaluated in future studies focused on tumor subtyping.
T8	ACCURATE 29113 29225	Therefore, we developed a claudin-low centroid-based predictor using the cell line database of Neve et al. [21].
T9	ACCURATE 29326 29497	he nine-cell line claudin-low predictor identified 37 samples (~11%) as claudin-low, including the 28 claudin-low samples previously identified by hierarchical clustering.
T10	ACCURATE 29923 30171	We then used the nine-cell line claudin-low predictor to identify this subtype in a mouse tumor database [5], which represents 13 different mouse models grouped in 10 different classes on the basis of their gene expression profiles (Groups I to X).
