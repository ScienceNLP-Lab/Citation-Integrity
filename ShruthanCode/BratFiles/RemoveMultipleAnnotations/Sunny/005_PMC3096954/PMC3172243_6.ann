T1	Context 550 729	CD44+/CD24- is considered a cancer stem cell or tumor initiating cell signature, and high CD44/CD24 ratios are characteristic of aggressive Claudin-low tumors and cell lines [20].
T2	ACCURATE 25090 25554	These nine cell lines (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, Hs578T, BT549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM1315MO2, SUM159PT and HBL100) showed a gene expression pattern similar to the claudin-low tumor subtype with the lowest expression of genes involved in epithelial cell-cell adhesion (i.e., E-cadherin and claudins 3, 4 and 7), luminal differentiation (i.e., CD24, EpCAM) and high values for the CD44/CD24 and CD49f/EpCAM mRNA ratios (Figure S4, Table S3 in Additional file 1).
T3	ACCURATE 25555 25949	To complement these clustering analyses, we developed a claudin-low centroid- based predictor using the UNC337 tumor data set and the SigClust-defined claudin-low group versus all others, and objectively classified the 52 cell lines as claudin-low or not; as expected, the human tumor-based claudin-low predictor identified these nine cell lines as claudin-low (Figure S5 in Additional file 1).
