T2	Context 1860 2069	Context 130, a Basal-like context has under-expression of GATA3 which is in concordance with previous studies of Basal-like subgroup, ’claudin-low’ with poor prognosis and more refractory to chemotherapy [5] .
T3	ACCURATE 19939 20239	Compared to the luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like subtypes, claudin-low tumors showed inconsistent expression of basal keratins (keratins 5, 14 and 17) and low expression of HER2 and luminal markers such as ER, PR, GATA3, keratins 18 and 19 and the luminal gene cluster (Figure 1a).
