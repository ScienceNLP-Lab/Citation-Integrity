T1	Context 0 174	Recent advances in the field suggest that breast tumors belonging to the claudin-low and basal-like intrinsic subtypes are particularly enriched in TIC cell signatures [6,7].
T2	ACCURATE 4578 4715	Overall, these studies suggest that the claudin-low tumor subtype lacks common epithelial cell features and is enriched for TIC features.
T3	ACCURATE 50679 50969	A potential explanation for this similar scenario of basal-like and claudin-low tumors is that chemoresistant cells with TIC or mesenchymal properties are present at diagnosis in these two tumor subtypes as suggested by our immunofluorescence dual staining (Figure S9 in Additional file 1).
