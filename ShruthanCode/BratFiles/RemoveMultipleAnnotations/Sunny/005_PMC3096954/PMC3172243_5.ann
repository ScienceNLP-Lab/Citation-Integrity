T1	Context 0 161	Claudin-low carcinomas and representative cell lines are characterized by a down-regulation of epithelial junction proteins, such as cadherins and claudins [20].
T2	ACCURATE 3728 3973	These distinct tumors were found in both human and murine breast tumor data sets and were characterized by the low gene expression of tight junction proteins claudin 3, 4 and 7 and E-cadherin, a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein.
T3	ACCURATE 21384 21698	These findings, together with the low expression of epithelial cell-cell adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin, are consistent with an EMT (changes in cell phenotype between epithelial and mesenchymal states) [31] in claudin-low tumors and a potential recruitment of multiple types of leukocytes into these tumors.
