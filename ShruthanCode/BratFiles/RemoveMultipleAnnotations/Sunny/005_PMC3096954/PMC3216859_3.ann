T1	Context 688 906	However, when a gene list developed to classify the newly identified claudin-low subtype was used [27], we found that the cluster 1 samples were highly associated with the claudin-low gene expression profile (Table 2).
T4	Context 0 206	Both hierarchical clustering, SAM analysis and GSEA indicated that the expression in the cluster 1-biopsies resembled expression in stem-like cells and stromal cells (Table 2) (Additional file 3, Table S2).
T3	ACCURATE 2417 2645	Claudin-low tumors are characterized by the low to absent expression of luminal differentiation markers, high enrichment for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, immune response genes and cancer stem cell-like features.
T5	ACCURATE 48883 49102	Molecular characterization of the claudin-low subtype reveals that these tumors are significantly enriched in EMT and stem cell-like features while showing a low expression of luminal and proliferation-associated genes.
