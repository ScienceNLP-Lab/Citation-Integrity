T1	Context 425 593	Further analysis revealed that SAMHD1 blocks HIV-1 reverse transcription, as silencing SAMHD1 in THP-1 cells [9] and macrophages [10] increases the levels of viral DNA.
T2	ACCURATE 13874 14129	Quantification of viral reverse transcription intermediates showed that depleting SAMHD1 levels stimulated synthesis of viral full length cDNA by approximately 10-fold (Figure 4c), and again this effect was well pronounced even at the lowest doses of Vpx.
T4	ACCURATE 14130 14328	Specifically, it can be clearly seen that the “early” (“E”) vs. “late” (“L”) cDNA PCR readouts showed selective repression of “late” reverse transcription products at high but not low SAMHD1 levels.
T5	ACCURATE 14494 14642	This evidence clearly demonstrates that SAMHD1 inhibits MDM infection by HIV-1 and other primate lentiviruses by disrupting synthesis of viral cDNA.
