T1	Context 0 163	Our findings are in agreement with the recent reports of Laguette et al. [20] and Hrecka et al. [19] that identified SAMHD1 as a Vpx  and Vpx  interacting protein.
T3	Context 164 265	Taken together, these results demonstrate that Vpx targets SAMHD1 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.
T4	ACCURATE 1089 1229	Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1).
T5	ACCURATE 1230 1432	Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
