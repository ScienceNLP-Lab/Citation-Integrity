T2	Context 2316 2425	Two recent studies identified SAMHD1 as a cellular factor that is specifically bound and degraded by Vpx [59]
T3	ACCURATE 3984 4124	Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1).
T4	ACCURATE 4125 4327	Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
