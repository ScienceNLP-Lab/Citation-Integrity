T4	MultiCitation 166 170	[19]
T1	Context 15 170	we determine the role of SAMHD1 as a HIV-1 restriction factor in human monocytes confirming and extending the findings observed in other myeloid cells [19]
T2	ACCURATE 1775 1915	Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1).
T3	ACCURATE 1916 2118	Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
T5	ACCURATE 1019 1109	# Vpx relieves inhibition of HIV-1 infection of macrophages mediated by the SAMHD1 protein
