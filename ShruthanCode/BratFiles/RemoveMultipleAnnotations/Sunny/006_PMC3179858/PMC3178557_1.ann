T1	Context 1454 1705	Despite the fact that SAMHD1 is expressed in different cell types, it seems to restrict lentiviral infection specifically in myeloid cells, probably highlighting the need for a particular cellular context, or for specific cellular partners [59], [60].
T2	ACCURATE 2529 2669	Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1).
T3	ACCURATE 2670 2872	Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
T4	ACCURATE 15467 15615	This evidence clearly demonstrates that SAMHD1 inhibits MDM infection by HIV-1 and other primate lentiviruses by disrupting synthesis of viral cDNA.
T5	ACCURATE 18926 19184	Of note, we observed that SAMHD1 levels are depleted by Vpx in both MDM and monocyte- derived dendritic cells in a Vpx glutamine Q76 dependent manner (data not shown) implicating SAMHD1 as the key AGS protein inhibiting lentivirus infection in myeloid cells.
