T1	Context 0 112	SAMHD1-mediated HIV-1 restriction has so far been analyzed only in monocyte-derived DCs [9] and macrophages [10]
T2	ACCURATE 1410 1550	Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1).
T3	ACCURATE 1551 1753	Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
T4	ACCURATE 2075 2374	Thus, our findings reveal that macrophages are defended from HIV-1 infection by a mechanism that prevents an unwanted interferon response triggered by self nucleic acids, and uncover an intricate relationship between innate immune mechanisms that control response to self and to retroviral pathogens
