T1	Context 0 179	By contrast, Hrecka and colleagues identified SAMHD1 from HEK 293T cells expressing tagged Vpx in a proteomic screen using multidimensional protein identification technology [10].
T2	ACCURATE 6126 6351	All protein complexes were purified by two sequential immunoprecipitations of epitope tags, under native conditions, and their subunit composition was analyzed by Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT)18.
T3	ACCURATE 5188 5340	Specifically, we directed the assembly of three sets of protein complexes in HEK 293T cells for their subsequent proteomic characterization (Figure 2a).
T4	ACCURATE 7280 7569	The most abundant of the candidate proteins uncovered in this screen was the innate immune SAM-domain HD-domain containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), which co- purified with both Vpx (6 spectra) and Vpx-CRL4DCAF1 complex (37 spectra), but not with CRL4DCAF1 complex alone (Supplementary Table I).
