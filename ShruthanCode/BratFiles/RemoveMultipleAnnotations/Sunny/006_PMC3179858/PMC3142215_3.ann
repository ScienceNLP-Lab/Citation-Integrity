T1	Context 388 589	Both studies confirmed that Vpx interacts with SAMHD1 and induces proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1 in THP-1 cells or macrophages, which can be restored by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor [9,10].
T3	ACCURATE 1554 1756	Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
T4	ACCURATE 17261 17481	SAMHD1 is expressed in HEK 293T cells, undifferentiated THP-1 cells and other non-myeloid cell types that do not possess a Vpx-sensitive mechanism restricting primate lentivirus infection (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7).
T5	ACCURATE 9995 10168	Importantly, the effect of Vpx was blocked when macrophages were exposed to the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prior to and during infection with Vpx-loaded SIV VLP (Figure 3b).
