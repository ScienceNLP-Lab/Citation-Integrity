T2	Context 1004 1239	SAMHD1 [158], like the exonuclease TREX1 [160] may be responsible for innate sensing of viral DNA, and viral targeting of SAMHD1 may possibly contribute to viral innate immune evasion, although this has not been specifically addressed.
T4	INDIRECT 8397 8581	Interestingly, SAMHD1 mutations are associated with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS), an autoimmune disease caused by an abnormal innate immune response to endogenous nucleic acids7,8.
T5	INDIRECT 17548 17793	Recent studies of TREX1 suggest that it plays a role in the control of retrotransposon and endogenous retroviral elements, and in inhibiting the innate immune response to HIV-1 DNA in T cells and macrophages by clearing excess of viral cDNA9,24.
T7	INDIRECT 17434 17547	Notably, in addition to SAMHD1, two nucleases TREX1 and RNAse H2 have been linked to Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome8.
