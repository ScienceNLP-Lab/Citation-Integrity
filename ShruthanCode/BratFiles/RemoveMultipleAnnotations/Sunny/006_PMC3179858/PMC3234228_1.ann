T1	Context 342 563	Two recent publications identified Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) Domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) as the Vpx-sensitive restriction factor that inhibits HIV-1 infection of macrophages and dendritic cells [19]
T2	ACCURATE 1394 1534	Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1).
T3	ACCURATE 1535 1737	Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
