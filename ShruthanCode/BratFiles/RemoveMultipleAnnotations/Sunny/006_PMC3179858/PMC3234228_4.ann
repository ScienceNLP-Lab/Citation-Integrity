T1	Context 563 771	We conclude that monocytes express SAMHD1 as an interferon-inducible factor (Figure 2E) that is degraded upon Vpx-supported HIV-1 infection confirming the results in dendritic cells [20] and macrophages [19].
T2	ACCURATE 1595 1735	Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1).
T4	ACCURATE 1736 1938	Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
