T1	Context 2432 2558	Contrarily to A3A, SAMHD1 is expressed in cells other than myeloid cells, as its isolation from HEK 293T cells indicates [59].
T3	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 12022 12193	Because SAMHD1 was originally identified in HEK 293T cells, it was important to confirm that it is both expressed and targeted by Vpx for degradation via CRL4DCAF1 in MDM.
T5	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 20053 20159	One possible explanation is that SAMHD1-mediated restriction may require a myeloid cell-specific molecule.
