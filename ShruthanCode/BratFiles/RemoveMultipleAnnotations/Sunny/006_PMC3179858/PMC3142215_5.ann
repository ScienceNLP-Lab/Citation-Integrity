T1	Context 594 720	Together, these studies suggested that SAMHD1 is the myeloid-cell specific HIV-1 restriction factor counteracted by Vpx [9,10]
T2	ACCURATE 1697 1899	Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
T3	ACCURATE 1556 1696	Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1).
