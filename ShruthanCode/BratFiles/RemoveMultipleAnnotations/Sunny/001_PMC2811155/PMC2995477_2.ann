T3	Context 625 664	several studies suggest a role of PINK1
T4	ACCURATE 2453 2687	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps.
T5	ACCURATE 7406 7699	Here, we show that full-length PINK1 accumulates selectively on dysfunctional mitochondria, and that Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria and subsequent Parkin-induced mitophagy are strictly dependent on PINK1's mitochondrial targeting signal and depolarization-induced accumulation.
T6	ACCURATE 31807 31934	These results suggest that PINK1 is necessary for the mitophagy of depolarized mitochondria following overexpression of Parkin.
