T1	Context 0 183	Several studies reported that mitochondrial stress, such as exposure to membrane potential inhibitors, initiates the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway [14], [15], [16], [17], [20], [28].
T3	ACCURATE 7401 7595	In this model, mitochondrial PINK1 is rapidly turned over on bioenergetically well-coupled mitochondria by proteolysis, but is selectively stabilized on mitochondria with low membrane potential.
T4	ACCURATE 7596 7747	Selective accumulation of PINK1 on the impaired mitochondria recruits Parkin, and Parkin, in turn, induces the degradation of the damaged mitochondria.
T5	ACCURATE 8487 8604	Remarkably, levels of endogenous mitochondrial PINK1 respond robustly to changes in mitochondrial membrane potential.
T6	ACCURATE 7748 7887	In this model, PINK1 and Parkin form a pathway for sensing and selectively eliminating damaged mitochondria from the mitochondrial network.
T7	ACCURATE 6976 7269	Here, we show that full-length PINK1 accumulates selectively on dysfunctional mitochondria, and that Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria and subsequent Parkin-induced mitophagy are strictly dependent on PINK1's mitochondrial targeting signal and depolarization-induced accumulation.
