T1	Context 1223 1396	These results suggest that in contrast to FL, the CCCP-stabilized form of PINK1 that localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane facing the cytosol (Narendra et al., 2010)
T2	ACCURATE 16688 16814	### PINK1 Cleavage Is Inhibited by Loss of Membrane Potential, Leading to Its Accumulation on the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane
T3	ACCURATE 17309 17476	To test whether PINK1 accumulation following CCCP treatment is due to inhibition of its proteolytic cleavage, we assessed the effect of CCCP washout on PINK1 cleavage.
T4	ACCURATE 22055 22266	Consistent with results from a recent study of PINK1's topology when it is ectopically expressed [22], we found that the kinase domain of endogenous PINK1 faces the cytosol following depolarization (Figure S1E).
