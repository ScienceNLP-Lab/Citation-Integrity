T1	Context 684 915	whereas ectopic and endogenous PINK1 have been reported to span the outer mitochondrial membrane with the C-terminal kinase region facing the cytosol poised to induce Parkin translocation (Zhou et al., 2008; Narendra et al., 2010).
T3	ACCURATE 56484 56761	In addition, increased expression of PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane is sufficient for Parkin recruitment and Parkin-induced mitophagy, suggesting that loss of membrane potential activates Parkin recruitment primarily through the up-regulation of mitochondrial PINK1.
T4	ACCURATE 41580 41775	We found that FRB-PINK1Î”1-110-YFP is in the cytosol in the absence of AP21967, but is quickly recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane following the addition of AP21967 (Figure S4B and S4C).
T5	ACCURATE 22316 22526	Consistent with results from a recent study of PINK1's topology when it is ectopically expressed [22], we found that the kinase domain of endogenous PINK1 faces the cytosol following depolarization (Figure S1E)
