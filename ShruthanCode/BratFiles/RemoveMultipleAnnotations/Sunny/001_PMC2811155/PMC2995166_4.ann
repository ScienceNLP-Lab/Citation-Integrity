T1	Context 1158 1531	This contrasts with our previous work using short hairpin RNAi targeting a different site in PARL mRNA that was interpreted to exclude PARL as a protease for PINK1 cleavage, likely owing to insufficient knockdown of endogenous PARL in HeLa cells and to insufficient expression of ectopic PINK1 in PARL knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; Narendra et al., 2010)
T2	ACCURATE 23678 23754	Together, these results suggest that PARL is dispensable for PINK1 cleavage.
T4	ACCURATE 23219 23356	Although endogenous PARL could not be detected in HeLa cells, PARL shRNA inhibited expression of overexpressed PARL (Figure S2A and S2B).
T5	ACCURATE 14087 14334	To examine the selectivity of PINK1 accumulation on uncoupled mitochondria within single cells, we first investigated its expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) null for mitochondrial fusion proteins mitofusin-1 and mitofusin-2 (Mfn1/2).
T6	ACCURATE 14491 14776	We found that, similar to YFP-Parkin [21], PINK1-YFP accumulates selectively on mitochondria with low membrane potential, demonstrating that PINK1 is selectively stabilized on the depolarized mitochondria within a bioenergetically diverse population of mitochondria (Figure 1E and 1F).
T7	ACCURATE 23357 23533	Knockdown of PARL did not appreciably change basal levels of endogenous PINK1 or augment the depolarization-induced accumulation of endogenous PINK1 in HeLa cells (Figure S2B).
