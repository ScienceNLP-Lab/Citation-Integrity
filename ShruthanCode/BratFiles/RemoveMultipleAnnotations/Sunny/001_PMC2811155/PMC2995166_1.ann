T3	Context 519 825	Upon mitochondrial damage or uncoupling, Parkin relocalizes to mitochondria and can mediate the autophagic elimination of damaged mitochondria (Narendra et al., 2008), which is dependent on PINK1 kinase activity (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010; Vives-Bauza et al., 2010).
T4	ACCURATE 1726 1959	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps
T5	ACCURATE 1961 2088	These findings provide a biochemical explanation for the genetic epistasis between PINK1 and Parkin in Drosophila melanogaster.
T6	ACCURATE 2089 2279	In addition, they support a novel model for the negative selection of damaged mitochondria, in which PINK1 signals mitochondrial dysfunction to Parkin, and Parkin promotes their elimination.
T7	ACCURATE 5210 5336	Recent studies have linked Parkin and PINK1 in a pathway critical for the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and function.
