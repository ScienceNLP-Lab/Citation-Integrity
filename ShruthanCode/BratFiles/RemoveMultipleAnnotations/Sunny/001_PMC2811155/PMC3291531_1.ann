T1	Context 217 400	We first used HeLa cells to test whether Miro protein level might be regulated by PINK1 and possibly Parkin, which tends to work together with PINK1 in a common pathway [3]â€“[5], [39].
T2	ACCURATE 3494 3684	In addition, they support a novel model for the negative selection of damaged mitochondria, in which PINK1 signals mitochondrial dysfunction to Parkin, and Parkin promotes their elimination.
T3	ACCURATE 4304 4471	The findings we report in this paper suggest a new model in which PINK1 and Parkin together sense mitochondria in distress and selectively target them for degradation.
T4	ACCURATE 3944 4208	Previous studies in flies and mice, and in human cells suggest that PINK1 and Parkin are part of a common pathway that protects against damaged mitochondria; these organelles power the cell when healthy but can produce harmful reactive oxygen species when damaged.
