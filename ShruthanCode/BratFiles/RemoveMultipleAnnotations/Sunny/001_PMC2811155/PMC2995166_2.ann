T2	Context 62 382	Although endogenous PINK1 protein expression is constitutively low owing to rapid turnover, PINK1 proteolysis is inhibited by mitochondrial uncoupling, allowing a robust increase in expression when a mitochondrion is damaged and loses membrane potential (Lin and Kang, 2008; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010).
T3	ACCURATE 44262 44359	This is consistent with the absence of PINK1 mRNA up-regulation following uncoupling (Figure 2C).
T4	ACCURATE 2255 2523	Here, we show that expression of PINK1 on individual mitochondria is regulated by voltage- dependent proteolysis to maintain low levels of PINK1 on healthy, polarized mitochondria, while facilitating the rapid accumulation of PINK1 on mitochondria that sustain damage.
T5	ACCURATE 55824 55928	Here, we show that PINK1 selectively accumulates on depolarized mitochondria that have sustained damage.
T6	ACCURATE 56156 56326	On damaged mitochondria that have lost their membrane potential, however, PINK1 cleavage is inhibited, leading to high PINK1 expression on the dysfunctional mitochondria.
