T2	Context 310 432	Apparently, a deficit in mitophagy leads to accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in the cell [14], [15], [16], [17].
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 1080 1205	Loss-of-function mutations in PINK1 and Parkin cause parkinsonism in humans and mitochondrial dysfunction in model organisms.
T4	OVERSIMPLIFY 1206 1306	Parkin is selectively recruited from the cytosol to damaged mitochondria to trigger their autophagy.
T5	OVERSIMPLIFY 1641 1875	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps.
T6	OVERSIMPLIFY 2004 2194	In addition, they support a novel model for the negative selection of damaged mitochondria, in which PINK1 signals mitochondrial dysfunction to Parkin, and Parkin promotes their elimination.
