T2	Context 744 944	A decline in mitochondrial membrane-potential induced by the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was reported to activate the PINK1/Parkin pathway [13], [14], [39].
T3	ACCURATE 9713 9957	When HeLa cells are treated with CCCP, which depolarizes mitochondria by increasing membrane permeability to H+, a large increase in endogenous full-length PINK1 (âˆ¼63 kDa) is seen beginning by 30 min and continuing for at least 3 h (Figure 1A).
T4	ACCURATE 9595 9712	Remarkably, levels of endogenous mitochondrial PINK1 respond robustly to changes in mitochondrial membrane potential.
T5	ACCURATE 8084 8377	Here, we show that full-length PINK1 accumulates selectively on dysfunctional mitochondria, and that Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria and subsequent Parkin-induced mitophagy are strictly dependent on PINK1's mitochondrial targeting signal and depolarization-induced accumulation.
