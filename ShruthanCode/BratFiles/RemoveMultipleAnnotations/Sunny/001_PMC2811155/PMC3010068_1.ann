T1	Context 365 619	Consistent with genetic studies in flies that indicated that they work in the same pathway, Parkin translocation and mitophagy induction require PINK1 activity (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010; Vives-Bauza et al., 2010).
T2	ACCURATE 1684 1918	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps.
T3	ACCURATE 6637 6930	Here, we show that full-length PINK1 accumulates selectively on dysfunctional mitochondria, and that Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria and subsequent Parkin-induced mitophagy are strictly dependent on PINK1's mitochondrial targeting signal and depolarization-induced accumulation.
T4	ACCURATE 31038 31165	These results suggest that PINK1 is necessary for the mitophagy of depolarized mitochondria following overexpression of Parkin.
T5	ACCURATE 32709 32804	These data suggest that PINK1 promotes mitophagy in the context of endogenous levels of Parkin.
