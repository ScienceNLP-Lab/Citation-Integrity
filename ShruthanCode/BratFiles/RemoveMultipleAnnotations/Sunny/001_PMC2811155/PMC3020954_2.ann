T2	Context 831 956	n turn, Parkin promotes the degradation of functionally impaired mitochondria through ubiquitination-dependent autophagy [11]
T3	ACCURATE 4785 4885	Parkin is selectively recruited from the cytosol to damaged mitochondria to trigger their autophagy.
T4	ACCURATE 58009 58390	We recently reported that the Parkinson disease-linked E3 ubiquitin ligase, Parkin, is selectively recruited to dysfunctional mitochondria with low membrane potential to promote their autophagic degradation, suggesting that a deficiency of mitochondrial quality control may underlie the observed mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkin knockout Drosophila and mice [11]â€“[15],[17],[21].
T5	ACCURATE 9755 9933	We recently reported that Parkin is selectively recruited to dysfunctional mitochondria with low membrane potential and, subsequently, promotes their autophagic degradation [21].
