T1	Context 365 492	These observations, together with the finding that the normally labile PINK1 protein is stabilized on damaged mitochondria [39]
T3	ACCURATE 2907 3175	Here, we show that expression of PINK1 on individual mitochondria is regulated by voltage- dependent proteolysis to maintain low levels of PINK1 on healthy, polarized mitochondria, while facilitating the rapid accumulation of PINK1 on mitochondria that sustain damage.
T4	ACCURATE 8554 8748	In this model, mitochondrial PINK1 is rapidly turned over on bioenergetically well-coupled mitochondria by proteolysis, but is selectively stabilized on mitochondria with low membrane potential.
T5	ACCURATE 8749 8900	Selective accumulation of PINK1 on the impaired mitochondria recruits Parkin, and Parkin, in turn, induces the degradation of the damaged mitochondria.
