T1	Context 0 186	We have previously shown that experimentally stabilized PINK1 on the mitochondrial outer membrane recruits Parkin even in the absence of mitochondrial uncoupling (Narendra et al., 2010).
T2	ACCURATE 1444 1678	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps.
T3	ACCURATE 7555 7773	Parkin is selectively recruited to damaged mitochondria that have lost their membrane potential, but how Parkin distinguishes dysfunctional mitochondria with low membrane potential from healthy mitochondria is unknown.
T4	ACCURATE 24182 24479	YFP-Parkin recruitment could be reconstituted in PINK1−/− MEFs by expression of wild-type PINK1, but not by PINK1 ΔN lacking its mitochondrial targeting N-terminus (1–155) [22], suggesting that mitochondrial targeting of PINK1 is required for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria (Figure 3A and 3B).
