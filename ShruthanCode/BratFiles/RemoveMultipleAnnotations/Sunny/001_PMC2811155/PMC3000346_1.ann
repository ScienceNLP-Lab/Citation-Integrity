T1	Context 0 115	PINK1 and Parkin have also been suggested to collaborate to form a mitochondrial quality control system [11], [12].
T2	ACCURATE 1910 2100	In addition, they support a novel model for the negative selection of damaged mitochondria, in which PINK1 signals mitochondrial dysfunction to Parkin, and Parkin promotes their elimination.
T3	ACCURATE 2720 2887	The findings we report in this paper suggest a new model in which PINK1 and Parkin together sense mitochondria in distress and selectively target them for degradation.
T4	ACCURATE 2888 3047	In this pathway, PINK1 acts as a flag that accumulates on dysfunctional mitochondria and then signals to Parkin, which tags these mitochondria for destruction.
