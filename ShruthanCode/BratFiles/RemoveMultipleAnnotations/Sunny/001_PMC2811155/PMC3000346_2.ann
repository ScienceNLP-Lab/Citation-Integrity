T2	Context 265 391	This translocation of Parkin requires the function of PINK1, which is stabilized and accumulates on damaged mitochondria [12].
T3	ACCURATE 32913 33190	Consistent with genetic studies in Drosophila, these findings show that Parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria and Parkin-induced mitophagy are downstream of PINK1 expression, whereas PINK1 accumulation in response to depolarization is upstream of Parkin recruitment.
T4	ACCURATE 1547 1781	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps.
T5	ACCURATE 2888 3047	In this pathway, PINK1 acts as a flag that accumulates on dysfunctional mitochondria and then signals to Parkin, which tags these mitochondria for destruction.
