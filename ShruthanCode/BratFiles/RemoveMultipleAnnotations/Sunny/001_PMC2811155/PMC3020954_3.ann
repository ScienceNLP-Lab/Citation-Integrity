T1	Context 2259 2368	Because PINK1 kinase activity is required for many Parkin functions and Parkin acts downstream of PINK1 [11],
T3	ACCURATE 34706 34982	Consistent with genetic studies in Drosophila, these findings show that Parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria and Parkin-induced mitophagy are downstream of PINK1 expression, whereas PINK1 accumulation in response to depolarization is upstream of Parkin recruitment
T4	ACCURATE 3340 3574	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps.
T5	ACCURATE 3703 3893	In addition, they support a novel model for the negative selection of damaged mitochondria, in which PINK1 signals mitochondrial dysfunction to Parkin, and Parkin promotes their elimination.
T6	ACCURATE 8293 8586	Here, we show that full-length PINK1 accumulates selectively on dysfunctional mitochondria, and that Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria and subsequent Parkin-induced mitophagy are strictly dependent on PINK1's mitochondrial targeting signal and depolarization-induced accumulation.
