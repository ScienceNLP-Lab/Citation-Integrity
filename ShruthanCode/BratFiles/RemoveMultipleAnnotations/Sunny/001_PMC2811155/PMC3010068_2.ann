T2	Context 536 759	To achieve this, we applied two Parkin mutants: ParkinR275W, which translocates to depolarized mitochondria but fails to induce mitophagy; and ParkinC441R, which fails to translocate to mitochondria (Narendra et al., 2010).
T4	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 51587 51826	Mitochondrial recruitment was seen for several of the conserved cysteine RING mutants (C289G, C332S, and C441R) after 24 h of CCCP exposure, suggesting that recruitment is not completely disrupted with these mutations (Figure S8A and S8B).
