T1	Context 449 546	M17 neuroblastoma carrying small hairpin RNA (shRNA) for control or PINK1 (Narendra et al., 2010)
T2	ACCURATE 12048 12220	To verify that the âˆ¼63-kDa band is in fact PINK1, we immunoblotted for endogenous PINK1 in M17 cells stably transduced with control short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or PINK shRNA.
T3	ACCURATE 31671 32009	To test whether PINK1 expression affects mitochondrial turnover in the presence of endogenous levels of Parkin, we treated the control shRNA and PINK1 shRNA M17 cells (which express moderate levels of Parkin) with DMSO or CCCP for 24 h and measured their relative mitochondrial mass by Mitotracker Green (MTG) staining and flow cytometry.
