T1	Context 0 237	The effect of the microbiome on atherosclerosis, glucose homeostasis and adiposity has been attributed, in part, to circulating metabolites such as trimethylamine-oxide and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut bacteria2345720.
T3	ACCURATE 3972 4158	Choline, a trimethylamine and part of the head group of phosphatidylcholine, is metabolized by gut microbiota to produce an intermediate compound known as trimethylamine (TMA) (Fig. 1a).
T4	ACCURATE 4159 4262	TMA is rapidly further oxidized by hepatic flavin monooxygenases to form trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO).
T5	ACCURATE 4360 4547	These findings raise the possibility that other dietary nutrients possessing a trimethylamine structure may also generate TMAO from gut microbiota and promote accelerated atherosclerosis.
T6	ACCURATE 1428 1602	Herein we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota metabolism of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis.
