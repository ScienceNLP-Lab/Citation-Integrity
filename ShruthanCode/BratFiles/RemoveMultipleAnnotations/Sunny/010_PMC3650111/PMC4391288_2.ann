T1	MultiCitation 146 148	12
T2	Context 0 154	Over the past 4 years, FMO3 and TMAO have emerged as key components of a complex axis integrating diet and the gut microbiome with atherosclerosis12132136
T3	ACCURATE 1217 1391	Herein we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota metabolism of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis.
T4	ACCURATE 1392 1557	Omnivorous subjects are shown to produce significantly more TMAO than vegans/vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism.
T5	ACCURATE 4149 4335	These findings raise the possibility that other dietary nutrients possessing a trimethylamine structure may also generate TMAO from gut microbiota and promote accelerated atherosclerosis
