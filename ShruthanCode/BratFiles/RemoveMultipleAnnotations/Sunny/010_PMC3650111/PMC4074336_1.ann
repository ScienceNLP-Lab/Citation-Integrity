T1	Context 505 650	Additional, recent mouse studies [145] investigating how consumption of red meat may accelerate cardiovascular disease and inflammation in humans
T2	ACCURATE 35463 35655	Taken together, these data show that gut-microbiota dependent metabolite TMAO fosters alterations in a major pathway for cholesterol elimination from the body, the bile acid synthetic pathway.
T3	ACCURATE 34077 34426	In parallel studies, we examined the expression levels of known cholesterol transporters (i.e. Srb1, Abca1, Abcg1, ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G, member 5 (Abcg5), ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G, member 8 (Abcg8), and nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 (Shp)) within mouse liver between the normal chow vs. TMAO dietary groups.
T4	ACCURATE 36278 36417	In separate studies, dietary TMAO supplementation similarly promoted a reduction (26%, P < 0.01) in total cholesterol absorption (Fig. 6b).
T5	ACCURATE 38426 38539	Meats and full fat dairy products are abundant components of the Western diet and are commonly implicated in CVD.
T6	ACCURATE 39108 39311	The present studies suggest reduction in carnitine and total choline ingestion with attendant reductions in TMAO levels may contribute to the cardiovascular health benefits observed in vegan/vegetarians.
