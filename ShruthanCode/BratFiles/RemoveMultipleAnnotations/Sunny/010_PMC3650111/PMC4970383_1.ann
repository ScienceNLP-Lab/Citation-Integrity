T1	Context 1101 1270	In the liver, TMA is oxidized into trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) (499), a small molecule strongly associated with promoting inflammatory-based atherosclerosis (500, 501)
T2	ACCURATE 1751 1934	Intestinal microbiota metabolism of choline/phosphatidylcholine produces trimethylamine (TMA), which is further metabolized to a proatherogenic species, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO).
T3	ACCURATE 1935 2109	Herein we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota metabolism of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis.
T4	ACCURATE 2657 2887	Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice significantly altered cecal microbial composition, markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA/TMAO, and increased atherosclerosis, but not following suppression of intestinal microbiota.
