T2	Context 748 1022	Dietary L-carnitine and choline, compounds abundant in red meat, are metabolized into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by way of some normal gut commensals; in mice TMAO enhances atherosclerosis through disrupting cholesterol metabolism and foam-cell macrophage activity [145].
T3	ACCURATE 40189 40330	Another pro- atherosclerotic mechanism of TMAO is increases in macrophage SRA and CD36 surface expression and foam cell formation9 (Fig. 6c).
T4	ACCURATE 43284 43492	The differences observed in TMAO production following an “L-carnitine challenge” within omnivore versus vegan subjects is striking, consistent with the observed differences in microbial community composition.
T5	ACCURATE 3116 3346	Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice significantly altered cecal microbial composition, markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA/TMAO, and increased atherosclerosis, but not following suppression of intestinal microbiota.
