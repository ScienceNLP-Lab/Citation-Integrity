T1	Context 0 232	While higher plasma levels of  -carnitine, in association with TMAO, are positively correlated with cardiovascular events in humans, intriguingly, omnivores produce more TMAO from dietary  -carnitine than vegans or vegetarians (501)
T3	ACCURATE 43260 43532	Of note, we observed a significant increase in baseline plasma TMAO concentrations in what historically was called enterotype 2 (Prevotella) (P < 0.05), a relatively rare enterotype that previously in one study was associated with low animal fat and protein consumption18.
T4	ACCURATE 42425 42564	Microbial composition analyses from humans and mice revealed specific taxa that segregated with both dietary status and plasma TMAO levels.
T5	ACCURATE 42930 43138	The differences observed in TMAO production following an “L-carnitine challenge” within omnivore versus vegan subjects is striking, consistent with the observed differences in microbial community composition.
T6	ACCURATE 42179 42424	A remarkable finding of the present studies is the magnitude with which long term dietary habits impact TMAO synthetic capacity in both humans (i.e. vegan and vegetarian vs. omnivore) and mice (normal chow vs. chronic carnitine supplementation).
