T1	Context 238 445	In both humans and mice, TMAO concentrations correlate positively with CVD risk, and dietary supplementation with either TMAO or compounds that can be metabolized to TMAO increases atherosclerosis in mice12.
T2	CONTRADICT 2228 2395	Dietary supplementation of TMAO, or either carnitine or choline in mice with intact intestinal microbiota, significantly reduced reverse cholesterol transport in vivo.
T3	CONTRADICT 31520 31830	Further examination of plasma, liver and bile compartments in the normal chow versus TMAO supplemented mice demonstrated significant reductions in [14C]cholesterol recovered within plasma of the TMAO fed mice (16%, P < 0.05), but no changes in counts recovered within the liver or bile (Supplementary Fig. 17).
