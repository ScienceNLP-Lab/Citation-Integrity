T1	Context 2296 2581	Interestingly, Prevotella-dominated healthy omnivore individuals were recently reported to have increased basal levels of serum TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide), a product of inflammation linked to atherogenesis, compared to Bacteroides-dominated healthy individuals (Koeth et al., 2013).
T2	ACCURATE 18058 18408	When subjects were classified into previously reported enterotypes18 based upon fecal microbial composition, individuals with an enterotype characterized by enriched proportions of the genus Prevotella (n=4) demonstrated higher (p<0.05) plasma TMAO levels than subjects with an enterotype notable for enrichment of Bacteroides (n=49) genus (Fig. 2e).
T3	ACCURATE 44486 44758	Of note, we observed a significant increase in baseline plasma TMAO concentrations in what historically was called enterotype 2 (Prevotella) (P < 0.05), a relatively rare enterotype that previously in one study was associated with low animal fat and protein consumption18.
T4	ACCURATE 3266 3440	Herein we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota metabolism of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis.
T5	ACCURATE 48441 48712	Our results suggest the safety of chronic L-carnitine supplementation should be examined, because high amounts of orally ingested carnitine may under some conditions prime our gut microbiota with enhanced capacity to produce TMAO, and potentially promote atherosclerosis.
T6	ACCURATE 6101 6197	TMAO was subsequently shown to be both proatherogenic and associated with cardiovascular risks.9
