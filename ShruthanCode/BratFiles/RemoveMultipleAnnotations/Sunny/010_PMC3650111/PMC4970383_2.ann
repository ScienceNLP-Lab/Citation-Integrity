T2	Context 1414 1568	In apoliprotein E-deficient mice fed a diet with  -carnitine, the promotion of atherosclerosis was also mediated by a microbiota-dependent mechanism (501)
T3	ACCURATE 2110 2275	Omnivorous subjects are shown to produce significantly more TMAO than vegans/vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism.
T4	ACCURATE 2657 2887	Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice significantly altered cecal microbial composition, markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA/TMAO, and increased atherosclerosis, but not following suppression of intestinal microbiota.
T5	ACCURATE 2888 3055	Dietary supplementation of TMAO, or either carnitine or choline in mice with intact intestinal microbiota, significantly reduced reverse cholesterol transport in vivo.
T6	ACCURATE 4867 5054	These findings raise the possibility that other dietary nutrients possessing a trimethylamine structure may also generate TMAO from gut microbiota and promote accelerated atherosclerosis.
T7	ACCURATE 12085 12209	Collectively, these data show that TMAO production from dietary L-carnitine in humans is dependent on intestinal microbiota.
