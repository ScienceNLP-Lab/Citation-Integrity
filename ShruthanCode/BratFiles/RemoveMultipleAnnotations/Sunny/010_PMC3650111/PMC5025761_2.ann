T2	Context 312 481	Metabolites of dietary phospholipids and nutrients produced by gut flora and found in the systemic circulation contribute to vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis35.
T3	ACCURATE 3639 3825	Choline, a trimethylamine and part of the head group of phosphatidylcholine, is metabolized by gut microbiota to produce an intermediate compound known as trimethylamine (TMA) (Fig. 1a).
T4	ACCURATE 4027 4214	These findings raise the possibility that other dietary nutrients possessing a trimethylamine structure may also generate TMAO from gut microbiota and promote accelerated atherosclerosis.
T5	ACCURATE 6510 6516	Herein
T6	ACCURATE 17662 17792	Collectively, these studies confirm in mice an obligatory role for gut microbiota in TMA/TMAO production from dietary L-carnitine.
