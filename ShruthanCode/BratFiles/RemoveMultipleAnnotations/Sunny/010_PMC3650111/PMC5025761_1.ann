T1	Context 217 311	The microbiome can also contribute to the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease3456.
T2	ACCURATE 2216 2340	Intestinal microbiota may thus participate in the well-established link between increased red meat consumption and CVD risk.
T3	ACCURATE 4027 4214	These findings raise the possibility that other dietary nutrients possessing a trimethylamine structure may also generate TMAO from gut microbiota and promote accelerated atherosclerosis.
T4	ACCURATE 1095 1269	Herein we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota metabolism of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis.
T5	ACCURATE 3487 3638	We recently reported a novel pathway in both humans and mice linking microbiota metabolism of dietary choline/phosphatidylcholine to CVD pathogenesis9.
