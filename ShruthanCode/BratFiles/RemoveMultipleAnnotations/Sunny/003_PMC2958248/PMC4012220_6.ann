T2	Context 1170 1261	hat HIV not only exploits many host factors for the successful completion of the life cycle
T3	ACCURATE 1649 1732	Viral infection triggers innate immune sensors to produce type I interferons (IFN).
T4	ACCURATE 1556 1634	# The cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 inhibits the innate immune response to HIV-1
T6	ACCURATE 1870 1934	The cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 suppressed IFN triggered by HIV.
T7	ACCURATE 2162 2313	TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway.
