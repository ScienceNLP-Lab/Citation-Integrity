T1	Context 990 1209	Consequently, overall HIV-1 replication in which TREX1 expression is suppressed or ablated is reduced compared replication in normal cells, because DNA sensing results in expression of antiviral IFNs (Yan et al., 2010).
T2	ACCURATE 2415 2498	Viral infection triggers innate immune sensors to produce type I interferons (IFN).
T3	ACCURATE 2577 2635	How HIV avoids activating nucleic acid sensors is unknown.
T4	ACCURATE 2636 2700	The cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 suppressed IFN triggered by HIV.
T5	ACCURATE 2928 3079	TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway.
