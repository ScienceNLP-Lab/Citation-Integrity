T1	Context 1072 1211	Since only a few copies of HIV DNA integrate, the bulk of HIV DNA remains in the cytosol unless cleared by host enzymes (Yan et al., 2010).
T2	ACCURATE 2400 2501	Few copies of HIV DNA integrate, leaving behind HIV DNA in the cytosol to be cleared by host enzymes.
T3	ACCURATE 36911 37079	At an MOI of 1, HIV infection produces many reverse transcripts (although only one per incoming gRNA), but very few copies manage to integrate into the host chromosome.
T4	ACCURATE 37080 37266	The remaining HIV DNA is cleared by TREX1, since cytosolic HIV DNA builds up when TREX1 function is deficient or inhibited and can be removed by expression of enzymatically active TREX1.
