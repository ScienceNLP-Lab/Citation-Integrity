T2	Context 0 198	For our ssDNA and dsDNA stimulation experiments (Fig. 4d), mDCs from either HDs (n = 8) or ECs (n = 7) were cultured for 24 h in the presence of Poly I:C and 2 μg/mL of either ss- or ds-Gag DNA [41]
T3	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 15686 15894	To determine whether transfected oligonucleotides accumulate in Trex1−/− cells as HIV DNA does during infection, we quantified cytosolic DNA after transfection of gag sequence ssDNA or dsDNA or HIV infection.
