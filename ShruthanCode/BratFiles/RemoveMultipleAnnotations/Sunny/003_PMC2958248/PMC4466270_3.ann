T3	ACCURATE 38778 38921	HIV integrase binds to the ends of reverse transcripts that are capable of chromosomal integration and might protect them from TREX1 digestion.
T4	ACCURATE 38922 39036	Incomplete RT products, however, would not bind integrase and therefore would be susceptible to TREX1 degradation.
T5	ACCURATE 17768 17864	These results strongly suggest that TREX1 suppresses IFN-Î² induction by digesting cytosolic DNA.
T6	ACCURATE 16609 16797	Although synthetic oligonucleotides may not completely mimic native HIV RT products, these data are consistent with the known enzymatic preference of TREX1 for ssDNA vs dsDNA substrates15.
