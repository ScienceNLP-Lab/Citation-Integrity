T2	Context 2039 2242	It was demonstrated that in the absence of TREX1, a type I IFN response is induced that inhibits HIV replication and spreading, although the specific DNA sensor responsible remains to be identified [36].
T3	ACCURATE 2611 2694	Viral infection triggers innate immune sensors to produce type I interferons (IFN).
T4	ACCURATE 2832 2896	The cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 suppressed IFN triggered by HIV.
T5	ACCURATE 2518 2596	# The cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 inhibits the innate immune response to HIV-1
T6	ACCURATE 32003 32073	Based on siRNA experiments, none of the known DNA sensors is involved.
