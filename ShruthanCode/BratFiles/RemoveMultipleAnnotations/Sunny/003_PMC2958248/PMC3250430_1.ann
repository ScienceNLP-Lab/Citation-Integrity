T1	Context 1842 2038	More recently, Lieberman and associates presented evidence that the cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 inhibits the innate immune response to HIV by degrading ssDNA derived from integrated provirus [36].
T2	ACCURATE 19063 19177	TREX1 metabolizes reverse-transcribed HIV DNA and transfected ssDNA and dsDNA in both mouse and human fibroblasts.
T3	ACCURATE 2518 2596	# The cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 inhibits the innate immune response to HIV-1
T4	ACCURATE 31291 31486	We showed here that the host cytoplasmic exonuclease TREX1 helps HIV evade innate immunity by digesting reverse transcripts that are not imported into the nucleus and would otherwise induce IFNs.
