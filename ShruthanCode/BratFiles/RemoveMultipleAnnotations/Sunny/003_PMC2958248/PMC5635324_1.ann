T1	Context 0 203	Some of the earliest evidence that HIV-1 produces a stimulatory DNA PAMP during infection was obtained in human CD4+ T cells and macrophages that had been depleted for the cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 (42
T2	ACCURATE 1524 1750	In Trex1−/− mouse cells and human CD4+ T cells and macrophages in which TREX1 was inhibited by RNA interference, cytosolic HIV DNA accumulated, and HIV infection induced type I IFN that inhibited HIV replication and spreading.
T3	ACCURATE 29808 29917	HIV infection of its main target cells, macrophages and CD4+ T cells, does not induce cell-autonomous IFNs35.
T4	ACCURATE 30224 30374	The HIV-stimulated IFN response in cells deficient in TREX1, like the response to endogenous retroelement DNA and transfected DNA7, is IRF3-dependent.
T5	ACCURATE 1322 1399	However, HIV infection of T cells and macrophages does not trip these alarms.
