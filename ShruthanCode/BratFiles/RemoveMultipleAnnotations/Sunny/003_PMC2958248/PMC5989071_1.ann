T1	Context 395 622	For example, depletion of the host cytosolic DNA exonuclease three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), a DNA exonuclease, increases the type I interferon (IFN) response to HIV and murine leukemia virus (MLV) infection (4, 8, 9)
T2	ACCURATE 1260 1324	The cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 suppressed IFN triggered by HIV.
T3	ACCURATE 946 1024	# The cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 inhibits the innate immune response to HIV-1
T4	ACCURATE 1552 1703	TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway.
