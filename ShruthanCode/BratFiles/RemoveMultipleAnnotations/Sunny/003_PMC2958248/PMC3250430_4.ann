T3	MultiCitation 134 138	[36]
T1	Context 0 121	There is now evidence that HIV-1 has the potential to stimulate the innate immune system through its RNA, DNA, and capsid
T2	ACCURATE 31762 31991	Productive HIV infection of macrophages and T cells, however, involves viral membrane fusion with the cell membrane and direct uncoating of the viral capsid into the cytosol, bypassing the endosomal compartment and TLR signaling.
T4	ACCURATE 1387 1553	HIV introduces its single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome into a cell within the reverse transcription complex (RTC), which matures into the preintegration complex (PIC).
T5	ACCURATE 1554 1642	The PIC delivers reverse-transcribed HIV DNA to the nucleus for chromosomal integration.
T6	ACCURATE 1643 1744	Few copies of HIV DNA integrate, leaving behind HIV DNA in the cytosol to be cleared by host enzymes.
