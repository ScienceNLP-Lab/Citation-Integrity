T2	Context 1513 1864	nterestingly, Trex1 depletion led to increases in reverse transcription products retaining tRNA from both the wild-type and MLVD542N viruses, suggesting that negative-strand strong-stop DNA is also degraded by this cellular exonuclease (Fig. 4B); it has been previously shown that TREX1 degrades ssDNA and dsDNA and DNA in RNA/DNA hybrids (8, 30, 31).
T3	ACCURATE 16672 17028	None of the oligonucleotides induced IFN-β in Trex1−/−Irf3−/− MEFs (data not shown), supporting IRF3's role in signaling the presence of these cytosolic nucleic acids. Although synthetic oligonucleotides may not completely mimic native HIV RT products, these data are consistent with the known enzymatic preference of TREX1 for ssDNA vs dsDNA substrates15.
T4	ACCURATE 18477 18591	TREX1 metabolizes reverse-transcribed HIV DNA and transfected ssDNA and dsDNA in both mouse and human fibroblasts.
T5	ACCURATE 33722 33824	ssDNA is the nucleic acid most sensitive to TREX1 activity and is therefore likely its main substrate.
T6	ACCURATE 16450 16671	All DNA-containing oligonucleotides, but not ssRNA, induced more IFN-β in Trex1−/− compared to WT MEFs. ssDNA evoked the largest difference (~200-fold more IFN-β vs 20-40-fold for dsDNA and 2-4-fold for RNA:DNA duplexes).
