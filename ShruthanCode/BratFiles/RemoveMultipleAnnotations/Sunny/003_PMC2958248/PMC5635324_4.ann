T1	Context 614 715	In TREX1-depleted cells, escaped HIV-1 DNA is sensed by DNA sensor cyclic GMPâ€“AMP synthase (cGAS) (42
T2	MISQUOTE 2427 2528	HIV-stimulated IFN production in cells deficient in TREX1 did not involve known nucleic acid sensors.
T4	MISQUOTE 27169 27314	Thus, HIV DNA is detected by a pathway that signals though STING, TBK1 and IRF3 and does not involve any known DNA sensor (Supplementary Fig. 4).
