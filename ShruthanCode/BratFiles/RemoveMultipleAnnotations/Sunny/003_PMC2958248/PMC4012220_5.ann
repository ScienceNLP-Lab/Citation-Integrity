T1	Context 1196 1315	DNA being the main pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) detected by an innate immune sensor (Yan et al., 2010).
T2	ACCURATE 2437 2588	TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway.
T3	ACCURATE 31387 31616	Therefore our working model of the innate immune pathway activated by cytosolic HIV DNA starts with an unknown sensor (that may preferentially recognize ssDNA) that signals through STING, TBK1 and IRF3 to activate IFN expression.
