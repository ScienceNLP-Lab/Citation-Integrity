T1	Context 440 536	It is interesting to note that TREX1 has previously been implicated in the HIV-1 life cycle [42]
T2	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 19801 20021	WT TREX1 partially rescued HIV infection, but the enzymatically inactive D18N mutant had no effect, indicating that TREX1's exonuclease activity is needed for both inhibiting autointegration and blocking IFN-Î² induction.
T3	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 20415 20575	Because over-expressing WT GFP-TREX1 did not reduce HIV DNA abundance below that seen in an infected WT cell, TREX1 may not have access to all HIV DNA products.
