T1	Context 777 931	TREX1 was proposed to degrade cytosolic DNA resulting from HIV-1 reverse transcription, which would otherwise be capable of inducing an IFN response [42].
T3	ACCURATE 1605 1756	TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway.
T4	ACCURATE 1313 1377	The cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 suppressed IFN triggered by HIV.
