T2	Context 265 410	Overexpression of irisin in the liver of mice, via adenoviral delivery, increases energy expenditure and reduces high fat diet-induced obesity.67
T3	ACCURATE 23633 23760	We used adenoviral vectors to express full-length Fndc5 (or a control GFP) and examined its biological and therapeutic effects.
T4	ACCURATE 23761 23892	This method resulted in a 15-fold increase in liver Fndc5 mRNA, though the liver expresses very low endogenous levels of this mRNA.
T5	ACCURATE 26612 26866	Since activation of the classical brown fat or browning of white fat has been shown to improve obesity and glucose homeostasis in vivo6,13, we delivered Fndc5-expressing adenovirus to mice rendered obese and insulin-resistance by feeding a high fat diet.
T6	ACCURATE 27320 27573	This effect was accompanied with a large increase in oxygen consumption (Fig 6d), consistent with the gene expression data, and body weights of the irisin expressing mice were slightly reduced after 10 days compared to GFP-expressing controls (Fig. 6e).
T7	ACCURATE 27733 27879	Irisin expression in the high-fat fed mice caused a significant improvement in glucose tolerance when compared to the control mice expressing GFP.
