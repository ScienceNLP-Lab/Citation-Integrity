T1	Context 1018 1209	Interestingly, we found that Fndc5, the gene that codes for the recently discovered antidiabetic hormone irisin [39] was also significantly increased in Cox6a2 −/− diaphragm (data not shown).
T2	ACCURATE 1774 1939	Here we show that PGC1α expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of Fndc5, a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a new hormone, irisin.
T3	ACCURATE 3622 3762	The Fndc5 gene encodes a type I membrane protein that is processed proteolytically to form a new hormone secreted into blood, termed irisin.
