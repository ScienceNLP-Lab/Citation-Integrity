T1	Context 886 1274	Advances have recently been achieved on identification of several transcriptional factors and coregulators that specifically promote development and acquisition of the BAT-specific gene expression profile, including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), PRDM16, peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) (18–20).
T2	ACCURATE 3599 3737	Irisin is induced in exercise and activates profound changes in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, stimulating browning and UCP1 expression.
T3	ACCURATE 1776 1913	Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to stimulate UCP1 expression and a broad program of brown fat-like development.
T4	ACCURATE 11046 11307	Strikingly, UCP1 and 3 other known brown fat genes, Elovl3, Cox7a and Otop1, were among the 8 most up-regulated genes (Supplementary Fig. S4). Conversely, genes characteristic of white fat development were down-regulated, such as leptin (Supplementary Fig. S3).
T5	ACCURATE 6063 6213	Thus, muscle- specific expression of PGC1α drives browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue, possibly recapitulating part of the exercise program.
