T2	Context 309 540	In recent years, numerous myokines have been proposed to be secreted from muscle, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) (1), fibroblast growth factor 21 (3), follistatin-like 1 (2), insulin-like 6 factor (4), and most recently irisin (5).
T3	ACCURATE 1044 1209	Here we show that PGC1α expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of Fndc5, a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a new hormone, irisin.
T4	ACCURATE 7162 7291	This suggested that PGC1α causes the muscle cells to secrete molecule(s) that can induce a thermogenic gene program in the cells.
T5	ACCURATE 2612 2751	This strongly suggests that PGC1α might stimulate the secretion of factors from skeletal muscle that affects the function of other tissues.
T6	ACCURATE 2892 3032	The Fndc5 gene encodes a type I membrane protein that is processed proteolytically to form a new hormone secreted into blood, termed irisin.
T7	ACCURATE 2752 2891	In this paper, we show that PGC1α stimulates the expression of several muscle gene-products that are potentially secreted, including Fndc5.
T8	ACCURATE 28970 29141	This paper describes a new polypeptide hormone, irisin, which is regulated by PGC1α, secreted from muscle into blood and activates thermogenic function in adipose tissues.
