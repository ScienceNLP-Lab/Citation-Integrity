T2	Context 562 739	These have been used to express a protein that is cleaved to the myokine irisin in skeletal muscle, and irisin was claimed to increase energy expenditure (Bostrom et al., 2012).
T4	ACCURATE 27564 27817	This effect was accompanied with a large increase in oxygen consumption (Fig 6d), consistent with the gene expression data, and body weights of the irisin expressing mice were slightly reduced after 10 days compared to GFP-expressing controls (Fig. 6e).
T5	ACCURATE 3773 3906	Importantly, this causes a significant increase in total body energy expenditure and resistance to obesity-linked insulin-resistance.
T6	ACCURATE 1949 2136	Irisin is induced with exercise in mice and humans, and mildly increased irisin levels in blood cause an increase in energy expenditure in mice with no changes in movement or food intake.
