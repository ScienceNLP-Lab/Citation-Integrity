T1	Context 1258 1367	Irisin, encoded by the Fndc5 gene, is a newly identified hormone from the muscle of PGC-1α transgenic mice.67
T2	ACCURATE 2020 2185	Here we show that PGC1α expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of Fndc5, a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a new hormone, irisin.
T3	ACCURATE 2324 2511	Irisin is induced with exercise in mice and humans, and mildly increased irisin levels in blood cause an increase in energy expenditure in mice with no changes in movement or food intake.
