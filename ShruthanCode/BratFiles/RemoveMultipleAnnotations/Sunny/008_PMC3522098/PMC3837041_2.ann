T2	Context 0 368	PGC-1α and PRDM16 are transcriptional coactivators involved in the control of energy metabolism, and ectopic expression of PGC-1α and PRDM16 in WAT induces acquisition of BAT features, including expression of mitochondrial and fatty acid oxidation and thermogenic genes to limit weight gain and improve glucose intolerance in response to a high-fat diet (HFD) (20–23).
T3	ACCURATE 1756 1820	This results in improvements in obesity and glucose homeostasis.
T4	ACCURATE 1264 1429	Here we show that PGC1α expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of Fndc5, a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a new hormone, irisin.
T5	ACCURATE 27596 27742	Irisin expression in the high-fat fed mice caused a significant improvement in glucose tolerance when compared to the control mice expressing GFP.
T6	ACCURATE 24358 24514	There were no changes in expression of UCP1 in the interscapular BAT, but we did observe a minor elevation in PRDM16 and PGC1α mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S8).
