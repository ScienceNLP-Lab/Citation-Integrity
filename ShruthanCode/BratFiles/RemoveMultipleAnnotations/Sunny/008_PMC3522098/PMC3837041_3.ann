T1	Context 309 445	The stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) from fat depots of mice treated with EPO or saline was prepared and differentiated as described (20)
T5	Context 447 587	At the beginning of differentiation induction, cells were treated with EPO, at 5 units/mL or at the dosage indicated, or with vehicle (PBS).
T6	Context 588 689	3T3-L1 and primary human adipocytes (H-adipocytes) were differentiated with EPO treatment for 9 days.
T7	Context 690 757	SVF was differentiated to adipocytes with EPO treatment for 6 days.
T3	ACCURATE 11498 11648	SVF from the inguinal fat depot was differentiated into adipocytes for 6 days in the presence of saline, recombinant Fndc5 (20 nM), or BMP-7 (3.3 Î¼M).
T4	ACCURATE 35329 35509	24 hours after transfection, media was removed, and cells were washed in large volumes of PBS five times, followed by incubation in Freestyle serum-free media (GIBCO) for 24 hours.
