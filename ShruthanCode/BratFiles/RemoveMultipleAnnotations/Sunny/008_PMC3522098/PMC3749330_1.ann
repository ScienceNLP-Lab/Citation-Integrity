T1	Context 119 308	There is increasing evidence that skeletal muscles express myokines, hormone-like factors that are released into the serum to function in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner (1–5).
T2	ACCURATE 776 855	# A PGC1α-dependent myokine that drives browning of white fat and thermogenesis
T3	ACCURATE 2612 2751	This strongly suggests that PGC1α might stimulate the secretion of factors from skeletal muscle that affects the function of other tissues.
T4	ACCURATE 2752 2891	In this paper, we show that PGC1α stimulates the expression of several muscle gene-products that are potentially secreted, including Fndc5.
T5	ACCURATE 2892 3032	The Fndc5 gene encodes a type I membrane protein that is processed proteolytically to form a new hormone secreted into blood, termed irisin.
T6	ACCURATE 3033 3171	Irisin is induced in exercise and activates profound changes in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, stimulating browning and UCP1 expression.
