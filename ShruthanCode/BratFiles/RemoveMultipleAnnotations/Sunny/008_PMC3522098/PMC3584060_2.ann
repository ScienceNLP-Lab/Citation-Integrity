T2	Context 1896 2113	This suggests the existence of a crosstalk between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, as was recently shown with the identification of a new hormone, irisin, which stimulates browning and UCP1 expression in WAT [39].
T3	ACCURATE 4695 4833	Irisin is induced in exercise and activates profound changes in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, stimulating browning and UCP1 expression.
T4	ACCURATE 16933 17059	This nuclear receptor has been shown to drive UCP1 expression and several other genes involved in browning of adipose cells10.
T5	ACCURATE 21185 21372	The ability of the anti-Fndc5 antibodies to react with irisin allowed us to investigate the contribution made by irisin to the browning activity secreted by muscle cells expressing PGC1Î±.
