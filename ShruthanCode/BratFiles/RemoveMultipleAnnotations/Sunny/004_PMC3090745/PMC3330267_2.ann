T3	ACCURATE 18407 18894	Examining the amount of genetic effect attributable to these candidate genes, the most strongly associated SNPs at each locus other than APOE demonstrated population attributable fractions (PAFs) between 2.72–5.97% (Supplemental Table 9), with a cumulative PAF for non-APOE loci estimated to be as much as 35%; however, these estimates may vary widely between studies22, and the actual effect sizes are likely to be much smaller than those estimated here because of the ‘winner’s curse’.
