T5	MultiCitation 1886 1890	[28]
T1	Context 1796 1890	Nevertheless, we did find associations with cisSNPs for ABCA7, a novel AD risk locus gene [28]
T2	ACCURATE 6700 6869	Because Hollingworth et al.12 identified SNPs at ABCA7 as a novel LOAD locus, we included ABCA7 region SNPs in Stage 2 and provided the results to Hollingworth et al.12.
T3	ACCURATE 19295 19461	With our findings and those by Hollingsworth et al.12, there are now ten LOAD susceptibility loci (APOE, CR1, CLU, PICALM, BIN1, EPHA1, MS4A, CD33, CD2AP, and ABCA7).
