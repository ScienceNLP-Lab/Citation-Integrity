T1	MultiCitation 211 215	[35]
T2	Context 0 215	All variants classified as “likely pathogenic” or with an “unknown pathogenicity”, and some “non-pathogenic” variants were genotyped in 961 sporadic AD cases, 1,346 unrelated elderly non-demented controls [34], [35]
T3	CONTRADICT 1942 2442	To identify genetic variants associated with risk for AD, the ADGC assembled a discovery dataset [Stage 1; 8,309 LOAD cases, 7,366 cognitively normal controls (CNEs)] using data from eight cohorts and a ninth newly assembled cohort from the 29 NIA-funded Alzheimer Disease Centers (ADCs) (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, Supplementary Note) with data coordinated by the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) and samples coordinated by the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease (NCRAD).
T4	CONTRADICT 2443 2573	For the Stage 2 replication, we used four additional datasets and additional samples from the ADCs (3,531 LOAD cases, 3,565 CNEs).
