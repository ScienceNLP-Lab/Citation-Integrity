T3	MultiCitation 459 463	[28]
T1	Context 405 463	ABCA7, identified recently as a novel LOAD risk locus [28]
T2	ACCURATE 5415 5584	Because Hollingworth et al.12 identified SNPs at ABCA7 as a novel LOAD locus, we included ABCA7 region SNPs in Stage 2 and provided the results to Hollingworth et al.12.
T4	ACCURATE 14692 14858	Hollingworth et al 12 report highly significant evidence for the association of an ABCA7 SNP rs3764650 with LOAD (PM = 4.5 × 10−17) that included data from our study.
