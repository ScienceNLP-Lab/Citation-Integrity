T1	Context 0 341	Since 2009, four GWAS and a three-stage analysis of the GWAS resulted in the identification of nine novel loci associated with late-onset AD: CLU, PICALM, CR1, BIN1, ABCA7, MS4A cluster (MS4A6A/MS4A4E), CD2AP, CD33, and EPHA1 (Harold et al., 2009; Lambert et al., 2009; Seshadri et al., 2010; Hollingworth et al., 2011a,b; Naj et al., 2011).
T2	ACCURATE 959 1068	# Common variants in MS4A4/MS4A6E, CD2uAP, CD33, and EPHA1 are associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease
T3	ACCURATE 2300 2383	A recent GWAS identified CR1, CLU, PICALM, and BIN1 as LOAD susceptibility loci1–3.
T4	ACCURATE 1390 1713	We obtained genome-wide significant results at MS4A4A [rs4938933; Stages 1+2, meta-analysis (PM) = 1.7 × 10−9, joint analysis (PJ) = 1.7 × 10−9; Stages 1–3, PM = 8.2 × 10−12], CD2AP (rs9349407; Stages 1–3, PM = 8.6 × 10−9), EPHA1 (rs11767557; Stages 1–3 PM = 6.0 × 10−10), and CD33 (rs3865444; Stages 1–3, PM = 1.6 × 10−9).
T5	ACCURATE 1714 1974	We confirmed that CR1 (rs6701713; PM = 4.6×10−10, PJ = 5.2×10−11), CLU (rs1532278; PM = 8.3 × 10−8, PJ = 1.9×10−8), BIN1 (rs7561528; PM = 4.0×10−14; PJ = 5.2×10−14), and PICALM (rs561655; PM = 7.0 × 10−11, PJ = 1.0×10−10) but not EXOC3L2 are LOAD risk loci1–3.
