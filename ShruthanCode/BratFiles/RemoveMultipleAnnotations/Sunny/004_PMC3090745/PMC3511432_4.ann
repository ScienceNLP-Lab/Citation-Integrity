T3	MultiCitation 629 633	[10]
T1	Context 538 633	While several genes in the MS4A gene cluster have been identified in recent LOAD GWAS [9], [10]
T2	ACCURATE 1148 1257	# Common variants in MS4A4/MS4A6E, CD2uAP, CD33, and EPHA1 are associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease
T4	ACCURATE 1579 1902	We obtained genome-wide significant results at MS4A4A [rs4938933; Stages 1+2, meta-analysis (PM) = 1.7 × 10−9, joint analysis (PJ) = 1.7 × 10−9; Stages 1–3, PM = 8.2 × 10−12], CD2AP (rs9349407; Stages 1–3, PM = 8.6 × 10−9), EPHA1 (rs11767557; Stages 1–3 PM = 6.0 × 10−10), and CD33 (rs3865444; Stages 1–3, PM = 1.6 × 10−9).
T5	ACCURATE 18429 18595	With our findings and those by Hollingsworth et al.12, there are now ten LOAD susceptibility loci (APOE, CR1, CLU, PICALM, BIN1, EPHA1, MS4A, CD33, CD2AP, and ABCA7).
