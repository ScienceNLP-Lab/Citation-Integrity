T1	Context 0 296	To determine if the LOAD GWAS SNPs influence gene expression, we analyzed the association of SNP genotype with gene expression using an ANCOVA and testing for association with an additive model, the model utilized when originally reporting association between these SNPs and risk for AD [5]â€“[10].
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 3650 3912	We performed association analysis assuming an additive model on the log odds ratio scale with adjustment for population substructure using logistic regression for case-control data and generalized estimating equations (GEE) with a logistic model for family data.
