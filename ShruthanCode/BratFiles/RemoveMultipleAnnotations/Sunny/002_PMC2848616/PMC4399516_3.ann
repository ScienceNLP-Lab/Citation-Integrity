T1	Context 364 497	Accordingly, inhibition of mTOR activity induces autophagy, lessens the aggregates of Aβ, and enhances the process of Aβ clearance.23
T2	ACCURATE 1715 2025	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
T4	ACCURATE 5927 6042	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was strongly activated in hippocampus of rapamycin-treated mice.
T5	ACCURATE 16805 16873	Inhibition of the mTOR pathway by rapamycin activates autophagy[40].
T6	ACCURATE 19568 19759	Taken together, our results suggest that autophagy is induced by rapamycin-mediated mTOR inhibition specifically as a response to high Aβ levels in hippocampi of rapamycin-treated PDAPP mice.
