T1	Context 345 426	Decreased mTOR signaling leads to reduction in levels of Aβ (Spilman et al., 2010
T2	ACCURATE 20659 20859	The data presented here are, to our knowledge, the first to show that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin decreased Aβ42 levels ( Fig. 2 ) and rescued cognitive function ( Fig. 1 ) in a mouse model of AD.
T3	ACCURATE 20466 20657	Taken together, our results suggest that autophagy is induced by rapamycin-mediated mTOR inhibition specifically as a response to high Aβ levels in hippocampi of rapamycin-treated PDAPP mice.
