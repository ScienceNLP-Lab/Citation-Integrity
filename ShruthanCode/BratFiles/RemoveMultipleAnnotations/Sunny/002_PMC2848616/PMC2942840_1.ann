T1	Context 1023 1253	In contrast, mTOR signaling was shown to be up-regulated in 7PA2 cells over-expressing mutant APP and in brains of another AD transgenic mouse, with rapamycin treatment reported as protective against behavioral decline [13], [14].
T2	ACCURATE 8853 9182	The effect of rapamycin treatment became more pronounced as training progressed, as indicated by the slopes for the learning curves (m = −5.14 for rapamycin-treated as compared to m = −3.58 for control- treated PDAPP transgenic mice; m = −4 for rapamycin-treated as compared to m = −2.95 for control-treated non-transgenic mice).
T3	ACCURATE 10865 11054	a–c, Levels of phosphorylated (activated) p70 were decreased in brains of rapamycin-treated non-transgenic (a) and transgenic PDAPP (b) mice (c, **, P = 0.006 and *, P = 0.01 respectively).
T4	ACCURATE 21096 21380	Consistent with a key role for high levels of Aβ in the activation of autophagy when mTOR activity is reduced, rapamycin did not induce autophagy in brains of rapamycin-treated non-transgenic mice, in which levels of endogenous Aβ are much lower than those in PDAPP transgenic brains.
T5	ACCURATE 2286 2479	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of Aβ42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T6	ACCURATE 6454 6658	Here we show that long-term mTOR inhibition by rapamycin inhibited mTOR in brain, prevented AD-like cognitive deficits ( Fig. 1 ) and lowered levels of Aβ42 ( Fig. 2 ) in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
