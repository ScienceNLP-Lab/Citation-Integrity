T1	Context 512 637	Data in apparent contradiction to each other have been also reported by others [5], [29], [32], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75].
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 6229 6303	The role of the mTOR pathway and of autophagy in AD is thus still unclear.
T4	OVERSIMPLIFY 5492 5815	While excessive autophagic activity can lead to cell death, increased autophagy has been shown to facilitate the clearance of aggregation- prone proteins such as Aβ[20], [21], [22], pathological prion protein[23], [24], and α-synuclein[25], and to promote neuronal survival in a variety of neurodegenerative disease models.
T5	OVERSIMPLIFY 7581 7820	Thus, our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can lower Aβ levels and slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease, possibly by stimulating autophagy.
T6	OVERSIMPLIFY 6827 6977	These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway by long-term rapamycin treatment can reduce Aβ42 levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice.
