T1	Context 490 657	Furthermore, rapamycin administration improved memory functions in murine models of AD (Caccamo et al., 2010[13]; Majumder et al., 2012[48]; Spilman et al., 2010[75]).
T2	ACCURATE 9000 9051	b, Rapamycin restores spatial memory in PDAPP mice.
T3	ACCURATE 13710 14028	Rapamycin-fed transgenic PDAPP mice, however, showed improved learning ( Figure 1a ) and memory ( Figure 1b ), with improved performances on the last day of training and retention of the former location of the escape platform restored to levels indistinguishable from those of non-transgenic littermates ( Figure 1b ).
T4	ACCURATE 14777 14904	Thus, our data indicate that rapamycin treatment can ameliorate learning deficits and abolish memory impairments in PDAPP mice.
