T3	ACCURATE 12836 13031	A recent report showed that microencapsulated rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway[5], or genetic ablation of the mTOR target S6K1[6] extends lifespan in mice, possibly by retarding aging.
T4	ACCURATE 13534 13850	At the end of treatment (7 mo), learning and memory were tested using the Morris water maze [11], [31], [33], [34]. Consistent with our and others' previous observations [11], [29], [31], [32], [35], we observed significant deficits in learning and memory in control-fed transgenic PDAPP animals ( Figure 1a and b ).
T5	ACCURATE 13851 14169	Rapamycin-fed transgenic PDAPP mice, however, showed improved learning ( Figure 1a ) and memory ( Figure 1b ), with improved performances on the last day of training and retention of the former location of the escape platform restored to levels indistinguishable from those of non-transgenic littermates ( Figure 1b ).
T6	ACCURATE 22162 22500	Although the differences in performance between control-fed and rapamycin-fed non- transgenic groups were not significant, they may suggest that changes in pathways different from autophagy (such as effects on the regulation of protein synthesis) as a result of long-term mTOR inhibition may have a positive effect on learning and memory.
