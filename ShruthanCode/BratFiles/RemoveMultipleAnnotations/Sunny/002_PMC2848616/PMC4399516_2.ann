T2	Context 276 356	mTOR also modulates the metabolism of APP by regulating β- and γ-secretase.23,44
T3	ACCURATE 2538 2733	The accumulation of soluble oligomeric forms of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), derived from proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), is a major cause of neurotoxicity in AD[8].
T4	ACCURATE 1437 1630	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of Aβ42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T5	ACCURATE 1631 1748	These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway can reduce Aβ42 levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice.
T6	ACCURATE 15417 15520	Levels of Aβ42, but not of Aβ40, were reduced in rapamycin-treated transgenic PDAPP mice ( Figure 2d ).
T7	ACCURATE 15184 15416	Phosphorylation of the mTOR target p70S6K[6] was reduced in brains of both rapamycin-treated PDAPP mice and non-transgenic littermates, indicating that mTOR activity was inhibited ( Fig. 2a–c )[36], [37] in brains of both genotypes.
