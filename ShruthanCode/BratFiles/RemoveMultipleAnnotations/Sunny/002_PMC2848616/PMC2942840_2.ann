T2	Context 795 1012	In addition, although it is well established that acute inhibition of mTOR impairs synaptic plasticity, it was recently reported that chronic treatment with rapamycin improved behavior of AD transgenic mice [13], [14]
T3	ACCURATE 2598 2791	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of Aβ42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T4	ACCURATE 3252 3430	Our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease.
T5	ACCURATE 7725 7964	Thus, our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can lower Aβ levels and slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease, possibly by stimulating autophagy.
T6	ACCURATE 14509 14827	Rapamycin-fed transgenic PDAPP mice, however, showed improved learning ( Figure 1a ) and memory ( Figure 1b ), with improved performances on the last day of training and retention of the former location of the escape platform restored to levels indistinguishable from those of non-transgenic littermates ( Figure 1b ).
T7	ACCURATE 6971 7121	These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway by long-term rapamycin treatment can reduce Aβ42 levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice.
T8	ACCURATE 7238 7536	Activation of autophagy was prominent in transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice ( Fig. 3 ), suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function may be due in part to increased autophagy in neurons, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ in transgenic mice.
