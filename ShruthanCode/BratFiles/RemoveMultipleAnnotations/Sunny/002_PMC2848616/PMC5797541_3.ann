T1	Context 0 262	Rapamycin, a selective inhibitor of target-of-rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) and thus modulator of the mTOR pathway activity, improved learning and memory and reduced Aβ and tau pathology in the brains of AD mouse model (Caccamo et al., 2010; Spilman et al., 2010).
T3	ACCURATE 3466 3660	The target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is a major signaling hub that integrates nutrient/growth factor availability with cell metabolism[12] through two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2[13].
T4	ACCURATE 5721 5914	A recent report showed that long-term treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway[5], or ablation of the mTOR target S6K1[6] extends lifespan in mice, possibly by delaying aging.
T5	ACCURATE 6038 6242	Here we show that long-term mTOR inhibition by rapamycin inhibited mTOR in brain, prevented AD-like cognitive deficits ( Fig. 1 ) and lowered levels of Aβ42 ( Fig. 2 ) in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T6	ACCURATE 6997 7236	Thus, our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can lower Aβ levels and slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease, possibly by stimulating autophagy.
