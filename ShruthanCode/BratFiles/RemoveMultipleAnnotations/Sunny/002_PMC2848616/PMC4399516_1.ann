T1	Context 941 1047	Therefore, the development of mTOR inhibitors may also be useful for the prevention and treatment of AD.23
T2	ACCURATE 2607 2785	Our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease.
T3	ACCURATE 6121 6325	Here we show that long-term mTOR inhibition by rapamycin inhibited mTOR in brain, prevented AD-like cognitive deficits ( Fig. 1 ) and lowered levels of Aβ42 ( Fig. 2 ) in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T4	ACCURATE 6326 6476	These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway by long-term rapamycin treatment can reduce Aβ42 levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice.
T5	ACCURATE 7320 7439	Rapamycin, already used in clinical settings, may be a potentially effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.
