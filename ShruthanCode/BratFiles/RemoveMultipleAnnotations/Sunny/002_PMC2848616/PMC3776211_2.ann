T2	Context 631 770	Rapamycin induced inhibition of mTORC1 has also been shown to decrease beta-amyloid expression by increasing the rate of autophagy [18,29].
T3	ACCURATE 4354 4475	Since Akt positively regulates mTORC1, phosphorylation of Akt by mTORC2 stimulates mTORC1 function, inhibiting autophagy.
T4	ACCURATE 3884 4181	In addition, mTORC1 inhibits autophagy when nutrients and energy are plentiful through the phosphorylation of Unc51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) and mAtg13, the mammalian homologs of the yeast kinase Atg1 and Atg13 respectively, which are essential for the formation of pre-autophagosomal structures [14].
T5	ACCURATE 6178 6382	Here we show that long-term mTOR inhibition by rapamycin inhibited mTOR in brain, prevented AD-like cognitive deficits ( Fig. 1 ) and lowered levels of Aβ42 ( Fig. 2 ) in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T6	ACCURATE 7137 7376	Thus, our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can lower Aβ levels and slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease, possibly by stimulating autophagy.
T7	ACCURATE 6650 6948	Activation of autophagy was prominent in transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice ( Fig. 3 ), suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function may be due in part to increased autophagy in neurons, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ in transgenic mice.
