T1	Context 242 398	Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin retards cognitive deficits and reduces the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau by autophagy enhancement in AD models.23,183
T2	ACCURATE 1641 1834	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of Aβ42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T3	ACCURATE 1953 2263	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
T4	ACCURATE 6281 6579	Activation of autophagy was prominent in transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice ( Fig. 3 ), suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function may be due in part to increased autophagy in neurons, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ in transgenic mice.
T5	ACCURATE 21863 22201	Although the differences in performance between control-fed and rapamycin-fed non- transgenic groups were not significant, they may suggest that changes in pathways different from autophagy (such as effects on the regulation of protein synthesis) as a result of long-term mTOR inhibition may have a positive effect on learning and memory.
