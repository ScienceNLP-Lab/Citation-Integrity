T2	Context 530 756	A study performed by Spilman et al. (2010) on mouse model of AD reported that blocking the mTOR signaling with rapamycin relieves cognitive deficits and reduces amyloid pathology, likely by activating autophagy in brain cells.
T3	ACCURATE 2301 2494	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of Aβ42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T4	ACCURATE 6941 7239	Activation of autophagy was prominent in transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice ( Fig. 3 ), suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function may be due in part to increased autophagy in neurons, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ in transgenic mice.
T5	ACCURATE 22523 22861	Although the differences in performance between control-fed and rapamycin-fed non- transgenic groups were not significant, they may suggest that changes in pathways different from autophagy (such as effects on the regulation of protein synthesis) as a result of long-term mTOR inhibition may have a positive effect on learning and memory.
T6	ACCURATE 14212 14530	Rapamycin-fed transgenic PDAPP mice, however, showed improved learning ( Figure 1a ) and memory ( Figure 1b ), with improved performances on the last day of training and retention of the former location of the escape platform restored to levels indistinguishable from those of non-transgenic littermates ( Figure 1b ).
