T1	Context 1830 1931	Under some conditions, autophagy can offer cytoprotection during neurodegenerative disorders [92,93].
T2	ACCURATE 7501 7714	Supporting the notion that autophagy may have a protective role in AD, deletion of the beclin 1 gene in PDAPP mice impaired autophagy and resulted in large increases in Aβ levels and accelerated Aβ deposition[26].
T3	ACCURATE 7177 7500	While excessive autophagic activity can lead to cell death, increased autophagy has been shown to facilitate the clearance of aggregation- prone proteins such as Aβ[20], [21], [22], pathological prion protein[23], [24], and α-synuclein[25], and to promote neuronal survival in a variety of neurodegenerative disease models.
T4	ACCURATE 9266 9505	Thus, our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can lower Aβ levels and slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease, possibly by stimulating autophagy.
