T1	Context 634 876	Interestingly, this treatment induced autophagy marked by increased expression of Atg 7, Atg5-Atg12, decrease in p62, no modification of LC3 expression and controversial results surrounding LC3-II expression in PDAPP and 3xTg-AD mice [45,46].
T5	CONTRADICT 20087 20285	LC3-immunoreactive puncta were increased in the projections of hippocampal neurons of rapamycin-treated PDAPP mice ( Fig. 3câ€“d ), suggesting that LC3 was redistributed to a vesicle-like compartment.
T6	CONTRADICT 12698 12831	An increase in LC3-immunoreactive puncta was observed in CA1 projections of transgenic PDAPP mice following rapamycin administration.
