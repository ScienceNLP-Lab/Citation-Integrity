T1	Context 161 322	Furthermore, many studies have revealed that the stimulation of autophagy can reduce Aβ accumulation and alleviate memory deficits in transgenic AD mice [45-48].
T2	ACCURATE 12942 13116	At 4 mo, hAPP(J20) PDAPP mice [9], [10], [11], [29], [30], [31], [32] show high Aβ levels and synaptic dysfunction[11], [32], but no Aβ plaques or spatial memory impairments.
T3	ACCURATE 13434 13752	Rapamycin-fed transgenic PDAPP mice, however, showed improved learning ( Figure 1a ) and memory ( Figure 1b ), with improved performances on the last day of training and retention of the former location of the escape platform restored to levels indistinguishable from those of non-transgenic littermates ( Figure 1b ).
T4	ACCURATE 6163 6461	Activation of autophagy was prominent in transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice ( Fig. 3 ), suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function may be due in part to increased autophagy in neurons, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ in transgenic mice.
T5	ACCURATE 1835 2145	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
