T1	Context 996 1104	More recently in animal models Rapamycin has been found to be a good candidate for the treatment of AD [29].
T3	ACCURATE 22788 22989	In summary, our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin[5], an intervention that extends lifespan in mice[5], [6], can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease.
T4	ACCURATE 22990 23118	Rapamycin, already used in clinical settings, may thus be a potentially effective therapy for the prevention or treatment of AD.
T5	ACCURATE 2010 2203	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of AÎ²42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T6	ACCURATE 2664 2962	Our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease. Rapamycin, already used in clinical settings, may be a potentially effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.
T7	ACCURATE 7377 7495	Rapamycin, already used in clinical settings, may be a potentially effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD
