T3	ACCURATE 1518 1711	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of Aβ42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T4	ACCURATE 5686 5890	Here we show that long-term mTOR inhibition by rapamycin inhibited mTOR in brain, prevented AD-like cognitive deficits ( Fig. 1 ) and lowered levels of Aβ42 ( Fig. 2 ) in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T5	ACCURATE 1712 1829	These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway can reduce Aβ42 levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice.
T6	ACCURATE 13429 13747	Rapamycin-fed transgenic PDAPP mice, however, showed improved learning ( Figure 1a ) and memory ( Figure 1b ), with improved performances on the last day of training and retention of the former location of the escape platform restored to levels indistinguishable from those of non-transgenic littermates ( Figure 1b ).
