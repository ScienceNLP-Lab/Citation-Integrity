T1	Context 736 838	In addition, Autophagy has been shown to protect neurons from Aβ induced cytotoxicity [44], [45], [46]
T2	ACCURATE 2057 2366	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ
T3	ACCURATE 4783 5106	While excessive autophagic activity can lead to cell death, increased autophagy has been shown to facilitate the clearance of aggregation- prone proteins such as Aβ[20], [21], [22], pathological prion protein[23], [24], and α-synuclein[25], and to promote neuronal survival in a variety of neurodegenerative disease models.
T4	ACCURATE 6385 6683	Activation of autophagy was prominent in transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice ( Fig. 3 ), suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function may be due in part to increased autophagy in neurons, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ in transgenic mice.
