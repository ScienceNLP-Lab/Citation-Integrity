T3	ACCURATE 4578 4634	The greatest known risk factor for AD is increasing age.
T4	ACCURATE 4114 4233	Rapamycin, already used in clinical settings, may be a potentially effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.
T5	ACCURATE 14177 14372	A recent report showed that microencapsulated rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway[5], or genetic ablation of the mTOR target S6K1[6] extends lifespan in mice, possibly by retarding aging.
T6	ACCURATE 15192 15510	Rapamycin-fed transgenic PDAPP mice, however, showed improved learning ( Figure 1a ) and memory ( Figure 1b ), with improved performances on the last day of training and retention of the former location of the escape platform restored to levels indistinguishable from those of non-transgenic littermates ( Figure 1b ).
