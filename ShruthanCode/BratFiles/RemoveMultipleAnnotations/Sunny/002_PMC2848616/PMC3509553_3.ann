T1	Context 1031 1156	However, autophagy may be necessary during inhibition of mTOR signaling to improve cognitive function, limit Aβ toxicity [93]
T3	ACCURATE 2775 3085	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
T4	ACCURATE 7103 7401	Activation of autophagy was prominent in transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice ( Fig. 3 ), suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function may be due in part to increased autophagy in neurons, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ in transgenic mice.
T5	ACCURATE 21022 21272	Our data suggest that the reduction in Aβ42 levels and the improvement in cognitive function in rapamycin-treated PDAPP mice may be a consequence of the induction of autophagy in hippocampus ( Fig. 3 ) by high levels of Aβ in PDAPP transgenic brains.
T6	ACCURATE 21558 21773	In addition, rapamycin treatment did not induce autophagy and did not affect levels of endogenous Aβ in non-transgenic mice, suggesting that autophagy may have a key role in reducing Aβ42 in transgenic PDAPP brains.
T7	ACCURATE 22274 22460	Prolonged rapamycin treatment may thus release mTOR-mediated inhibition of autophagy and allow for the reduction of Aβ levels through this clearance mechanism in transgenic PDAPP brains.
