T1	Context 1363 1489	Furthermore, inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease [37].
T2	ACCURATE 2395 2588	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of Aβ42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model.
T3	ACCURATE 3049 3227	Our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease.
T4	ACCURATE 6919 7034	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was strongly activated in hippocampus of rapamycin-treated mice.
T5	ACCURATE 6768 6918	These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway by long-term rapamycin treatment can reduce Aβ42 levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice.
