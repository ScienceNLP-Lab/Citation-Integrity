T1	Context 483 719	These data and families also overlap with those reported by Voineagu et al.[13], who, included in their expression profiling study, used the AGRE data to perform an analysis searching for evidence of a genetic enrichment of immune loci.

T3	ACCURATE 2870 3083	Moreover, using a published autism GWAS dataset, we show that the neuronal module is enriched for genetically associated variants, providing independent support for the causal involvement of these genes in autism.
T4	ACCURATE 2478 2744	We further identify discrete modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism: a neuronal module enriched for known autism susceptibility genes, including the neuronal specific splicing factor A2BP1/FOX1, and a module enriched for immune genes and glial markers.
