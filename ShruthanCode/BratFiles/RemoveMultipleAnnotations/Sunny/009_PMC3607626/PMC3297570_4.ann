T1	Context 159 429	To study how the enrichment of rare and common variants corresponded to this study, we tested the overlap between the neuronal modules obtained in our study and the neuronal module that was previously shown to be differentially expressed between cases and controls [20].
T2	ACCURATE 1500 1766	We further identify discrete modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism: a neuronal module enriched for known autism susceptibility genes, including the neuronal specific splicing factor A2BP1/FOX1, and a module enriched for immune genes and glial markers.
T4	ACCURATE 1892 2105	Moreover, using a published autism GWAS dataset, we show that the neuronal module is enriched for genetically associated variants, providing independent support for the causal involvement of these genes in autism.
T5	ACCURATE 1152 1299	Here, we demonstrate consistent differences in transcriptome organization between autistic and normal brain by gene co-expression network analysis.
