T1	MultiCitation 275 279	[13]
T2	Context 161 405	The differences in the results between our study and other whole genome transcriptomic analyses of autistic brain [13], [28] may be due to etiological heterogeneity together with the use of different criteria for sample selection in each study.
T3	ACCURATE 3436 3622	For each individual, we profiled three regions previously implicated in autism5: superior temporal gyrus (STG /Brodmannâ€™s area [BA] 41/42), prefrontal cortex (BA9) and cerebellar vermis.
T4	ACCURATE 4240 4419	There was no significant difference in age, post mortem interval (PMI), or RNA integrity numbers (RIN) between autism and control cortex samples (Supplementary Figure 1, Methods).
T5	ACCURATE 13138 13454	We assessed module eigengene relationship to autism disease status, age, gender, cause of death, co-morbidity of seizures, family history of psychiatric disease, and medication, providing a complementary assessment of these potential confounders to that performed in the standard DE analysis (Supplementary Table 9).
