T1	Context 278 470	The most comprehensive transcriptomics study of ASD post-mortem brain to date (Voineagu et al) concludes that one of two significant co-expression networks is involved in immune function [32].
T3	ACCURATE 1665 1931	We further identify discrete modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism: a neuronal module enriched for known autism susceptibility genes, including the neuronal specific splicing factor A2BP1/FOX1, and a module enriched for immune genes and glial markers.
T4	ACCURATE 15348 15612	The second module of co-expressed genes highly related to autism disease status, M16, was enriched for astrocyte markers and markers of activated microglia (Supplementary Table 9), as well as for genes belonging to immune and inflammatory GO categories (Figure 2).
T5	ACCURATE 15613 15806	This module, which was upregulated in ASD brain, showed significant similarity to two modules identified in previous studies of normal human brain8: an astrocyte module and a microglial module.
