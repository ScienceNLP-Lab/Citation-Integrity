T1	MultiCitation 155 159	[32]
T2	Context 8 160	we were interested in considering our findings in the context of the major three published transcriptomics studies on ASD brain tissue [30], [31], [32].
T3	Context 621 711	as both our approach and whole-transcriptomics studies implicate immune signaling pathways
T6	INDIRECT 22322 22537	Since immune molecules and cells such as microglia play a role in synaptic development and function26, we speculate that the observed immune up- regulation may be related to abnormal ongoing plasticity in ASD brain.
