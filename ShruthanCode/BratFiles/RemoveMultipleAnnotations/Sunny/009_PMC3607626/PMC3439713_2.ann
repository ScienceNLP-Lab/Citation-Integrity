T2	Context 0 301	The lack of an enrichment of significant associations in immune genes corroborates the findings by Voineagu et al.[13], who used a complimentary approach to test for evidence of a genetic component for the up-regulation of immune response genes in the autistic brain using the same AGRE genotype data.
T3	ACCURATE 21917 22132	Since immune molecules and cells such as microglia play a role in synaptic development and function26, we speculate that the observed immune up- regulation may be related to abnormal ongoing plasticity in ASD brain.
T4	ACCURATE 21595 21916	We show that the transcriptome changes observed in ASD brain converge with GWAS data in supporting the genetic basis of synaptic and neuronal signaling dysfunction in ASD, while immune changes have a less pronounced genetic component and thus are most likely either secondary phenomena or caused by environmental factors.
T5	ACCURATE 15218 15411	This module, which was upregulated in ASD brain, showed significant similarity to two modules identified in previous studies of normal human brain8: an astrocyte module and a microglial module.
T6	ACCURATE 14953 15217	The second module of co-expressed genes highly related to autism disease status, M16, was enriched for astrocyte markers and markers of activated microglia (Supplementary Table 9), as well as for genes belonging to immune and inflammatory GO categories (Figure 2).
