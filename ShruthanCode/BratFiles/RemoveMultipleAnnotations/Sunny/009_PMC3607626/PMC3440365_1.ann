T1	Context 264 479	A recent whole genome transcriptomic analysis of autism brain suggested candidate pathways in immune regulation and alternative splicing regulation in the temporal cortex, frontal cortex, and cerebellar vermis [13].
T2	ACCURATE 1856 2055	Remarkably, regional patterns of gene expression that typically distinguish frontal and temporal cortex are significantly attenuated in the ASD brain, suggesting abnormalities in cortical patterning.
T3	ACCURATE 11872 12136	These data suggest that typical regional differences, many of which are observed during fetal development10, are attenuated in frontal and temporal lobe in autism brain, pointing to abnormal developmental patterning as a potential pathophsyiological driver in ASD.
T4	ACCURATE 3214 3400	For each individual, we profiled three regions previously implicated in autism5: superior temporal gyrus (STG /Brodmannâ€™s area [BA] 41/42), prefrontal cortex (BA9) and cerebellar vermis.
T5	ACCURATE 3630 4017	We identified 444 genes showing significant expression changes in autism cortex samples (DS1, Figure 1b), and only 2 genes differentially expressed (DE) between the autism and control groups in cerebellum (Methods), indicating that gene expression changes associated with autism were more pronounced in cerebral cortex, which became the focus of further analysis (Supplementary Table 2).
