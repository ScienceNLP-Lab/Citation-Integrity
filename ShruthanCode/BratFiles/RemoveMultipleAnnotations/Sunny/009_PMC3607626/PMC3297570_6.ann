T1	Context 159 259	The analysis incorporated a previously published method [71], in a manner previously described [20].
T2	Context 0 158	Testing for the enrichment of low GWAS P-values was performed using the discovery cohort of a previously published GWAS [6], which included 943 ASDs families.
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 1931 2144	Moreover, using a published autism GWAS dataset, we show that the neuronal module is enriched for genetically associated variants, providing independent support for the causal involvement of these genes in autism.
T4	OVERSIMPLIFY 2145 2279	In contrast, the immune-glial module showed no enrichment for autism GWAS signals, indicating a non-genetic etiology for this process.
