T1	Context 1580 1721	This network analysis led to the identification of specific co-expression modules that are differentially expressed in ASD and controls [20].
T2	Context 1147 1433	A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of specific human brain regions (cerebral cortex, cerebellum and caudate nucleus) demonstrated that the transcriptome of the human brain is organized into modules of co-expressed genes that reflect different neural cell types [19].
T3	Context 1434 1579	Recently, this type of analysis was also applied to compare the expression profiles of three brain regions from autistic and control individuals.
T4	ACCURATE 2452 2599	Here, we demonstrate consistent differences in transcriptome organization between autistic and normal brain by gene co-expression network analysis.
T5	ACCURATE 2600 2799	Remarkably, regional patterns of gene expression that typically distinguish frontal and temporal cortex are significantly attenuated in the ASD brain, suggesting abnormalities in cortical patterning.
T6	ACCURATE 2800 3066	We further identify discrete modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism: a neuronal module enriched for known autism susceptibility genes, including the neuronal specific splicing factor A2BP1/FOX1, and a module enriched for immune genes and glial markers.
