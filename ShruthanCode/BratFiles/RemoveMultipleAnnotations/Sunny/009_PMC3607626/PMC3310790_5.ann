T1	Context 234 420	The comparison of findings between the present study and Voineagu et al. [20] demonstrates a consistent overlap involving several pathways including repair- and immune-related processes.
T2	ACCURATE 1291 1557	We further identify discrete modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism: a neuronal module enriched for known autism susceptibility genes, including the neuronal specific splicing factor A2BP1/FOX1, and a module enriched for immune genes and glial markers.
T3	ACCURATE 1683 1896	Moreover, using a published autism GWAS dataset, we show that the neuronal module is enriched for genetically associated variants, providing independent support for the causal involvement of these genes in autism.
T5	ACCURATE 6838 7155	Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (Methods) revealed that the 209 genes downregulated in autistic cortex were enriched for GO categories related to synaptic function, whereas the upregulated genes (N=235) showed enrichment for GO categories implicated in immune and inflammatory response (Supplementary Table 3).
T6	ACCURATE 21938 22153	Since immune molecules and cells such as microglia play a role in synaptic development and function26, we speculate that the observed immune up- regulation may be related to abnormal ongoing plasticity in ASD brain.
