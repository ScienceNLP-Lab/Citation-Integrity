T1	Context 204 466	The associations we uncovered in immune-related genes and the observed dysregulation of immune genes in ASD [13] suggest that variation in a limited number of immune-function genes may be responsible for observed up-regulation of their immune downstream targets.
T2	ACCURATE 1943 2077	In contrast, the immune-glial module showed no enrichment for autism GWAS signals, indicating a non-genetic etiology for this process.
T4	ACCURATE 21662 21983	We show that the transcriptome changes observed in ASD brain converge with GWAS data in supporting the genetic basis of synaptic and neuronal signaling dysfunction in ASD, while immune changes have a less pronounced genetic component and thus are most likely either secondary phenomena or caused by environmental factors.
T5	ACCURATE 21984 22199	Since immune molecules and cells such as microglia play a role in synaptic development and function26, we speculate that the observed immune up- regulation may be related to abnormal ongoing plasticity in ASD brain.
