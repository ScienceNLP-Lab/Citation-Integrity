T1	Context 0 100	A lack of enrichment of genetic associations in immune-related genes has recently been reported [13]
T3	ACCURATE 1943 2077	In contrast, the immune-glial module showed no enrichment for autism GWAS signals, indicating a non-genetic etiology for this process.
T4	ACCURATE 15020 15284	The second module of co-expressed genes highly related to autism disease status, M16, was enriched for astrocyte markers and markers of activated microglia (Supplementary Table 9), as well as for genes belonging to immune and inflammatory GO categories (Figure 2).
T5	ACCURATE 15285 15478	This module, which was upregulated in ASD brain, showed significant similarity to two modules identified in previous studies of normal human brain8: an astrocyte module and a microglial module.
T6	ACCURATE 21984 22199	Since immune molecules and cells such as microglia play a role in synaptic development and function26, we speculate that the observed immune up- regulation may be related to abnormal ongoing plasticity in ASD brain.
