T1	Context 260 440	The top 300 differentially expressed probes were used to generate a non-redundant gene list and compared with two published differentially expressed autism gene lists in brain [13]
T2	Context 459 606	There was a statistically significant overlap in the lists (P = 1.4E-9; Fisher’s exact test), notably including genes associated with inflammation.
T3	Context 607 798	While the role of neuroinflammation in autism pathophysiology remains unclear [34], our data emphasize the substantial interindividual heterogeneity of brain immune system gene dysregulation.
T5	ACCURATE 2275 2409	In contrast, the immune-glial module showed no enrichment for autism GWAS signals, indicating a non-genetic etiology for this process.
T6	ACCURATE 15352 15616	The second module of co-expressed genes highly related to autism disease status, M16, was enriched for astrocyte markers and markers of activated microglia (Supplementary Table 9), as well as for genes belonging to immune and inflammatory GO categories (Figure 2).
T7	ACCURATE 15617 15810	This module, which was upregulated in ASD brain, showed significant similarity to two modules identified in previous studies of normal human brain8: an astrocyte module and a microglial module.
T8	ACCURATE 21994 22315	We show that the transcriptome changes observed in ASD brain converge with GWAS data in supporting the genetic basis of synaptic and neuronal signaling dysfunction in ASD, while immune changes have a less pronounced genetic component and thus are most likely either secondary phenomena or caused by environmental factors.
T9	ACCURATE 22316 22531	Since immune molecules and cells such as microglia play a role in synaptic development and function26, we speculate that the observed immune up- regulation may be related to abnormal ongoing plasticity in ASD brain.
