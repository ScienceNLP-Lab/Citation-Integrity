T1	Context 282 436	We compared genes showing a main effect of diagnosis in the present study with differentially expressed genes implicated recently by Voineagu et al. [20].
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 2881 3268	We identified 444 genes showing significant expression changes in autism cortex samples (DS1, Figure 1b), and only 2 genes differentially expressed (DE) between the autism and control groups in cerebellum (Methods), indicating that gene expression changes associated with autism were more pronounced in cerebral cortex, which became the focus of further analysis (Supplementary Table 2).
