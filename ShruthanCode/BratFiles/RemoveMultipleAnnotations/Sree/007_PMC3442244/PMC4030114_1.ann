T1	Context 0 277	The DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium recently published the largest T2D GWAS meta-analysis to date (DIAGRAMv3), identifying many additional common variants associated with T2D and bringing the total number of independent T2D loci to 65 (12).
T2	MISQUOTE 9994 10605	Under a multiplicative model within and between variants, the sibling relative risk attributable to lead SNPs rose from λS = 1.093 at the 55 previously described autosomal T2D loci represented on Metabochip (DUSP9 on chromosome X is not captured) to λS = 1.104 after inclusion of the eight newly discovered loci (Supplementary Table 5). Assuming a T2D population prevalence of 8%, these 63 newly discovered and established autosomal loci together account for 5.7% of variance in disease susceptibility, as calculated by transforming dichotomous disease risk onto a continuous liability scale20 (Online Methods).
