T1	Context 0 231	The lead SNP (rs10811661) at this locus is downstream of, and closest to the lncRNA ANRIL (CDKN2B-AS1). The lead SNP for a putative secondary association signal (rs944801) is located within an intron of ANRIL (Morris et al., 2012).
T3	MISQUOTE 16291 17046	We detected two loci at which multiple independent association signals attained genome-wide significance: KCNQ1 (rs163184, P = 1.2 × 10−11; rs231361, P = 1.2 × 10−9; CEU r2 = 0.01) and CDKN2A/B (rs10811661, P = 3.7 × 10−27; rs944801, P = 2.4 × 10−9; CEU r2 = 0.01) (Fig. 2). Both signals at KCNQ1 have previously been reported in East Asian and European populations4,24. However, the secondary signal at CDKN2A/B, which maps to the non-coding CDKN2B-AS1 (ANRIL) transcript, has not previously been implicated in T2D susceptibility. This signal is independent of the previously reported haplotype effect at the primary T2D signal at this locus, which is itself likely due to the phase relationships between two clades of partially correlated variants25,26.
