T2	Context 0 214	The lead SNP at this locus is within the intron of the KCNQ1 protein-coding gene, yet the lead SNP for a putative secondary association signal is in the exon of an antisense lncRNA (KCNQ1OT1) (Morris et al., 2012).
T3	MISQUOTE 16890 17705	Both signals at KCNQ1 have previously been reported in East Asian and European populations4,24. However, the secondary signal at CDKN2A/B, which maps to the non-coding CDKN2B-AS1 (ANRIL) transcript, has not previously been implicated in T2D susceptibility. This signal is independent of the previously reported haplotype effect at the primary T2D signal at this locus, which is itself likely due to the phase relationships between two clades of partially correlated variants25,26. We also observed putative independent associations (P < 10−5) at DGKB (rs17168486, P = 5.9 × 10−11; rs6960043, P = 3.4 × 10−7; CEU r2 = 0.01) and MC4R (rs12970134, P = 1.2 × 10−8; rs11873305, P = 3.8 × 10−7; CEU r2 = 0.02). These results suggest that multiple independent association signals are widespread at T2D susceptibility loci.
