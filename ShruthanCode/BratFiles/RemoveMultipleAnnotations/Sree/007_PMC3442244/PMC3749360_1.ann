T0	MultiCitation 778 780	10
T1	Context 558 782	Of these SNPs, 66,000 were selected for efficient replication of top signals across multiple traits, with the hope that when tested in sufficiently large samples they might exceed genome-wide statistical significance (9,10);
T2	IRRELEVANT 1883 2039	Genome-wide analyses of these data are consistent with a long tail of further common variant loci explaining much of the variation in susceptibility to T2D.
