T1	Context 541 665	We identified 10 predominantly IRâ€“related SNPs by 1) their significant association with HOMA-IR (P < 0.05) in the MAGIC data
T2	MISQUOTE 26562 26947	Lead T2D SNPs at the remaining 24 loci were nominally associated with fasting glucose (P < 0.05), all with directionally consistent effects. These data extend previous reports indicating that the genetic landscape of pathological and physiological variation in glycemia is only partially overlapping, and are consistent with reciprocal analyses reported in the companion MAGIC paper34.
