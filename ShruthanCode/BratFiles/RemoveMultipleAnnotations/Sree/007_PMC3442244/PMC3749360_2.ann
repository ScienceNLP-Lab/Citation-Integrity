T2	Context 748 878	Interestingly, the G allele had been previously associated with increased risk of type 1 diabetes (11) but lower risk of T2D (10).
T3	ACCURATE 10960 11500	For comparison, we examined T2D association patterns in 2,707 independent replication SNPs for QT-interval, the trait showing weakest correlation with T2D susceptibility among those contributing to Metabochip and found far less directional consistency (54.4%, binomial test P = 3.3 × 10−6). This modest enrichment most likely reflects weak overlap of risk alleles between the two traits, since exclusion of SNPs mapping within 300 kb of directionally consistent T2D replication variants reduced this excess (52.5%, binomial test P = 0.060).
