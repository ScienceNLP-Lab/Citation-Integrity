T1	Context 270 518	In the present analyses, we updated these GRS  to include as many of the 65 index SNPs or their proxies as were available at the confirmed or newly identified loci from DIAGRAMv3 (12) (Table 1 and Fig. 1), using previously reported methods (4,9,16)
T3	MISQUOTE 10356 10967	Under a multiplicative model within and between variants, the sibling relative risk attributable to lead SNPs rose from λS = 1.093 at the 55 previously described autosomal T2D loci represented on Metabochip (DUSP9 on chromosome X is not captured) to λS = 1.104 after inclusion of the eight newly discovered loci (Supplementary Table 5). Assuming a T2D population prevalence of 8%, these 63 newly discovered and established autosomal loci together account for 5.7% of variance in disease susceptibility, as calculated by transforming dichotomous disease risk onto a continuous liability scale20 (Online Methods).
