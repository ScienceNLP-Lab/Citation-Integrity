T1	Context 164 402	We identified 20 predominantly β-cell–associated SNPs by 1) their significant effect on homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-β (β < –0.008; P < 0.05) in the most recent Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC)
T2	MISQUOTE 26949 27879	Second, we extended our previous analysis4 of the physiological consequences of T2D risk alleles to include the newly identified loci. We used the published MAGIC meta-analysis (up to 37,037 non-diabetic individuals) of HOMA indices of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity5 as these traits were not included in the enlarged Metabochip study34. The risk allele at ANK1 has features (nominally significant reduction in HOMA-B) indicating a primary effect on beta-cell function, whereas those at GRB14 and AKNRD55 are characteristic of loci acting primarily through insulin resistance (increased HOMA-IR) (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 10). The results for GRB14 are consistent with its broad impact on insulin-resistance related traits (described below), while at AKNRD55, these analyses point to MAP3K1, encoding MEK kinase, a key component of the insulin-signalling pathway, as the stand-out local candidate.
