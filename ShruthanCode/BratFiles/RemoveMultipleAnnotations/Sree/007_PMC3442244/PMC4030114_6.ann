T1	Context 265 447	The largest T2D GWAS meta-analysis to date (12) may include all of the common T2D-associated loci of at least modest effect size that can be expected to be specifically identified. I
T2	ACCURATE 1847 2479	Although the genetic contribution to T2D is well recognized, the current set of 56 established susceptibility loci, identified primarily through large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS)2–11, captures at best 10% of familial aggregation of the disease. The characteristics (effect sizes and risk allele frequencies (RAF)) of the variants contributing to the “unexplained” genetic variance remain far from clear. At the same time, difficulties in inferring biological mechanisms from the variants of modest effect identified by GWAS have inhibited progress in defining the pathophysiological basis of disease susceptibility.
