T2	Context 688 872	Subsequent models using genome-wide complex trait analysis suggested that 63% of T2D susceptibility might be attributable to common genetic variation in the full set of GWAS SNPs (12).
T3	MISQUOTE 12945 13216	Using simulations, based on parameter estimates from this mixture model, we estimated that 488 (95% confidence interval (CI) 456â€“521) of the independent replication SNPs, in addition to the 63 newly discovered and established loci, are associated with T2D susceptibility.
