T0	Citation 138 141	[1]
T1	Context 0 142	According to the most recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies, 63 individual SNPs have now been linked with diabetes risk [1].
T2	ACCURATE 10173 10447	Assuming a T2D population prevalence of 8%, these 63 newly discovered and established autosomal loci together account for 5.7% of variance in disease susceptibility, as calculated by transforming dichotomous disease risk onto a continuous liability scale20 (Online Methods).
T3	ACCURATE 11972 12174	Z-scores were calculated at a subset of 3,412 independent T2D replication SNPs (CEU r2 < 0.05), excluding the 63 established and newly discovered autosomal susceptibility loci represented on Metabochip.
