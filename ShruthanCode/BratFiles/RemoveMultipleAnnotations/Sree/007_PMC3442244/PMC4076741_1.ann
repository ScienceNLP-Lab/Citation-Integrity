T1	Context 792 1040	In a more recent large-scale meta-analysis which aimed to finely map the causal SNPs, only two of the 65 T2D susceptibility loci examined had a lead SNP resulting in a missense mutation (PPARG [rs1801282] and KCNJ11 [rs5215]) (Morris et al., 2012).
T2	MISQUOTE 9914 10525	Under a multiplicative model within and between variants, the sibling relative risk attributable to lead SNPs rose from λS = 1.093 at the 55 previously described autosomal T2D loci represented on Metabochip (DUSP9 on chromosome X is not captured) to λS = 1.104 after inclusion of the eight newly discovered loci (Supplementary Table 5). Assuming a T2D population prevalence of 8%, these 63 newly discovered and established autosomal loci together account for 5.7% of variance in disease susceptibility, as calculated by transforming dichotomous disease risk onto a continuous liability scale20 (Online Methods).
