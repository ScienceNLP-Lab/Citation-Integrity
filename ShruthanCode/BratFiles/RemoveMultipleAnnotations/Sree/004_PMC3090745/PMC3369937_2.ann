T1	Context 191 291	We obtained results of meta-analyses for the ADGC Stage 1+2 cohort (11,840 LOAD vs. 10,931 controls)
T3	MISQUOTE 2815 3834	To identify genetic variants associated with risk for AD, the ADGC assembled a discovery dataset [Stage 1; 8,309 LOAD cases, 7,366 cognitively normal controls (CNEs)] using data from eight cohorts and a ninth newly assembled cohort from the 29 NIA-funded Alzheimer Disease Centers (ADCs) (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, Supplementary Note) with data coordinated by the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) and samples coordinated by the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease (NCRAD). For the Stage 2 replication, we used four additional datasets and additional samples from the ADCs (3,531 LOAD cases, 3,565 CNEs). The Stage 3 replication used the results of association analyses provided by three other consortia (Hollingworth et al.12; 7,650 LOAD cases, 25,839 mixed-age controls). For Stages 1 and 2, we used both a meta- analysis (M) approach that integrates results from association analyses of individual datasets; and a joint analysis (J) approach where genotype data from each study are pooled.
