T2	Context 543 891	Examining the amount of genetic risk effect attributable to these genes (other than APOE), the most strongly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms at each locus have population attributable fractions between 2.72 and 5.97%, with a cumulative population attributable fraction for non-APOE loci estimated to be as much as 35% (Naj et al., 2011).
T3	MISQUOTE 5153 5644	In Stage 1, the strongest signal was from the APOE region (e.g., rs4420638, PM =1.1 × 10−266, PJ =1.3 × 10−253; Supplementary Table 5). Excluding the APOE region, SNPs at nine distinct loci yielded a PM or PJ ≤ 10−6 (Table 1; all SNPs with P < 10−4 are in Supplementary Table 5). SNPs from these nine loci were carried forward to Stage 2. Five of these had not previously been associated with LOAD at a genome-wide significance level of P ≤ 5.0 × 10−8 (MS4A, EPHA1, CD33, ARID5B, and CD2AP).
