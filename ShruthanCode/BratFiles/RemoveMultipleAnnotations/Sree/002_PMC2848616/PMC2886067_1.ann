T1	Context 736 839	In addition, Autophagy has been shown to protect neurons from Aβ induced cytotoxicity [44], [45], [46].
T2	ACCURATE 2057 2367	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
