T2	Context 213 444	On the other hand, mTOR inhibition could improve learning and memory functions, reduce tau pathology (Caccamo et al., 2010[13]), increase autophagy and decrease the amyloid β level in animal models of AD (Spilman et al., 2010[75]).
T3	ACCURATE 1685 2113	These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway can reduce Aβ42 levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice. As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
