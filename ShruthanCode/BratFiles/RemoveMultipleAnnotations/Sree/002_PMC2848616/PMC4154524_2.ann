T2	Context 432 633	In two independent mouse models of AD, rapamycin, through inhibition of mTOR signaling, rescued cognitive deficits by suppressing extracellular Aβ deposition and intracellular tau accumulation [45,63].
T3	ACCURATE 2676 3104	These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway can reduce Aβ42 levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice. As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
