T1	Context 634 876	Interestingly, this treatment induced autophagy marked by increased expression of Atg 7, Atg5-Atg12, decrease in p62, no modification of LC3 expression and controversial results surrounding LC3-II expression in PDAPP and 3xTg-AD mice [45,46].
T3	ACCURATE 19330 20459	In contrast, no differences in LC3-II/β-actin ratios were observed between control- and rapamycin-treated non-transgenic littermates ( Fig. 3a–b ), suggesting that rapamycin may induce autophagy as a response to high Aβ levels in hippocampi of transgenic PDAPP mice. During autophagy, LC3 redistributes to autophagosomes, which can be visualized as puncta in individual cells[19], [43], [44]. To determine whether the decreased LC3-II/β-actin ratios in hippocampi of rapamycin-treated PDAPP mice resulted from the induction of autophagic flux, we examined LC3 distribution, as well as levels of p62SQSTM, an ubiquitin-binding scaffold protein that is specifically degraded by autophagy[22], [45], in hippocampi of control- and rapamycin-treated PDAPP mice. LC3-immunoreactive puncta were increased in the projections of hippocampal neurons of rapamycin-treated PDAPP mice ( Fig. 3c–d ), suggesting that LC3 was redistributed to a vesicle-like compartment. Consistent with this observation, levels of the autophagosomal substrate p62SQSTM were significantly decreased in hippocampi of rapamycin-treated PDAPP mice ( Figure 3f–g ).

Phosphorylation of ULK1 and mAtg13 inhibits ULK1 activity.
