T1	Context 161 322	Furthermore, many studies have revealed that the stimulation of autophagy can reduce Aβ accumulation and alleviate memory deficits in transgenic AD mice [45-48].
T2	ACCURATE 1835 2145	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
