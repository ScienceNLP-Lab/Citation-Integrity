T1	Context 364 495	Accordingly, inhibition of mTOR activity induces autophagy, lessens the aggregates of Aβ, and enhances the process of Aβ clearance.
T2	ACCURATE 1715 2025	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
