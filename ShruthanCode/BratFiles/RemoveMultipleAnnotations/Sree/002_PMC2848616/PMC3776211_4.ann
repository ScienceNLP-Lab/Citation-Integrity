T1	Context 1185 1356	The strong effect of Rapamycin on these cellular functions also identifies mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effect of the drug in the transgenic model of AD [29].
T2	ACCURATE 15783 16345	To determine the mechanism by which rapamycin treatment abolishes AD-like cognitive deficits in transgenic PDAPP mice, we examined (a) mTOR activity and (b) the proteolytic processes that generate of Aβ in PDAPP mouse brains. Phosphorylation of the mTOR target p70S6K[6] was reduced in brains of both rapamycin-treated PDAPP mice and non-transgenic littermates, indicating that mTOR activity was inhibited ( Fig. 2a–c )[36], [37] in brains of both genotypes. Levels of Aβ42, but not of Aβ40, were reduced in rapamycin-treated transgenic PDAPP mice ( Figure 2d ).
