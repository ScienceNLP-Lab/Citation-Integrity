T2	Context 897 1034	In addition, mTOR inhibition that can lead to autophagy in murine models of AD has been shown to improve memory and limit Aβ levels [93].
T3	ACCURATE 1940 2251	Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of Aβ42, a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model. These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway can reduce Aβ42 levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice.
