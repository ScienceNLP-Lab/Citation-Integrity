T2	Context 631 770	Rapamycin induced inhibition of mTORC1 has also been shown to decrease beta-amyloid expression by increasing the rate of autophagy [18,29].
T3	ACCURATE 7137 7376	Thus, our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can lower AÎ² levels and slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease, possibly by stimulating autophagy.
