T1	Context 484 630	There is also evidence of an association between mTOR signalling and beta-amyloid, although the nature of the association is uncertain [18,28,29].
T2	ACCURATE 20368 21104	The data presented here are, to our knowledge, the first to show that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin decreased Aβ42 levels ( Fig. 2 ) and rescued cognitive function ( Fig. 1 ) in a mouse model of AD. Our data suggest that the reduction in Aβ42 levels and the improvement in cognitive function in rapamycin-treated PDAPP mice may be a consequence of the induction of autophagy in hippocampus ( Fig. 3 ) by high levels of Aβ in PDAPP transgenic brains. Consistent with a key role for high levels of Aβ in the activation of autophagy when mTOR activity is reduced, rapamycin did not induce autophagy in brains of rapamycin-treated non-transgenic mice, in which levels of endogenous Aβ are much lower than those in PDAPP transgenic brains.
