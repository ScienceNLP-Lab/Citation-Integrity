T1	Context 372 637	In contrast, Wyss-Coray and colleagues have shown that increasing autophagy induction decreases Aβ pathology in an animal model of AD [70]. Data in apparent contradiction to each other have been also reported by others [5], [29], [32], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75].
T3	ACCURATE 2766 3076	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
