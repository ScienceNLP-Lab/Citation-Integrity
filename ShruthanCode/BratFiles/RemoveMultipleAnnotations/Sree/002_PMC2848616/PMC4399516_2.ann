T2	Context 123 351	mTOR, an inhibitor of autophagy, decreases the Aβ clearance of the autophagy/lysosome system which accounts for the clearance of abnormal proteins.20,43 mTOR also modulates the metabolism of APP by regulating β- and γ-secretase.
T3	ACCURATE 3669 4247	mTOR also regulates autophagy through mTORC2. Active mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates Akt and PKC[15], [16]. Since Akt positively regulates mTORC1, phosphorylation of Akt by mTORC2 stimulates mTORC1 function, inhibiting autophagy. In addition, phosphorylated Akt blocks the activation of FOXO3, a member of the FOXO family of transcription factors that have a key role in lifespan extension in invertebrates. Among many targets, FOXO factors regulate expression of autophagy-related genes[17]. Thus mTORC2 activity indirectly inhibits autophagy through inactivation of FOXO3.
