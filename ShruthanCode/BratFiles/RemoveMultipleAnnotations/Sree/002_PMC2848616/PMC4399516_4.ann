T2	NOT_SUBSTANTIATE 5925 6412	Supporting the notion that autophagy may have a protective role in AD, deletion of the beclin 1 gene in PDAPP mice impaired autophagy and resulted in large increases in Aβ levels and accelerated Aβ deposition[26]. On the other hand, the endosomal-lysosomal system is a major site of Aβ production[27], [28] and it was recently demonstated that Aβ is generated during macroautophagy both in vitro and in vivo[19]. The role of the mTOR pathway and of autophagy in AD is thus still unclear.
