T1	Context 0 146	For LC3, no variation is observed in APPswePS1dE9 mice regardless of age compared to WT mice. Other authors show no modification of LC3-I [45,46].
T2	ACCURATE 18543 18809	In contrast, no differences in LC3-II/β-actin ratios were observed between control- and rapamycin-treated non-transgenic littermates ( Fig. 3a–b ), suggesting that rapamycin may induce autophagy as a response to high Aβ levels in hippocampi of transgenic PDAPP mice.
