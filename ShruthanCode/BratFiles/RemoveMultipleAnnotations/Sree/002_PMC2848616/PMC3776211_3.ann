T1	Context 996 1104	More recently in animal models Rapamycin has been found to be a good candidate for the treatment of AD [29].
T3	ACCURATE 7137 7496	Thus, our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can lower AÎ² levels and slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease, possibly by stimulating autophagy. Rapamycin, already used in clinical settings, may be a potentially effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.
