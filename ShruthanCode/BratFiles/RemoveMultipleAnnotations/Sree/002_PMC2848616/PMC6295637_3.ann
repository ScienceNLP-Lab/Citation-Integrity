T1	Context 0 365	The beneficial effects of EVR seen in this study are in accordance with some previous results from rapamycin, which is able to ameliorate age-dependent learning and memory impairments (Majumder et al., 2012[48]) and reduce cognitive deficits related to neurological disorders such as AD (Spilman et al., 2010[75]) and status epilepticus (Brewster et al., 2013[11]).
T3	ACCURATE 2172 2470	Our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease. Rapamycin, already used in clinical settings, may be a potentially effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.
