T1	Context 0 262	Rapamycin, a selective inhibitor of target-of-rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) and thus modulator of the mTOR pathway activity, improved learning and memory and reduced Aβ and tau pathology in the brains of AD mouse model (Caccamo et al., 2010; Spilman et al., 2010).
T3	ACCURATE 2182 2492	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
T4	ACCURATE 7367 7427	Rapamycin abrogates memory deficits in PDAPP hAPP(J20) mice.
T5	ACCURATE 10155 10229	Rapamycin inhibits mTOR and decreases Aβ42 levels in brains of PDAPP mice.
T6	ACCURATE 11361 11415	Rapamycin increases autophagy in brains of PDAPP mice.
