T1	Context 159 410	In contrast to inhibition of transcription, inhibition of translation by treatment with cycloheximide (CHX) prevents both the CCCP-dependent induction of PINK1 expression and Parkin translocation to CCCP-uncoupled mitochondria (Narendra et al., 2010).
T2	ACCURATE 42651 43041	Treatment of HeLa cells for 90 min with cycloheximide blocked the depolarization-induced accumulation of endogenous PINK1 in whole-cell lysates as well as in the mitochondria-rich membrane fraction (Figure 7A and 7B). A 90-min treatment with cycloheximide, likewise, blocked Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria by confocal microscopy (96.0±3.5% vs. 11.3±4.2%) (Figure 7C and 7D).
