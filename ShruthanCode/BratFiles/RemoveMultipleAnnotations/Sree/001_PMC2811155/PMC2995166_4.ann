T1	Context 1158 1532	This contrasts with our previous work using short hairpin RNAi targeting a different site in PARL mRNA that was interpreted to exclude PARL as a protease for PINK1 cleavage, likely owing to insufficient knockdown of endogenous PARL in HeLa cells and to insufficient expression of ectopic PINK1 in PARL knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; Narendra et al., 2010).
T2	ACCURATE 22998 23754	To examine whether the mammalian ortholog of Rhomboid-7, PARL, is responsible for PINK1 cleavage in mammalian cells, we tested whether PINK1-V5 accumulates in HeLa cells transfected with PARL shRNA and treated with CCCP. Although endogenous PARL could not be detected in HeLa cells, PARL shRNA inhibited expression of overexpressed PARL (Figure S2A and S2B). Knockdown of PARL did not appreciably change basal levels of endogenous PINK1 or augment the depolarization-induced accumulation of endogenous PINK1 in HeLa cells (Figure S2B). Likewise, PINK1-V5 levels were similar in PARL−/− and PARL+/+ MEFs, under basal conditions and following depolarization with CCCP (Figure S2C). Together, these results suggest that PARL is dispensable for PINK1 cleavage.
