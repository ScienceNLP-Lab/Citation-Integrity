T1	Context 833 1091	We and others have previously demonstrated that endogenous PINK1 behaves similarly to the overexpressed PINK1 counterparts in that PINK1 FL accumulates under valinomycin treatment and PINK1 Δ1 and Δ2 accumulate under proteasome inhibitor treatment [9,12,22].
T2	ACCURATE 16215 16602	We find PINK1 KD expression is regulated by mitochondrial voltage similarly to wild-type PINK1 (Figure S1D); but unlike wild-type PINK1, PINK1 KD does not enhance Parkin recruitment when overexpressed (as shown later). After treatment with paraquat overnight, we find that PINK1 KD accumulates selectively on depolarized mitochondria, in a pattern similar to wild-type PINK1 (Figure 1I).
