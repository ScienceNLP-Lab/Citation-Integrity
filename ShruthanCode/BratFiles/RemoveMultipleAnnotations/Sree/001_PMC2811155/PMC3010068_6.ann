T1	Context 229 439	The plasmids carrying shRNA sequences for DRP1, Mito-YFP, mCherry-Parkin, YFP-Parkin (wild type, R275W, C441R), and Mfn2-YFP have been described previously (Karbowski et al., 2007; Narendra et al., 2008, 2010).
T2	ACCURATE 50262 50469	As was reported previously, wild-type YFP-Parkin is recruited to mitochondria in the majority of HeLa cells (94.7±5.8%) by confocal microscopy, following treatment with 10 µM CCCP for 1 h (Figure 9A and 9B).
T3	ACCURATE 51753 51849	The recruitment of YFP-Parkin R275W was verified in a live-cell imaging experiment (Figure S8C).
T4	ACCURATE 50800 51111	Mutations in conserved cysteines of the RING domains (the patient mutations C253Y, C289G, and C441R and the engineered mutation C332S) completely disrupt recruitment at 1 h of CCCP treatment, as do mutations (patient mutation Q311X and engineered mutation T415X) that result in loss of RING2 (Figure 9A and 9B).
