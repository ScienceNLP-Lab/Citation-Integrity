T1	Context 0 183	Several studies reported that mitochondrial stress, such as exposure to membrane potential inhibitors, initiates the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway [14], [15], [16], [17], [20], [28].
T3	ACCURATE 58362 58604	That inhibition of PINK1 cleavage by mitochondrial depolarization up-regulates the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway also raises the possibility that inhibitors of PINK1's protease might up-regulate the pathway and have some therapeutic benefit.
