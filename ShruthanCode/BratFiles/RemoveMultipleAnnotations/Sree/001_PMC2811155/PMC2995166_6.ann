T1	Context 1223 1542	These results suggest that in contrast to FL, the CCCP-stabilized form of PINK1 that localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane facing the cytosol (Narendra et al., 2010), the 60-kD Î”MTS-PINK1, which appears in the absence of PARL, and the 52-kD PINK1 are protease-protected within polarized mitochondria (Fig. 1 d).
T2	ACCURATE 38431 38531	Stable expression of PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane is sufficient for Parkin recruitment.
