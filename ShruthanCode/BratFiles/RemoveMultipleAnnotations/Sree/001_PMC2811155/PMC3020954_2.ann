T2	Context 830 969	In turn, Parkin promotes the degradation of functionally impaired mitochondria through ubiquitination-dependent autophagy [11], [12], [13].
T3	ACCURATE 58009 58390	We recently reported that the Parkinson disease-linked E3 ubiquitin ligase, Parkin, is selectively recruited to dysfunctional mitochondria with low membrane potential to promote their autophagic degradation, suggesting that a deficiency of mitochondrial quality control may underlie the observed mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkin knockout Drosophila and mice [11]â€“[15],[17],[21].
