T1	Context 749 849	Under stress conditions, PINK1 recruits Parkin to dysfunctional mitochondria [14], [15], [16], [17].
T2	ACCURATE 2923 3250	The findings we report in this paper suggest a new model in which PINK1 and Parkin together sense mitochondria in distress and selectively target them for degradation. In this pathway, PINK1 acts as a flag that accumulates on dysfunctional mitochondria and then signals to Parkin, which tags these mitochondria for destruction.
