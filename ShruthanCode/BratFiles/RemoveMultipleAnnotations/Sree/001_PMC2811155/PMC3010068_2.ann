T2	Context 536 759	To achieve this, we applied two Parkin mutants: ParkinR275W, which translocates to depolarized mitochondria but fails to induce mitophagy; and ParkinC441R, which fails to translocate to mitochondria (Narendra et al., 2010).
T3	OVERSIMPLIFY 50994 51305	Mutations in conserved cysteines of the RING domains (the patient mutations C253Y, C289G, and C441R and the engineered mutation C332S) completely disrupt recruitment at 1 h of CCCP treatment, as do mutations (patient mutation Q311X and engineered mutation T415X) that result in loss of RING2 (Figure 9A and 9B).
