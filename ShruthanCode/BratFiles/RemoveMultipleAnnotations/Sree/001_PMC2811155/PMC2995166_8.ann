T1	Context 1547 1885	When we treated HeLa cells stably expressing YFP-Parkin with MG132 for 8 h to accumulate the 52-kD PINK1 (Fig. 1 c; Narendra et al., 2010), we detected no mitochondrial translocation of Parkin (Fig. 2 d), which is consistent with import and PARL-mediated cleavage of PINK1 in the inner mitochondrial membrane in the absence of uncoupling.
T2	MISQUOTE 20275 20526	When MG132 is added during the final hour of treatment in HeLa cells treated with vehicle, an âˆ¼52-kDa band appears, consistent with the cleavage product of full-length Parkin described in previous reports [22],[28],[30] (Figure 2A, lane 1 vs. lane 2).
