T2	Context 0 223	Previously examined Parkin mutations that occur in PD patients display a range of mitochondrial translocation activities but most fail to induce mitophagy (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010).
T3	ACCURATE 53965 54665	We assessed the ability of Parkin mutants to induce mitophagy. As we found previously [21], expression of wild-type Parkin in HeLa cells that do not detectably express endogenous Parkin completely eliminates mitochondria in greater than half of the cells (59.0±15.1%) following treatment with CCCP for 24 h (Figure 9D and 9E). Mutations in the UBL of Parkin exhibit a moderate loss in mitophagy activity (22.0±2.0% and 23.1±8.4% of cells exhibited no mitochondria for R42P and R46P, respectively); whereas mutations in the conserved cysteines of the RBR or truncations that resulted in loss of RING2 exhibit a severe mitophagy deficit (0±0% to 5.3±2.3%, depending on the mutation) (Figure 9D and 9E).
