T1	Context 2267 2362	PINK1 kinase activity is required for many Parkin functions and Parkin acts downstream of PINK1
T3	ACCURATE 34706 34983	Consistent with genetic studies in Drosophila, these findings show that Parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria and Parkin-induced mitophagy are downstream of PINK1 expression, whereas PINK1 accumulation in response to depolarization is upstream of Parkin recruitment.
T4	ACCURATE 35563 35760	Consistent with necessity of PINK1's mitochondrial localization and kinase activity, exogenous expression of PINK1 KD or PINK1 Î”N fails to accelerate the kinetics of Parkin recruitment (Figure 5B).
