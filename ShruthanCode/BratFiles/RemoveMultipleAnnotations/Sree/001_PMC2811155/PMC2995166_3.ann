T1	Context 684 871	whereas ectopic and endogenous PINK1 have been reported to span the outer mitochondrial membrane with the C-terminal kinase region facing the cytosol poised to induce Parkin translocation
T3	ACCURATE 22316 22527	Consistent with results from a recent study of PINK1's topology when it is ectopically expressed [22], we found that the kinase domain of endogenous PINK1 faces the cytosol following depolarization (Figure S1E).
