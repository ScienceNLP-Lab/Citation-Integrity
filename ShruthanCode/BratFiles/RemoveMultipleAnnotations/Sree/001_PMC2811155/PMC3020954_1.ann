T1	Context 725 817	PINK1 is required for recruitment of Parkin to mitochondria with impaired membrane potential
T2	ACCURATE 43575 43934	To verify that increased expression of PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane is sufficient to induce Parkin recruitment, we used a regulated heterodimerization system [40], in which the modified FRB domain was fused to PINK1 Î”1-110-YFP and the FKBP domain was fused to the outer mitochondrial membrane anchor of TOM20 (residues 1 through 33) (Figure S4A).
T3	ACCURATE 5220 5454	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps.
