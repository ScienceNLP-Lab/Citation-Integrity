T2	ACCURATE 6822 7168	In this model, mitochondrial PINK1 is rapidly turned over on bioenergetically well-coupled mitochondria by proteolysis, but is selectively stabilized on mitochondria with low membrane potential. Selective accumulation of PINK1 on the impaired mitochondria recruits Parkin, and Parkin, in turn, induces the degradation of the damaged mitochondria.
