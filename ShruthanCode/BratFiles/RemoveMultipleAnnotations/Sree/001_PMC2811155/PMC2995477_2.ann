T2	Context 586 769	While this functional role is unclear, several studies suggest a role of PINK1 in the mitochondrial fission/fusion pathway [26-28] and in mitophagy of damaged mitochondria [22,29-32].
T3	ACCURATE 7406 8317	Here, we show that full-length PINK1 accumulates selectively on dysfunctional mitochondria, and that Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria and subsequent Parkin-induced mitophagy are strictly dependent on PINK1's mitochondrial targeting signal and depolarization-induced accumulation. Together, these results strongly support a novel model for signaling between PINK1 and Parkin in response to mitochondrial damage. In this model, mitochondrial PINK1 is rapidly turned over on bioenergetically well-coupled mitochondria by proteolysis, but is selectively stabilized on mitochondria with low membrane potential. Selective accumulation of PINK1 on the impaired mitochondria recruits Parkin, and Parkin, in turn, induces the degradation of the damaged mitochondria. In this model, PINK1 and Parkin form a pathway for sensing and selectively eliminating damaged mitochondria from the mitochondrial network.
