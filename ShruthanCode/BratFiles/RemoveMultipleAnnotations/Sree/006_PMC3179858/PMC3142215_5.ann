T1	Context 594 720	Together, these studies suggested that SAMHD1 is the myeloid-cell specific HIV-1 restriction factor counteracted by Vpx [9,10]
T2	ACCURATE 1556 2521	Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1). Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein. Mutations in SAMHD1 cause Aicardi- Goutieres syndrome (AGS), a disease that produces a phenotype that mimics the effects of a congenital viral infection7,8. Failure to dispose of endogenous nucleic acid debris in AGS results in inappropriate triggering of innate immune responses via cytosolic nucleic acids sensors9,10. Thus, our findings reveal that macrophages are defended from HIV-1 infection by a mechanism that prevents an unwanted interferon response triggered by self nucleic acids, and uncover an intricate relationship between innate immune mechanisms that control response to self and to retroviral pathogens.
