T2	ACCURATE 10189 10591	We observed that wild type Vpx readily depleted endogenous SAMHD1 levels. In contrast, VpxQ76A, which is defective for DCAF1 binding12, did not decrease SAMHD1 levels. Importantly, the effect of Vpx was blocked when macrophages were exposed to the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prior to and during infection with Vpx-loaded SIV VLP (Figure 3b). We conclude that Vpx programs SAMHD1 for destruction in MDM.
