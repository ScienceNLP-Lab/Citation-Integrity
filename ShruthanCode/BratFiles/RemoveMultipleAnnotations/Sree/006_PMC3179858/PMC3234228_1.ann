T1	Context 342 570	Two recent publications identified Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) Domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) as the Vpx-sensitive restriction factor that inhibits HIV-1 infection of macrophages and dendritic cells [19], [20].
T2	ACCURATE 1394 1737	Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1). Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
