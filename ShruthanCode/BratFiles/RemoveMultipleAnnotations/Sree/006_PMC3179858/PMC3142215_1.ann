T2	ACCURATE 4978 5713	To identify Vpx-recruited substrates for the CRL4DCAF1 ubiquitin ligase, a proteomic screen was used to search for the cellular protein(s) that associate with the CRL4DCAF1 complex only in the presence of Vpx. Specifically, we directed the assembly of three sets of protein complexes in HEK 293T cells for their subsequent proteomic characterization (Figure 2a). First, to capture the cellular proteins bound by Vpx, we transiently expressed a functional SIVmac 239 Vpx protein tagged with FLAG- and HA- epitopes in tandem. Second, to trap proteins recruited by Vpx to CRL4DCAF1, we assembled quaternary complexes comprising HA-Cullin4, DDB1, DCAF1 and FLAG-Vpx, in cells transiently expressing epitope-tagged Cullin4 and Vpx subunits.
