T1	Context 487 669	It appears that only Vpx from the SIVsm/HIV-2 lineage counteracts SAMHD1-mediated HIV-1 restriction in myeloid cells [9,10], while HIV-1 Vpr does not interact or degrade SAMHD1 [10].
T2	ACCURATE 1677 2109	HIV-1 fails to transduce dendritic cells and has a reduced ability to transduce macrophages, due to an as yet uncharacterized mechanism that inhibits infection by interfering with efficient synthesis of viral cDNA3,4. In contrast, HIV-2 and related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVsm/mac) transduce myeloid cells efficiently owing to their virion-associated Vpx accessory proteins, which counteract the restrictive mechanism5,6.
