T1	Context 392 486	It might be possible that SAMHD1 acts in concert with another myeloid-specific co-factor [10].
T2	ACCURATE 17840 18285	One unanswered question is how myeloid cell specificity of SAMHD1-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infection is achieved? SAMHD1 is expressed in HEK 293T cells, undifferentiated THP-1 cells and other non-myeloid cell types that do not possess a Vpx-sensitive mechanism restricting primate lentivirus infection (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7). One possible explanation is that SAMHD1-mediated restriction may require a myeloid cell-specific molecule.
