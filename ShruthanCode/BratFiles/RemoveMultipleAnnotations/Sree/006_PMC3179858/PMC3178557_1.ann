T1	Context 1454 1704	Despite the fact that SAMHD1 is expressed in different cell types, it seems to restrict lentiviral infection specifically in myeloid cells, probably highlighting the need for a particular cellular context, or for specific cellular partners [59], [60]
T2	ACCURATE 18259 18704	One unanswered question is how myeloid cell specificity of SAMHD1-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infection is achieved? SAMHD1 is expressed in HEK 293T cells, undifferentiated THP-1 cells and other non-myeloid cell types that do not possess a Vpx-sensitive mechanism restricting primate lentivirus infection (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7). One possible explanation is that SAMHD1-mediated restriction may require a myeloid cell-specific molecule.
