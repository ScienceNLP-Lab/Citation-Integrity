T1	Context 425 593	Further analysis revealed that SAMHD1 blocks HIV-1 reverse transcription, as silencing SAMHD1 in THP-1 cells [9] and macrophages [10] increases the levels of viral DNA.
T2	ACCURATE 1556 1899	Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1). Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
