T1	Context 335 468	Recently, the human protein SAMHD1 was identified to be causative for the post-entry restriction of HIV-1 in myeloid cells [126,127].
T2	ACCURATE 2717 3060	Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1). Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
