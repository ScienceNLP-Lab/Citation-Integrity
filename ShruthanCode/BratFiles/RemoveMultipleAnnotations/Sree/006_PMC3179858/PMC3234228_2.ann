T2	Context 0 293	In this report, in addition to confirming independently the findings by Laguette et al. and Hrecka et al. [19], [20], we provide further evidence for the role of SAMHD1 as interferon-induced factor restricting HIV-1 replication in monocytes, the progenitors of macrophages and dendritic cells.
T3	ACCURATE 1680 2023	Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1). Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein.
