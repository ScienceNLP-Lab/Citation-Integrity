T1	Context 474 609	In macrophages and T cells, cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 digests escaped HIV-1 DNA that would otherwise trigger innate DNA sensing (42).
T3	ACCURATE 2048 2528	In Trex1−/− mouse cells and human CD4+ T cells and macrophages in which TREX1 was inhibited by RNA interference, cytosolic HIV DNA accumulated, and HIV infection induced type I IFN that inhibited HIV replication and spreading. TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway. HIV-stimulated IFN production in cells deficient in TREX1 did not involve known nucleic acid sensors.
