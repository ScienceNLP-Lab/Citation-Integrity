T1	Context 265 481	HIV achieves immune evasion in these target cells by exploiting the host DNase TREX1 (Yan et al., 2010), the most abundant exonuclease in mammalian cell (Hoss et al., 1999; Mazur and Perrino, 1999), to clear its DNA.
T3	ACCURATE 3646 3875	TREX1 is the most abundant 3′-5′ DNase in cells2. Treatment with TREX1 small interfering RNAs (siRNA) more profoundly inhibits HIV replication than siRNAs against other SET complex components, reducing viral production by a log2.
T4	ACCURATE 6579 6708	These results suggest that HIV-stimulated IFN-β production in Trex1−/− MEFs is activated by HIV DNA other than autointegrant DNA.
