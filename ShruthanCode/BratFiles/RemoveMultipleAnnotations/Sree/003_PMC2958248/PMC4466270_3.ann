T1	Context 169 432	To investigate this, we first analyzed the expression of SAMHD1 and TREX1 in cDCs after exposure to HIV-1; these host factors can affect HIV-1 RT products by reducing the synthesis of HIV-1 RT products [19–22] or enhancing their degradation [18,29], respectively.
T3	ACCURATE 38354 38605	One possibility is that TREX1 might sort productive vs non- productive HIV RT products. HIV RT is error-prone and often produces incomplete products. TREX1 recognizes ssDNA or dsDNA with single strand overhangs – the kind of DNA in failed RT products.
