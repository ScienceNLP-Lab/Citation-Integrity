T1	Context 0 145	There is now evidence that HIV-1 has the potential to stimulate the innate immune system through its RNA, DNA, and capsid [16], [34], [36], [37].
T2	ACCURATE 1387 1956	HIV introduces its single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome into a cell within the reverse transcription complex (RTC), which matures into the preintegration complex (PIC). The PIC delivers reverse-transcribed HIV DNA to the nucleus for chromosomal integration. Few copies of HIV DNA integrate, leaving behind HIV DNA in the cytosol to be cleared by host enzymes. Although nucleic acids within the RTC might be shielded from nucleic acid sensors, viral DNA within the PIC is accessible to exogenous endonucleases1 and thus potentially to cytosolic sensors of innate immunity.
