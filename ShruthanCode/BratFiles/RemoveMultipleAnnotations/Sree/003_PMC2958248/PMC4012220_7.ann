T1	Context 990 1209	Consequently, overall HIV-1 replication in which TREX1 expression is suppressed or ablated is reduced compared replication in normal cells, because DNA sensing results in expression of antiviral IFNs (Yan et al., 2010).
T2	ACCURATE 37640 37863	We validated all key findings in primary human cells, including HIV DNA accumulation, IFN induction and inhibition of HIV replication when TREX1 was inhibited by RNAi, and efficient rescue by co-suppressing IRF3 expression.
