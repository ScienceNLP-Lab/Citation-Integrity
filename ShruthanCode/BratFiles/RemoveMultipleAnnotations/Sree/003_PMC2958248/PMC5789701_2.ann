T2	Context 0 317	For our ssDNA and dsDNA stimulation experiments (Fig. 4d), mDCs from either HDs (n = 8) or ECs (n = 7) were cultured for 24 h in the presence of Poly I:C and 2 μg/mL of either ss- or ds-Gag DNA [41] that had been encapsulated into polymeric nanoparticles (TransIT-X2, Myrus) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
T3	MISQUOTE 17134 17537	TREX1 metabolizes reverse-transcribed HIV DNA and transfected ssDNA and dsDNA in both mouse and human fibroblasts. WT and KO MEFs or WT and TREX1 mutant (D18N) human fibroblasts were either infected with HIV or transfected with ssDNA and dsDNA gag sequence oligonucleotides (100 bp), and cytosolic DNA was measured by qPCR using gag primers 10 hpi or 3 h post transfection. *, P <0.01, Student's t-test.
