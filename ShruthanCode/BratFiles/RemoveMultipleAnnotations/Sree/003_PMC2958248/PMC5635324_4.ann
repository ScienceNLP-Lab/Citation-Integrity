T1	Context 614 721	In TREX1-depleted cells, escaped HIV-1 DNA is sensed by DNA sensor cyclic GMPâ€“AMP synthase (cGAS) (42, 43).
T2	ACCURATE 30638 31454	When TREX1 is inhibited by RNAi, HIV infection of primary cells triggers Type I IFN expression and secretion. The HIV-stimulated IFN response in cells deficient in TREX1, like the response to endogenous retroelement DNA and transfected DNA7, is IRF3-dependent. IFN induction can be blocked by expressing enzymatically active TREX1 or by simultaneously suppressing IRF3 expression to interrupt IFN signaling. HIV-stimulated innate immune signaling also requires the adaptor protein STING and the protein kinase TBK1. Based on siRNA experiments, none of the known DNA sensors is involved. Therefore our working model of the innate immune pathway activated by cytosolic HIV DNA starts with an unknown sensor (that may preferentially recognize ssDNA) that signals through STING, TBK1 and IRF3 to activate IFN expression.
