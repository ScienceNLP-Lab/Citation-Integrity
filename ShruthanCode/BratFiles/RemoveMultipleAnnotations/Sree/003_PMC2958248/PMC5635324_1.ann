T1	Context 0 355	Some of the earliest evidence that HIV-1 produces a stimulatory DNA PAMP during infection was obtained in human CD4+ T cells and macrophages that had been depleted for the cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 (42). In this study TREX1 was suggested to digest unencapsidated HIV-1 DNA that would otherwise activate a type I IFN response in a STING-dependent manner.
T2	ACCURATE 1751 2004	TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway. HIV-stimulated IFN production in cells deficient in TREX1 did not involve known nucleic acid sensors.
