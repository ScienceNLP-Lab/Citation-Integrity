T2	Context 2039 2242	It was demonstrated that in the absence of TREX1, a type I IFN response is induced that inhibits HIV replication and spreading, although the specific DNA sensor responsible remains to be identified [36].
T3	ACCURATE 2611 2831	Viral infection triggers innate immune sensors to produce type I interferons (IFN). However, HIV infection of T cells and macrophages does not trip these alarms. How HIV avoids activating nucleic acid sensors is unknown.
T4	ACCURATE 2895 3123	. In Trex1−/− mouse cells and human CD4+ T cells and macrophages in which TREX1 was inhibited by RNA interference, cytosolic HIV DNA accumulated, and HIV infection induced type I IFN that inhibited HIV replication and spreading.
