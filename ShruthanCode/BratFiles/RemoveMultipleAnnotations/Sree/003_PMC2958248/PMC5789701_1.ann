T1	Context 303 749	To address this, we incubated PBMCs from HDs or ECs simultaneously with a TLR3 agonist (Poly I:C) and single- or double-stranded HIV-1 Gag DNA (ssDNA or dsDNA, respectively) encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles (see “Methods”). A similar delivery vehicle has previously been shown to selectively activate cGAS- and STING-dependent immune recognition pathways, which are involved in innate immune sensing of HIV-1 during natural infection [41].
T2	ACCURATE 20546 21185	For further evidence that TREX1 is responsible for removing extraneous cytosolic HIV DNA, we assessed whether TREX1 interacts with HIV DNA during infection with wild-type HIVIIIB. Cytosolic extracts from HeLa-CD4 cells expressing FLAG-TREX1 infected with HIVIIIB for 10 h were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or IgG control antibody. The enrichment for HIV gag DNA and RNA in the precipitates was assessed by qPCR or qRT-PCR, respectively. The FLAG antibody immunoprecipitated 3-fold more HIV DNA than the IgG control, but there was no enrichment for HIV RNA, confirming that HIV DNA binds to TREX1 and is its preferred target (Fig. 4d).
