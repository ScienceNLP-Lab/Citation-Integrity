T1	MultiCitation 465 467	42
T2	Context 262 469	This stealthy replication is in part dependent on the cytoplasmic exonuclease TREX1, which degrades HIV-1 reverse transcripts that would otherwise be sensed by cGAS leading to a type I IFN response (33, 42).
T3	ACCURATE 1312 1690	In Trex1−/− mouse cells and human CD4+ T cells and macrophages in which TREX1 was inhibited by RNA interference, cytosolic HIV DNA accumulated, and HIV infection induced type I IFN that inhibited HIV replication and spreading. TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway.
