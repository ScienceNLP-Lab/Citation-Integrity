T2	Context 265 410	Overexpression of irisin in the liver of mice, via adenoviral delivery, increases energy expenditure and reduces high fat diet-induced obesity.67
T3	ACCURATE 1705 1892	Irisin is induced with exercise in mice and humans, and mildly increased irisin levels in blood cause an increase in energy expenditure in mice with no changes in movement or food intake.
T4	ACCURATE 3390 3662	Irisin is induced in exercise and activates profound changes in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, stimulating browning and UCP1 expression. Importantly, this causes a significant increase in total body energy expenditure and resistance to obesity-linked insulin-resistance.
