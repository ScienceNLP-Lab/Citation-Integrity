T2	Context 1896 2113	This suggests the existence of a crosstalk between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, as was recently shown with the identification of a new hormone, irisin, which stimulates browning and UCP1 expression in WAT [39].
T3	ACCURATE 2706 3009	Here we show that PGC1Î± expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of Fndc5, a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a new hormone, irisin. Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to stimulate UCP1 expression and a broad program of brown fat-like development.
