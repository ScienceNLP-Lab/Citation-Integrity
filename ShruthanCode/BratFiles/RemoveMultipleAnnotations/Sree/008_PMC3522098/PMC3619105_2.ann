T2	Context 562 739	These have been used to express a protein that is cleaved to the myokine irisin in skeletal muscle, and irisin was claimed to increase energy expenditure (Bostrom et al., 2012).
T3	ACCURATE 1645 1810	Here we show that PGC1Î± expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of Fndc5, a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a new hormone, irisin.
T4	ACCURATE 1949 2136	Irisin is induced with exercise in mice and humans, and mildly increased irisin levels in blood cause an increase in energy expenditure in mice with no changes in movement or food intake.
