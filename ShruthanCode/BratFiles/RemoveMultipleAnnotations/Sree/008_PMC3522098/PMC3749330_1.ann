T1	Context 119 308	There is increasing evidence that skeletal muscles express myokines, hormone-like factors that are released into the serum to function in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner (1–5).
T2	ACCURATE 2612 3032	This strongly suggests that PGC1α might stimulate the secretion of factors from skeletal muscle that affects the function of other tissues. In this paper, we show that PGC1α stimulates the expression of several muscle gene-products that are potentially secreted, including Fndc5. The Fndc5 gene encodes a type I membrane protein that is processed proteolytically to form a new hormone secreted into blood, termed irisin.
