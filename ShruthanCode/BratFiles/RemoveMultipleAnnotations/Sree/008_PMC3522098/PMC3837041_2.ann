T2	Context 0 368	PGC-1α and PRDM16 are transcriptional coactivators involved in the control of energy metabolism, and ectopic expression of PGC-1α and PRDM16 in WAT induces acquisition of BAT features, including expression of mitochondrial and fatty acid oxidation and thermogenic genes to limit weight gain and improve glucose intolerance in response to a high-fat diet (HFD) (20–23).
T3	ACCURATE 1945 2502	PGC1α (PPARγ coactivator-1 α) is a transcriptional coactivator that mediates many biological programs related to energy metabolism. Originally described as a coactivator of PPARγ that modulated expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and thermogenesis in brown fat1, it has also been shown to control mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism in many cell types. PGC1α is induced in muscle by exercise and stimulates many of the best known beneficial effects of exercise in muscle: mitochondrial biogenesis, angiogenesis and fiber-type switching2.
T4	ACCURATE 5980 6452	QPCR against brown fat and thermogenic genes in epididymal fat, classical brown fat (BAT) (a) and subcutaneous, inguinal (b) fat depots in MCK-PGC1α transgenics or littermate controls. N=7 for each group, repeated in a separate cohort with similar results. c, representative immunohistochemistry against UCP1 in the inguinal depot from indicated mice. d, western blot against UCP1 in the inguinal fat depot (n=3 and repeated in an independent cohort with similar results).
