T1	Context 886 1274	Advances have recently been achieved on identification of several transcriptional factors and coregulators that specifically promote development and acquisition of the BAT-specific gene expression profile, including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), PRDM16, peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) (18–20).
T2	ACCURATE 1436 1913	Exercise benefits a variety of organ systems in mammals, and some of the best- recognized effects of exercise on muscle are mediated by the transcriptional coactivator PGC1α Here we show that PGC1α expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of Fndc5, a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a new hormone, irisin. Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to stimulate UCP1 expression and a broad program of brown fat-like development.
