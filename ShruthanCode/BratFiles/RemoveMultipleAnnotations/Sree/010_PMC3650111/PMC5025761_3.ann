T1	Context 0 237	The effect of the microbiome on atherosclerosis, glucose homeostasis and adiposity has been attributed, in part, to circulating metabolites such as trimethylamine-oxide and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut bacteria2345720.
T3	ACCURATE 1244 1602	Intestinal microbiota metabolism of choline/phosphatidylcholine produces trimethylamine (TMA), which is further metabolized to a proatherogenic species, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Herein we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota metabolism of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis.
