T3	ACCURATE 3639 4214	Choline, a trimethylamine and part of the head group of phosphatidylcholine, is metabolized by gut microbiota to produce an intermediate compound known as trimethylamine (TMA) (Fig. 1a). TMA is rapidly further oxidized by hepatic flavin monooxygenases to form trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). TMAO was subsequently shown to be both proatherogenic and associated with cardiovascular risks.9 These findings raise the possibility that other dietary nutrients possessing a trimethylamine structure may also generate TMAO from gut microbiota and promote accelerated atherosclerosis.
