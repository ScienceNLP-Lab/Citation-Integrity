T1	Context 103 311	The gut microbiome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders such as diabetes1 and obesity2. The microbiome can also contribute to the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease3456.
T2	ACCURATE 1095 1269	Herein we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota metabolism of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis.
T3	ACCURATE 4027 4214	These findings raise the possibility that other dietary nutrients possessing a trimethylamine structure may also generate TMAO from gut microbiota and promote accelerated atherosclerosis.
