T2	Context 748 1022	Dietary L-carnitine and choline, compounds abundant in red meat, are metabolized into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by way of some normal gut commensals; in mice TMAO enhances atherosclerosis through disrupting cholesterol metabolism and foam-cell macrophage activity [145].
T3	ACCURATE 2210 2568	Intestinal microbiota metabolism of choline/phosphatidylcholine produces trimethylamine (TMA), which is further metabolized to a proatherogenic species, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Herein we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota metabolism of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis.
