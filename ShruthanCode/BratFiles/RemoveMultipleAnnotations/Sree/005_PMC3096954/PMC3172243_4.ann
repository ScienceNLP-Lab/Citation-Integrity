T1	Context 727 869	The MDA-MB-231 cell line used in this study was originally described as Basal B and has been recently characterized as Claudin-low [20], [21].
T2	ACCURATE 24993 26081	We identified those genes whose expression distinguished each human tumor subtype using significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) in our UNC337 tumor database, including a list defining the normal breast-like group (Figure 2a). These nine cell lines (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, Hs578T, BT549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM1315MO2, SUM159PT and HBL100) showed a gene expression pattern similar to the claudin-low tumor subtype with the lowest expression of genes involved in epithelial cell-cell adhesion (i.e., E-cadherin and claudins 3, 4 and 7), luminal differentiation (i.e., CD24, EpCAM) and high values for the CD44/CD24 and CD49f/EpCAM mRNA ratios (Figure S4, Table S3 in Additional file 1). To complement these clustering analyses, we developed a claudin-low centroid- based predictor using the UNC337 tumor data set and the SigClust-defined claudin-low group versus all others, and objectively classified the 52 cell lines as claudin-low or not; as expected, the human tumor-based claudin-low predictor identified these nine cell lines as claudin-low (Figure S5 in Additional file 1).
