T1	Context 0 174	Recent advances in the field suggest that breast tumors belonging to the claudin-low and basal-like intrinsic subtypes are particularly enriched in TIC cell signatures [6,7].
T2	ACCURATE 4171 4715	More recently, a tumor initiating cell (TIC) genomic signature derived from CD44+/CD24-/low-sorted cells and mammospheres obtained from primary human breast tumors was found to be exclusively enriched by gene expression in the claudin-low subtype [6,7], and the expression of this CD44+/CD24-/low/claudin-low profile increased in posttreatment samples after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormone therapy [7]. Overall, these studies suggest that the claudin-low tumor subtype lacks common epithelial cell features and is enriched for TIC features.
