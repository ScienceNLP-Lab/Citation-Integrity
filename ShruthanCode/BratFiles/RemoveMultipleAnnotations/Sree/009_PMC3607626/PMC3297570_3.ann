T1	Context 0 158	Differences in transcriptome organization between autistic and normal brain have been recently reported, including a neuronal module associated with ASD [20].
T3	ACCURATE 1152 1299	Here, we demonstrate consistent differences in transcriptome organization between autistic and normal brain by gene co-expression network analysis.
T4	ACCURATE 1500 1766	We further identify discrete modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism: a neuronal module enriched for known autism susceptibility genes, including the neuronal specific splicing factor A2BP1/FOX1, and a module enriched for immune genes and glial markers.
