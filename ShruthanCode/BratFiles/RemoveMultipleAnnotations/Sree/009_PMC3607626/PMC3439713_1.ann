T2	ACCURATE 21432 21815	GWAS set enrichment analysis using the discovery AGRE cohort from Wang et al.27 For each gene set (DE genes, M12 and M16) the null distribution of the enrichment score generated by 10000 random permutations is shown (x-axis) and the enrichment score for the gene set is depicted by a red vertical line. A p value < 0.01 was considered significant to correct for multiple comparisons.
