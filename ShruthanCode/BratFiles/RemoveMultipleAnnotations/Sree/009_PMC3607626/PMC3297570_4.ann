T1	Context 159 429	To study how the enrichment of rare and common variants corresponded to this study, we tested the overlap between the neuronal modules obtained in our study and the neuronal module that was previously shown to be differentially expressed between cases and controls [20].
T2	ACCURATE 8052 8253	Hierarchical clustering of DS2 samples based on either the top 200 genes DE in the initial cohort or the 81 overlapping genes showed distinct separation of cases from controls (Supplementary Figure 6).
