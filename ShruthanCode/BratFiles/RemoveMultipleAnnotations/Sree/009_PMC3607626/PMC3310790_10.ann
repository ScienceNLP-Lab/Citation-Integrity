T1	Context 0 242	Unique ProbeIDs of differentially expressed in the ‘initial’ dataset from Voineagu et al. [20] (file = ‘nature10110-s3.xls’) were compared with the differential expression gene list in the present study comparing all autism and control cases.
T2	ACCURATE 2791 3153	We identified 444 genes showing significant expression changes in autism cortex samples (DS1, Figure 1b), and only 2 genes differentially expressed (DE) between the autism and control groups in cerebellum (Methods), indicating that gene expression changes associated with autism were more pronounced in cerebral cortex, which became the focus of further analysis
