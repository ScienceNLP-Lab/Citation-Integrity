T1	Context 264 478	A recent whole genome transcriptomic analysis of autism brain suggested candidate pathways in immune regulation and alternative splicing regulation in the temporal cortex, frontal cortex, and cerebellar vermis [13]
T2	ACCURATE 3214 4017	For each individual, we profiled three regions previously implicated in autism5: superior temporal gyrus (STG /Brodmannâ€™s area [BA] 41/42), prefrontal cortex (BA9) and cerebellar vermis. After filtering for high-quality array data (Methods), we retained 58 cortex samples (29 autism, 29 controls) and 21 cerebellum samples (11 autism, 10 controls) for further analysis (see Methods for detailed sample description). We identified 444 genes showing significant expression changes in autism cortex samples (DS1, Figure 1b), and only 2 genes differentially expressed (DE) between the autism and control groups in cerebellum (Methods), indicating that gene expression changes associated with autism were more pronounced in cerebral cortex, which became the focus of further analysis (Supplementary Table 2).
