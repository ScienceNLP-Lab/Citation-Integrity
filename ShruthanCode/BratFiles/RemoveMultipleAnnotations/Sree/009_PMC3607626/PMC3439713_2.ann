T2	Context 0 301	The lack of an enrichment of significant associations in immune genes corroborates the findings by Voineagu et al.[13], who used a complimentary approach to test for evidence of a genetic component for the up-regulation of immune response genes in the autistic brain using the same AGRE genotype data.
T3	ACCURATE 20224 20607	GWAS set enrichment analysis using the discovery AGRE cohort from Wang et al.27 For each gene set (DE genes, M12 and M16) the null distribution of the enrichment score generated by 10000 random permutations is shown (x-axis) and the enrichment score for the gene set is depicted by a red vertical line. A p value < 0.01 was considered significant to correct for multiple comparisons.
T4	ACCURATE 20708 20965	Enrichment p values are shown for an autism GWAS dataset (Wang et al.27, AGRE discovery cohort) as well as two control datasets consisting of GWAS studies of non-psychiatric traits: Han et al.23 (Negative control 1) and Cooper et al.24 (Negative control 2).
