T1	ACCURATE 26914 27223	The risk allele at ANK1 has features (nominally significant reduction in HOMA-B) indicating a primary effect on beta-cell function, whereas those at GRB14 and AKNRD55 are characteristic of loci acting primarily through insulin resistance (increased HOMA-IR) (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 10).
