T10	Context 270 453	In the present analyses, we updated these GRS  to include as many of the 65 index SNPs or their proxies as were available at the confirmed or newly identified loci from DIAGRAMv3 (12)
T3	MISQUOTE 11187 11497	Figure 1 presents the distribution of Z-scores from Stage 2, aligned to the risk allele from Stage 1, at a subset of 3,412 independent (CEU r2 < 0.05) T2D replication variants that excludes lead SNPs and possible proxies (CEU r2 ≥ 0.1) at the 63 newly discovered and established loci represented on Metabochip.
T4	MISQUOTE 13307 13579	Using simulations, based on parameter estimates from this mixture model, we estimated that 488 (95% confidence interval (CI) 456–521) of the independent replication SNPs, in addition to the 63 newly discovered and established loci, are associated with T2D susceptibility. 
T5	MISQUOTE 10693 10967	Assuming a T2D population prevalence of 8%, these 63 newly discovered and established autosomal loci together account for 5.7% of variance in disease susceptibility, as calculated by transforming dichotomous disease risk onto a continuous liability scale20 (Online Methods).
