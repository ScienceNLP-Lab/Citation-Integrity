T0	MultiCitation 533 535	35
T2	Context 420 614	Currently, over 60 common risk variants have been identified [30–34], with a combined disease risk of 5–10% [34, 35], suggesting the existence of many more as yet undiscovered loci [34, 36, 37].
T1	ACCURATE 9801 10075	Assuming a T2D population prevalence of 8%, these 63 newly discovered and established autosomal loci together account for 5.7% of variance in disease susceptibility, as calculated by transforming dichotomous disease risk onto a continuous liability scale20 (Online Methods).
