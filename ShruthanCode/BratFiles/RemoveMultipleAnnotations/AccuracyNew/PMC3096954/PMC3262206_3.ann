T15	Context 531 823	To estimate the expression of the OTBC signature across the intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer, we calculated the mean expression of both gene lists (that is, up- and downregulated) in the entire median-centered UNC337 dataset (n = 327) by using the subtype calls described in [6].
T1	ACCURATE 1143 1344	In breast cancer, gene expression analyses have defined five tumor subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like and claudin-low), each of which has unique biologic and prognostic features.
T2	ACCURATE 3071 3316	Genomic studies have established four major breast cancer intrinsic subtypes (luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like) and a normal breast-like group that show significant differences in incidence, survival and response to therapy [1-3].
