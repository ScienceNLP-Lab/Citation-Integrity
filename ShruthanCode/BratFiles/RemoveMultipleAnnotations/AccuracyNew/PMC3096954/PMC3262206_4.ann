T16	Context 192 290	High CD44high/CD24- ratios have been associated with the claudin-low breast cancer subtype [6,11].
T1	ACCURATE 4283 4689	More recently, a tumor initiating cell (TIC) genomic signature derived from CD44+/CD24-/low-sorted cells and mammospheres obtained from primary human breast tumors was found to be exclusively enriched by gene expression in the claudin-low subtype [6,7], and the expression of this CD44+/CD24-/low/claudin-low profile increased in posttreatment samples after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormone therapy [7].
