T2	Context 472 574	Recently, a subgroup of Basal-like tumors associated with poor prognosis has also been reported [4,5].
T1	ACCURATE 772 1062	In breast cancer, gene expression analyses have defined five tumor subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like and claudin-low), each of which has unique biologic and prognostic features. Here, we comprehensively characterize the recently identified claudin-low tumor subtype.
T3	ACCURATE 1651 1954	Clinically, the majority of claudin-low tumors are poor prognosis estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (triple negative) invasive ductal carcinomas with a high frequency of metaplastic and medullary differentiation.
T4	ACCURATE 31717 32078	In terms of prognosis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that claudin-low tumors have a worse prognosis compared to luminal A tumors in both the UNC337 (hazard ratio [HR] of 2.83 and 5.66 for relapse-free survival [RFS] and overall survival [OS], respectively; P < 0.05) and NKI295 data sets (HR of 4.71 and 17.98 for RFS and OS, respectively; P < 0.001).
T5	ACCURATE 32079 32261	Conversely, similar survival curves were observed between claudin-low tumors and the other poor prognosis subtypes such as luminal B, HER2-enriched and basal-like tumors (Figure 3b).
T6	ACCURATE 34082 34269	These findings suggest that claudin-low tumors show some chemotherapy sensitivity but overall have a poor prognosis and may not be managed effectively with existing chemotherapy regimens.
