T9	Context 239 520	Although a number of human tumor cell lines have been identified as sharing features of claudin-low tumors (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, Hs578T, BT549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM1315MO2, SUM159PT and HBL100), fewer claudin-low, murine mammary tumor cell lines have been established [7]
T1	ACCURATE 1107 1397	In breast cancer, gene expression analyses have defined five tumor subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like and claudin-low), each of which has unique biologic and prognostic features. Here, we comprehensively characterize the recently identified claudin-low tumor subtype.
