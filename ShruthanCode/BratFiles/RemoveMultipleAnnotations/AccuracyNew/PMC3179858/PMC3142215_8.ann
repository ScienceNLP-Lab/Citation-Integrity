T16	Context 618 669	HIV-1 Vpr does not interact or degrade SAMHD1 [10].
T1	ACCURATE 8948 9267	As a negative control we selected the Vpr accessory proteins of HIV-1 and SIVmac, because they are closely related to Vpx, sharing roughly 25% and 50% amino acid identity, and can load cellular substrate proteins onto CRL4DCAF1,(21) but, unlike Vpx, Vpr does not alleviate the inhibition of lentivirus infection in MDM.
T2	ACCURATE 9413 9501	SAMHD1 co-precipitated efficiently with both Vpx variants, but not with Vpr (Figure 2b).
T3	ACCURATE 9585 9739	SAMHD1 was co-expressed with wild type SIVmac Vpx, a VpxQ76A variant that does not bind DCAF1, or HIV-1 Vpr that does not bind SAMHD1, in HEK 293T cells.
