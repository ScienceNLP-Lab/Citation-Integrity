T3	Context 469 612	Viral particle-associated Vpx protein induces a proteasome-dependent degradation of SAMHD1 in the target cell very early after entry [126,127].
T2	ACCURATE 2858 3061	Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein. 
T4	ACCURATE 18 21	Vpx
T5	ACCURATE 17095 17292	The Vpx accessory protein of HIV-2/SIVsm lineage viruses removes this inhibition by targeting SAMHD1 for proteasome-dependent degradation via CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase (Supplementary Figure 5).
