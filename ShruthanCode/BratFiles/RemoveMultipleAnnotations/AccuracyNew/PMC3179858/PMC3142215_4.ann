T12	Context 425 593	Further analysis revealed that SAMHD1 blocks HIV-1 reverse transcription, as silencing SAMHD1 in THP-1 cells [9] and macrophages [10] increases the levels of viral DNA.
T2	ACCURATE 15802 15933	In summary, our results show that SAMHD1 interferes with HIV infection of macrophages by preventing efficient viral cDNA synthesis.
T1	ACCURATE 15934 16131	The Vpx accessory protein of HIV-2/SIVsm lineage viruses removes this inhibition by targeting SAMHD1 for proteasome-dependent degradation via CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase (Supplementary Figure 5).
T4	ACCURATE 16547 16749	Our discovery that the SAMHD1 protein inhibits HIV infection in macrophages unveils a novel and unexpected link between unconventional cell-intrinsic innate immune mechanisms and the anti-viral defence.
T5	ACCURATE 14130 14328	Specifically, it can be clearly seen that the “early” (“E”) vs. “late” (“L”) cDNA PCR readouts showed selective repression of “late” reverse transcription products at high but not low SAMHD1 levels.
