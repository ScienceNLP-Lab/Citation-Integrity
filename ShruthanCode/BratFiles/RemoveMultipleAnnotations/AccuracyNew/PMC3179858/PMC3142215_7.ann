T15	Context 487 610	It appears that only Vpx from the SIVsm/HIV-2 lineage counteracts SAMHD1-mediated HIV-1 restriction in myeloid cells [9,10]
T1	ACCURATE 1895 2109	In contrast, HIV-2 and related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVsm/mac) transduce myeloid cells efficiently owing to their virion-associated Vpx accessory proteins, which counteract the restrictive mechanism5,6.
T2	ACCURATE 18507 18766	Of note, we observed that SAMHD1 levels are depleted by Vpx in both MDM and monocyte- derived dendritic cells in a Vpx glutamine Q76 dependent manner (data not shown) implicating SAMHD1 as the key AGS protein inhibiting lentivirus infection in myeloid cells.
