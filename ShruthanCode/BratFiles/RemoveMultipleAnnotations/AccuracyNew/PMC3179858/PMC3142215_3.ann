T2	MultiCitation 585 587	10
T11	Context 388 589	Both studies confirmed that Vpx interacts with SAMHD1 and induces proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1 in THP-1 cells or macrophages, which can be restored by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor [9,10].
T1	ACCURATE 659 747	Vpx relieves inhibition of HIV-1 infection of macrophages mediated by the SAMHD1 protein
T3	ACCURATE 15989 16145	Since HIV-2 and related simian viruses have evolved the Vpx function to counteract SAMHD1, they are able to infect macrophages much more readily than HIV-1.
T4	ACCURATE 8571 8715	Human epitope-tagged SAMHD1 was co-expressed with Vpx, or Vpr, in HEK 293T cells and Vpx/Vpr immune complexes were analyzed by Western blotting.
T5	ACCURATE 8716 8804	SAMHD1 co-precipitated efficiently with both Vpx variants, but not with Vpr (Figure 2b).
T6	ACCURATE 8888 9042	SAMHD1 was co-expressed with wild type SIVmac Vpx, a VpxQ76A variant that does not bind DCAF1, or HIV-1 Vpr that does not bind SAMHD1, in HEK 293T cells. 
T7	ACCURATE 9327 9449	We conclude that Vpx specifically binds to, and recruits SAMHD1 to the DCAF1-DDB1 module of CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase.
