T3	Context 1004 1238	SAMHD1 [158], like the exonuclease TREX1 [160] may be responsible for innate sensing of viral DNA, and viral targeting of SAMHD1 may possibly contribute to viral innate immune evasion, although this has not been specifically addressed
T4	ACCURATE 18896 19122	Whether SAMHD1 functions autonomously, what are the other key components of a putative SAMHD1 pathway, and what are the salient features of SAMHD1 that endow this protein with anti-HIV activity, requires further investigation.
T5	ACCURATE 17970 18087	One unanswered question is how myeloid cell specificity of SAMHD1-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infection is achieved?
T6	ACCURATE 15178 15326	This evidence clearly demonstrates that SAMHD1 inhibits MDM infection by HIV-1 and other primate lentiviruses by disrupting synthesis of viral cDNA.
