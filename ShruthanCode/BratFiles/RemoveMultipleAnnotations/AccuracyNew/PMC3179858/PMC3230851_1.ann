T2	Context 773 1003	Recent studies have identified a host SAM-domain HD-domain containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) as a target for Vpx-mediated proteosomal degradation, which overcomes a post-entry block to reverse transcription in myeloid cells [158,159].
T1	ACCURATE 2381 2584	Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome- dependent degradation of the protein. 
T3	ACCURATE 57 60	Vpx
T4	ACCURATE 16618 16815	The Vpx accessory protein of HIV-2/SIVsm lineage viruses removes this inhibition by targeting SAMHD1 for proteasome-dependent degradation via CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase (Supplementary Figure 5).
