T1	ACCURATE 21558 21774	In addition, rapamycin treatment did not induce autophagy and did not affect levels of endogenous Aβ in non-transgenic mice, suggesting that autophagy may have a key role in reducing Aβ42 in transgenic PDAPP brains. 
T3	ACCURATE 2775 3085	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
