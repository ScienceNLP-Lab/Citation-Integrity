#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	Information can be collected from title of paper/does not offer any further insight outside of title information.
T2	ACCURATE 22162 22501	Although the differences in performance between control-fed and rapamycin-fed non- transgenic groups were not significant, they may suggest that changes in pathways different from autophagy (such as effects on the regulation of protein synthesis) as a result of long-term mTOR inhibition may have a positive effect on learning and memory.
