T7	Context 634 876	Interestingly, this treatment induced autophagy marked by increased expression of Atg 7, Atg5-Atg12, decrease in p62, no modification of LC3 expression and controversial results surrounding LC3-II expression in PDAPP and 3xTg-AD mice [45,46].
T1	ACCURATE 19330 19596	In contrast, no differences in LC3-II/β-actin ratios were observed between control- and rapamycin-treated non-transgenic littermates ( Fig. 3a–b ), suggesting that rapamycin may induce autophagy as a response to high Aβ levels in hippocampi of transgenic PDAPP mice.
T3	ACCURATE 19122 19329	In agreement with the expected induction of autophagy by rapamycin-mediated inhibition of mTOR, LC3-II/β-actin ratios in hippocampi of rapamycin-treated PDAPP mice were significantly decreased ( Fig. 3a–b ).
