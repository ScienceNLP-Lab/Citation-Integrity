T5	Context 631 770	Rapamycin induced inhibition of mTORC1 has also been shown to decrease beta-amyloid expression by increasing the rate of autophagy [18,29].
T2	ACCURATE 2322 2632	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
T3	ACCURATE 20175 20366	Taken together, our results suggest that autophagy is induced by rapamycin-mediated mTOR inhibition specifically as a response to high Aβ levels in hippocampi of rapamycin-treated PDAPP mice.
