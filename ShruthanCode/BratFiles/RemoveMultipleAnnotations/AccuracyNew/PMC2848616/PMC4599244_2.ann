T2	ACCURATE 3593 3903	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.
T4	ACCURATE 24059 24260	In summary, our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin[5], an intervention that extends lifespan in mice[5], [6], can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease.
