T12	Context 138 274	proteosome-independent proteolysis yields a 52-kD form of PINK1 that is subsequently degraded by the proteosome (Narendra et al., 2010).
T1	ACCURATE 16559 16755	Full- length PINK1 (∼63 kDa), which is anchored in the mitochondrial membrane, is proteolytically cleaved into an ∼52-kDa cytosolic fragment that can be degraded by the proteasome [22],[28]–[30]. 
T2	ACCURATE 19069 19320	When MG132 is added during the final hour of treatment in HeLa cells treated with vehicle, an ∼52-kDa band appears, consistent with the cleavage product of full-length Parkin described in previous reports [22],[28],[30] (Figure 2A, lane 1 vs. lane 2).
T3	ACCURATE 19996 20285	Taken together, these results support a two-step model for the processing of PINK1: first, full-length PINK1 is cleaved into the ∼52-kDa short form in a voltage-dependent, proteasome-independent manner, and second, the short form of PINK1 is rapidly degraded by the proteasome (Figure 2B).
T5	ACCURATE 56050 56347	Full-length mitochondrial PINK1 (∼63 kDa) is cleaved into a short ∼52-kDa form, but the short, primarily cytosolic form is unstable, raising the questions: why is PINK1 found both on the mitochondria and in the cytosol, and which form of PINK1 is active in the PINK1/Parkin pathway [22],[28]–[30].
T6	ACCURATE 57292 57517	Although the intramembrane serine protease Rhomboid-7 appears to be required for PINK1 cleavage in Drosophila [31], our results suggest that PARL, its mammalian ortholog, is not required for PINK1 cleavage in mammalian cells.
