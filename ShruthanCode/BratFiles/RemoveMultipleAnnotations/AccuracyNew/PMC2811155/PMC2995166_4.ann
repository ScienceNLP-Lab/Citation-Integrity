T11	Context 1339 1532	owing to insufficient knockdown of endogenous PARL in HeLa cells and to insufficient expression of ectopic PINK1 in PARL knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; Narendra et al., 2010).
T1	ACCURATE 23219 23356	Although endogenous PARL could not be detected in HeLa cells, PARL shRNA inhibited expression of overexpressed PARL (Figure S2A and S2B).
T2	ACCURATE 12743 12950	We found that the ∼63-kDa band increases following CCCP treatment in control shRNA cells, but does not increase in the PINK1 shRNA cells, demonstrating that this ∼63-kDa band is endogenous PINK1 (Figure 1B).
T4	ACCURATE 24244 24412	Endogenous PINK1 accumulates similarly in HeLa cells, which display little or no endogenous Parkin expression, and HeLa cells stably expressing YFP-Parkin (Figure S2D).
T5	ACCURATE 33735 33830	These data suggest that PINK1 promotes mitophagy in the context of endogenous levels of Parkin.
T6	ACCURATE 54288 54551	As we found previously [21], expression of wild-type Parkin in HeLa cells that do not detectably express endogenous Parkin completely eliminates mitochondria in greater than half of the cells (59.0±15.1%) following treatment with CCCP for 24 h (Figure 9D and 9E).
