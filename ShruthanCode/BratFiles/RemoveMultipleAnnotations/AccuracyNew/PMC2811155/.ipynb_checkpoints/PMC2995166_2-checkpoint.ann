T9	Context 62 382	Although endogenous PINK1 protein expression is constitutively low owing to rapid turnover, PINK1 proteolysis is inhibited by mitochondrial uncoupling, allowing a robust increase in expression when a mitochondrion is damaged and loses membrane potential (Lin and Kang, 2008; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010).
T2	AccurateSeg 2255 2524	Here, we show that expression of PINK1 on individual mitochondria is regulated by voltage- dependent proteolysis to maintain low levels of PINK1 on healthy, polarized mitochondria, while facilitating the rapid accumulation of PINK1 on mitochondria that sustain damage. 
T3	AccurateSeg 7902 8099	In this model, mitochondrial PINK1 is rapidly turned over on bioenergetically well-coupled mitochondria by proteolysis, but is selectively stabilized on mitochondria with low membrane potential. Se
T4	AccurateSeg 38324 38511	However, OPA3-PINK1 Δ1-110-YFP, which does not display voltage dependent proteolysis, recruits mCherry-Parkin to mitochondria in 98±1.8% of cells in the absence of CCCP (Figure 6D and 6E)
T5	AccurateSeg 55929 56155	This selective accumulation is achieved by a novel mechanism, in which PINK1 is constitutively synthesized and imported into all mitochondria, but cleaved from healthy mitochondria by voltage-sensitive proteolysis (Figure S9).
T6	AccurateSeg 8988 9105	Remarkably, levels of endogenous mitochondrial PINK1 respond robustly to changes in mitochondrial membrane potential.
