T3	Context 966 1122	PINK1 recruits Parkin to mitochondria via its kinase activity (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010; Vives-Bauza et al., 2010).
T1	ACCURATE 3682 3841	In this pathway, PINK1 acts as a flag that accumulates on dysfunctional mitochondria and then signals to Parkin, which tags these mitochondria for destruction.
T2	ACCURATE 25377 25505	A kinase-deficient (KD) version of PINK1 [28] also failed to reconstitute Parkin recruitment to mitochondria (Figure 3A and 3B).
