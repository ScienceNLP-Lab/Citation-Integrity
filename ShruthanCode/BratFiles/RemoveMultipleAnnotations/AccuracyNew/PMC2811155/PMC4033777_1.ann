T3	Context 407 943	When targeted to healthy mitochondria, PINK1 is partially translocated across the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes, cleaved by several enzymes including the matrix-localized mitochondrial-processing peptidase MPP and the inner membrane protease PARL, released back into the cytosol, and rapidly degraded by the proteasome via the N-end rule pathway (Fig. 3 C; Jin et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010b; Deas et al., 2011; Meissner et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2011; Greene et al., 2012; Yamano and Youle, 2013).
