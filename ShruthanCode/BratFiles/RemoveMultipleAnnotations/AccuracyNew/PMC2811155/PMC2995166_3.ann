T10	Context 692 915	ectopic and endogenous PINK1 have been reported to span the outer mitochondrial membrane with the C-terminal kinase region facing the cytosol poised to induce Parkin translocation (Zhou et al., 2008; Narendra et al., 2010).
T1	ACCURATE 22316 22527	Consistent with results from a recent study of PINK1's topology when it is ectopically expressed [22], we found that the kinase domain of endogenous PINK1 faces the cytosol following depolarization (Figure S1E).
T3	ACCURATE 33549 33644	These data suggest that PINK1 promotes mitophagy in the context of endogenous levels of Parkin.
T4	ACCURATE 2089 2189	Parkin is selectively recruited from the cytosol to damaged mitochondria to trigger their autophagy.
T5	ACCURATE 57163 57466	Our results suggest that full-length mitochondrial PINK1 is the active form in the PINK1/Parkin pathway, and that cleavage of PINK1 into an unstable cytosolic form maintains low levels of PINK1 on healthy mitochondria in order to suppress the PINK1/Parkin pathway in the absence of mitochondrial damage.
T6	ACCURATE 29774 29976	Parkin-dependent mitophagy is reconstituted by exogenous PINK1 expression in the PINK−/− MEFs, with 65.5±5.0% of reconstituted PINK−/− cells displaying undetectable mitochondria following CCCP treatment
