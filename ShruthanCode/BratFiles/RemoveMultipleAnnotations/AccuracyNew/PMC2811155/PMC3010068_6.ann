T11	Context 229 439	The plasmids carrying shRNA sequences for DRP1, Mito-YFP, mCherry-Parkin, YFP-Parkin (wild type, R275W, C441R), and Mfn2-YFP have been described previously (Karbowski et al., 2007; Narendra et al., 2008, 2010).
T1	ACCURATE 11331 11503	To verify that the âˆ¼63-kDa band is in fact PINK1, we immunoblotted for endogenous PINK1 in M17 cells stably transduced with control short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or PINK shRNA.
