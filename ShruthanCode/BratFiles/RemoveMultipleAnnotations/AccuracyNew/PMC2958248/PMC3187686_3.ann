T4	Context 777 925	TREX1 was proposed to degrade cytosolic DNA resulting from HIV-1 reverse transcription, which would otherwise be capable of inducing an IFN response
T1	ACCURATE 1605 1858	TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway. HIV-stimulated IFN production in cells deficient in TREX1 did not involve known nucleic acid sensors.
