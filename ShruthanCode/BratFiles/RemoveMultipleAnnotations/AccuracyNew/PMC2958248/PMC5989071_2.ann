T3	Context 1760 1864	it has been previously shown that TREX1 degrades ssDNA and dsDNA and DNA in RNA/DNA hybrids (8, 30, 31).
T2	ACCURATE 38735 38836	TREX1 recognizes ssDNA or dsDNA with single strand overhangs â€“ the kind of DNA in failed RT products.
T4	ACCURATE 38837 39008	TREX1 might bind to HIV DNA nonspecifically in the cytosol, but as an exonuclease can only efficiently digest HIV DNA that contains broken ends or single strand overhangs.
