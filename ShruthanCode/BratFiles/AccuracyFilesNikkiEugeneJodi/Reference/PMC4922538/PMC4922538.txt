Acetate mediates a microbiome-brain-β cell axis promoting metabolic syndrome

Abstract

Obesity, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome are associated with changes to the gut microbiota; however, the mechanism by which modifications to the gut microbiota might lead to these conditions is unknown. Here we show that increased production of acetate by an altered gut microbiota leads to activation of the parasympathetic nervous system which in turn promotes increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), increased ghrelin secretion, hyperphagia, obesity and its related sequelae (Extended Data Fig. 1). Taken together, these data identify increased acetate production by a nutrient-gut microbiota interaction and subsequent parasympathetic activation as possible therapeutic targets for obesity.

Gut microbial fatty acid turnover

Prior studies have observed both increases1–5 and decreases6,7 in plasma and fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations associated with overfeeding, obesity and the metabolic syndrome. However, whether and how alterations in SCFA play a causal role in the development of obesity is unknown. Because plasma SCFA concentrations may not fully represent the SCFA load presented to the body, we developed a method to measure whole-body turnover rates of acetate, propionate, and butyrate by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and found that, in contrast to propionate and butyrate, whole-body acetate turnover as well as plasma and fecal acetate concentrations were markedly increased in insulin resistant three day and four week high fat fed (HFD) rats (Fig. 1a–b, Extended Data Fig. 2a–j).

Next we sought to determine the source of the increased acetate turnover in HFD rats. We measured tissue acetate concentrations and dilution of 13C acetate label during an infusion of 13C acetate, and found each to be increased in the luminal contents of the cecum and ascending colon, with HFD rats exhibiting more than a two-fold increase in total acetate in the cecum and colon as well as in 13C bicarbonate incorporation into 13C acetate compared to chow fed rats (Fig. 1c–d, Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2k). In order to conclusively determine the source of the increased acetate production in HFD rats, we conducted four independent in vivo experiments to distinguish colon lumen acetate production from production by the rest of the body: we 1) washed out the contents of the cecum and colon with a saline flush, 2) ligated the portal vein below the splenic juncture, 3) treated rats with poorly absorbed broad-spectrum oral antibiotics and 4) performed an acute colectomy and found that each intervention reduced whole-body acetate turnover by 75–90% (Fig. 2b–f). Taken together these data strongly suggest that the gut microbiota is the source of most of the increased endogenous acetate production in HFD rats. We next showed that fecal material can generate acetate in vitro from 13C glucose or 13C fatty acids, and that boiling or irradiating the feces prevents the production of acetate, suggesting a role for fecal microbes in generating acetate (Extended Data Fig. 2l–n). Consistent with this hypothesis, treatment of the fecal material with broad-spectrum antibiotics vancomycin and/or gentamycin markedly reduced acetate production (Extended Data Fig. 2o).

Acetate drives insulin secretion

Next we examined glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) during a hyperglycemic clamp and measured marked increases in GSIS in 3 day and 4 week HFD rats (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). To determine whether the associated increases in acetate turnover drove this increased GSIS, we performed hyperglycemic clamps in chow fed rats given intra-arterial infusions of acetate to match whole-body acetate turnover to that measured in HFD rats. Acetate infusion in chow fed rats replicated the increases in GSIS measured in HFD rats (Fig. 3b–c, Extended Data Fig. 3d–g), strongly implicating increased acetate turnover in driving acute increases in GSIS in HFD rodents. In contrast, replacing butyrate turnover to levels observed in high fat fed rats had no effect on GSIS (Extended Data Fig. 3h–m).

In order to further evaluate the effects of alterations in food intake on gut acetate production, we fasted 4 week HFD rats for 48 hours and found that this intervention resulted in ~50% reductions in whole-body acetate turnover and in GSIS; however, replacing acetate by arterial infusion of 20 μmol/(kg-min) acetate resulted in restoration of GSIS in 48 hour fasted rats (Extended Data Fig. 4a–f). Next we performed a series of dietary interventions to assess whether simple caloric excess or variations in nutrient composition8–10 were responsible for the increased acetate turnover measured in HFD rats (Extended Data Fig. 4g). Pair feeding isocaloric portions of chow or HFD resulted in no change in acetate turnover or GSIS, whereas dietary interventions resulting in increased caloric intake increased acetate turnover and GSIS proportionally to the total calories consumed (Extended Data Fig. 4h–n, R2=0.90). To examine the role of the gut microbiota in acetate-induced hyperinsulinemia, we treated HFD rats with broad-spectrum, poorly absorbable oral antibiotics and measured a 70% reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during a hyperglycemic clamp, which was acutely reversed by infusion of acetate to match plasma acetate turnover in HFD rats (Fig. 3d–e, Extended Data Fig. 4o–s).

To establish a causal relationship between the microbiota and GSIS, we next transferred fecal material from chow- or HFD-fed donors to chow- or HFD-fed recipients under anaerobic conditions. Consistent with previous reports,4,12–15 culture-independent 16S rRNA sequencing of donor and recipient fecal microbiomes revealed an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and a decrease in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in fresh fecal pellets from high fat fed donors relative to chow fed donors, and fecal transplantation altered the recipient animal microbiome to resemble that of the donor (Extended Data Fig. 5a–f). Notably, these fecal transplantations also transferred the corresponding acetate turnover, fecal acetate, and GSIS from the donor group to the recipient group (Fig. 3f–g, Extended Data Fig. 6a–e). However, transplantation of chow-fed donor microbiota into chow-fed recipients by an identical procedure did not produce microbiota alterations or metabolic phenotypes (Fig. 3f–g, Extended Data Fig. 5a–f, 6a–e).

Having found a strong causal relationship between acetate turnover and GSIS, we next examined the mechanism by which increased acetate turnover caused increased GSIS. We first examined whether acetate may stimulate GSIS through a direct effect on β-cells, perhaps through increasing acetylcarnitine concentrations.11,12 However, we found that neither acetate nor acetylcarnitine stimulated GSIS in isolated islet perifusions, ruling out a direct effect on the β-cell (Fig. 3h, Extended Data Fig. 6f–h). In addition, β-cell stimulatory amino acid concentrations and plasma glucagon concentrations were unchanged or reduced in the acetate-infused rats (Extended Data Fig. 6i–k). A small (~2 pM) but significant increase in plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentrations was measured in rats infused with acetate ( Extended Data Fig. 6l). Because GLP-1 can stimulate GSIS,13,14 we treated acetate-infused rats with a GLP-1 inhibitor and found no difference in GSIS in these animals (Extended Data Fig. 6m–s), demonstrating that these small changes in GLP-1 were not responsible for the increased GSIS in acetate-infused rats.

Acetate drives GSIS via the parasympathetics

As parasympathetic input is a well-known stimulator of β-cell insulin secretion,15 we next measured plasma gastrin concentrations as a marker of parasympathetic activity in rats acutely infused with acetate, and observed a three-fold increase in plasma gastrin after 60 min of infusion with 20 μmol/(kg-min) acetate (Fig. 4a). Increases in brain acetate concentrations in the 20 μmol/(kg-min) acetate infused animals confirmed the ability of acetate infused systemically to enter the brain circulation (Fig. 4b). Because vagal stimulation has been shown to drive and vagotomy has been shown to suppress basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion,16–20 we hypothesized that vagotomy would reduce GSIS in acetate-infused rats. Consistent with this hypothesis, vagotomized rats exhibited ~4-fold lower plasma insulin concentrations throughout a hyperglycemic clamp without any effect on plasma glucagon concentrations (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 7a–h). In addition, treatment with the parasympathetic blocker atropine prior to the acetate infusion abolished acetate’s ability to stimulate GSIS, without any effect on plasma glucagon concentrations (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 7i–n), replicating prior studies demonstrating atropine’s ability to suppress basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion indirectly in vitro and in vivo.19,21–23 In order to further evaluate whether the effect of parasympathetic stimulation of GSIS is centrally mediated, we administered acetate intracerebroventricularly (ICV) at a dose chosen to increase cerebrospinal fluid acetate concentrations by 200 μM, mimicking the increases in plasma acetate concentrations measured with a 20 μmol/(kg-min) intra-arterial acetate infusion. ICV acetate tripled GSIS during a hyperglycemic clamp without any difference in systemic acetate concentrations; however, this effect was blocked by treatment with atropine, and was independent of changes in plasma glucagon concentrations (Fig. 4e–f, Extended Data Fig. 8a–d), suggesting a central effect of acetate to increase GSIS. Because atropine has also been shown to act directly on the β-cell to suppress insulin secretion, we infused rats with intra-arterial acetate and examined the effect of ICV methylatropine, an atropine analog that does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Consistent with an effect of acetate to drive GSIS via the parasympathetic nervous system, methylatropine fully abrogated the effect of acetate to drive GSIS (Fig. 4g–h, Extended Data Fig. 8e–i). To further implicate activation of the parasympathetic nervous system in driving this effect, we injected the same dose of acetate into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), and found that this intervention replicated the effects of systemic and ICV acetate on GSIS by driving parasympathetic outflow as indicated by a ten-fold increase in plasma gastrin concentrations without any change in systemic plasma acetate or glucagon (Fig. 4i–j, Extended Data Fig. 8j–o). Taken together, these data conclusively demonstrate that the effect of acetate to increase GSIS occurs through parasympathetic activation.

Chronic increases in acetate drive obesity

We next examined whether a chronic increase in acetate turnover would promote chronic hyperinsulinemia, hyperphagia, and weight gain and the associated sequelae of obesity. To test this hypothesis, we performed ten-day continuous intragastric acetate infusions, treating chow fed rats with 20 μmol/(kg-min) acetate to mimic the increase in gut microbial acetate production measured in HFD rats (Extended Data Fig. 9a–b). Chronic intragastric acetate-infused rats exhibited increased insulin secretion during both a hyperglycemic clamp and an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, which was associated with a five-fold increase in plasma gastrin concentrations (Fig. 5a–b, Extended Data Fig. 9c–h). All of these effects were prevented in vagotomized rats. Consistent with the hypothesis that chronic postprandial hyperinsulinemia leads to increased weight gain, chronic intragastric acetate-infused rats exhibited more than a doubling in daily caloric intake and in weight gain over the ten-day infusion, which may be attributable, at least in part, to a three-fold increase in plasma ghrelin concentrations (Fig. 5c–d, Extended Data Fig. 9i–j). These effects were also prevented in vagotomized rats, demonstrating that parasympathetic activation is necessary to mediate acetate’s chronic effects on GSIS in awake, unrestrained rodents. Finally, acetate-infused rats exhibited insulin resistance, as indicated by impaired glucose disposal and impaired insulin suppression of hepatic glucose production during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp; and increases in plasma, liver, and skeletal muscle triglyceride content without any differences in plasma glucagon concentrations (Fig. 5e–h, Extended Data Fig. 9k–p). Vagotomized rats exhibited none of these consequences of the acetate infusion.

Taken together, each of these experiments strongly suggests that the gut microbiota are responsible for generating the increased acetate turnover and driving obesity in HFD rats, although we cannot rule out an additional contribution of the microbiota modulating acetate absorption.24 To conclusively test this hypothesis, we measured plasma and colonic acetate content in germ-free (GF) mice lacking gut microbes and ex-GF mice 4 weeks after colonization with normal mouse feces (conventionalized; CONV-D) fed either a regular chow or high fat diet. Demonstrating the role of the gut microbiota as the main producer of acetate in vivo, GF mice had negligible plasma, colonic lumen, and tissue acetate concentrations as compared to CONV-D mice; only conventionalized mice exhibited an increase in acetate concentrations on high fat diet (Fig. 6a–c). GF mice fed 13C bicarbonate also exhibited strikingly lower plasma and tissue 13C enrichment than CONV-D mice, and only in CONV-D mice, 13C acetate was doubled in HFD relative to chow fed animals (Fig. 6d). As rodents do not possess the enzymes necessary to convert bicarbonate to acetate, these results demonstrate that the gut microbiota are responsible for the increased acetate turnover in HFD animals, a conclusion corroborated by the fact that colonic 13C acetate enrichment in CONV-D mice was more than double the enrichment in plasma or in any other tissue (Extended Data Fig. 10a). In contrast propionate and butyrate concentration and enrichment were minimal in plasma and tissues in all mice (Extended Data Fig. 10b–g). Finally, because of the role of increased acetate in promoting parasympathetic activation, we measured plasma gastrin and ghrelin concentrations in the GF and CONV-D mice, and found that ex-GF conventionalized mice exhibited 2- and 10-fold increases in gastrin and ghrelin, respectively, which were associated with 2- and 5-fold increases in liver and skeletal muscle triglyceride content (Fig. 6e–h). Taken together, these data clearly implicate the gut microbiota as responsible for the majority of the whole-body plasma acetate turnover in vivo and for the increase in acetate turnover observed in high fat fed rodents.

Conclusions

In summary, we show here that increased acetate production due to a gut microbiota-nutrient interaction in high fat fed rodents leads to activation of the parasympathetic nervous system resulting in increased ghrelin secretion and GSIS. This generates a positive feedback loop resulting in hyperphagia, hypertriglyceridemia, ectopic lipid deposition in liver and skeletal muscle, and liver and muscle insulin resistance. Evolutionarily, the increased acetate production that occurs when the gut microbiota are exposed to calorically dense nutrients may mediate an important positive feedback loop between the gut microbiota and the CNS that promotes hyperphagia (due to increased ghrelin secretion) and increased energy storage as fat (due to increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion) in foraging animals when they stumble across calorically dense foodstuffs in the wilderness. However, in the setting of chronic exposure to calorically dense, abundant food, this gut microbiota-brain-β cell axis promotes obesity and its related sequelae of hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease and insulin resistance.

Gut bacteria are responsible for the majority of acetate production in vivo, and for the increase in HFD rodents. (a), (b) Plasma and cecal/colon lumen acetate concentrations in germ-free (GF) and ex-GF conventionalized (CONV-D) mice. In all panels, *P<0.05 and ****P<0.0001. (c) Tissue acetate concentrations. (d) Plasma 13C acetate enrichment in mice fed water containing 13C bicarbonate for 3 days. (e), (f) Plasma gastrin and ghrelin concentrations. (g), (h) Liver and skeletal muscle triglyceride content. In all panels, data are the mean ± S.E.M. of n=9 GF mice and 10 CONV-D mice per diet.
