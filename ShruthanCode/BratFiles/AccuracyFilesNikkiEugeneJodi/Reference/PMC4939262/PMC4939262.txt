A combinatorial strategy for treating KRAS mutant lung cancer

Abstract

Therapeutic targeting of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma represents a major goal of clinical oncology. KRAS itself has proven difficult to inhibit, and the effectiveness of agents that target key KRAS effectors has been thwarted by activation of compensatory or parallel pathways that limit their efficacy as single agents. Here we take a systematic approach towards identifying combination targets for trametinib, an FDA-approved MEK inhibitor that acts downstream of KRAS to suppress signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Informed by a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen, we show that trametinib provokes a compensatory response involving the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) that leads to signaling rebound and adaptive drug resistance. As a consequence, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of FGFR1 in combination with trametinib enhances tumor cell death in vitro and in vivo. This compensatory response shows distinct specificities – it is dominated by FGFR1 in KRAS mutant lung and pancreatic cancer cells, but is not activated or involves other mechanisms in KRAS wild-type lung and KRAS-mutant colon cancer cells. Importantly, KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells and patient tumors treated with trametinib show an increase in FRS2 phosphorylation, a biomarker of FGFR activation; this increase is abolished by FGFR1 inhibition and correlates with sensitivity to trametinib and FGFR inhibitor combinations. These results demonstrate that FGFR1 can mediate adaptive resistance to trametinib and validate a combinatorial approach for treating KRAS-mutant lung cancer.

Introduction

KRAS encodes a GTPase that couples growth factor signaling to the MAPK cascade and other effector pathways. Oncogenic KRAS mutations compromise its GTPase activity leading to accumulation of KRAS in the active GTP-bound state, thereby leading to hyperactive signaling that initiates and maintains tumorigenesis1. Owing to the high frequency of KRAS mutations in lung adenocarcinoma and other cancers, strategies to inhibit the KRAS protein or exploit synthetic lethal interactions with a mutant KRAS gene have been widely pursued but have been fraught with technical challenges or produced inconsistent results2–7. Conversely, strategies to target key RAS effectors including MAPK pathway components RAF, MEK, and ERK have been hindered by toxicities associated with their sustained inhibition and/or adaptive resistance mechanisms8–11.

shRNA screen for identifying trametinib sensitizers

Hypothesizing that sustained MAPK inhibition is necessary, but not sufficient, for targeting KRAS-mutant cancers, we performed a pool-based shRNA screen to identify genes whose inhibition sensitizes KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells to the FDA-approved MEK inhibitor trametinib (Supplementary Table 1). A customized shRNA library targeting the human kinome was introduced into the TRMPVIN vector that we previously optimized for negative selection screening12,13. In this system, cassettes encoding a mir-30 shRNA linked to a dsRed fluorescent reporter are placed downstream of a tetracycline responsive promoter, enabling doxycycline dependent gene silencing and the facile tracking and/or sorting of shRNA expressing cells (Extended Data 1a)12. This library was transduced into H23 KRASG12C mutant lung cancer cells expressing a reverse-tet-transactivator (rtTA3). The transduced populations were then treated with doxycycline in the presence or absence of 25 nM trametinib, a dose that effectively inhibits ERK signaling without substantially affecting proliferation (Extended Data Fig.1b, c, d, e). After ten population doublings, changes in shRNA representation were determined by sequencing of shRNAs amplified from dsRed-sorted cells (Extended Data Fig.1b).

As expected, shRNAs targeting essential genes (RPA1 and CDK11A) were strongly depleted in both vehicle and trametinib-treated cells, whereas the relative representation of neutral non-targeting control shRNAs (Renilla (REN)) remained unchanged (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1f, g). Using selection criteria that required an average 4-fold or greater depletion between conditions, we identified 64 shRNAs corresponding to 53 genes that were selectively depleted upon MEK inhibition in trametinib-treated compared to untreated cells (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig.1h). Of these, shRNAs targeting the 8 genes for which multiple shRNAs identified as hits were validated using cell competition assays in multiple KRAS-mutant lung lines. These studies identified BRAF, CRAF, ERK2, and FGFR1 as the top candidates in our screen (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2a).

Trametinib has superior pharmacologic properties compared to other MEK inhibitors because it impairs feedback reactivation of ERK10. Still, the fact that MAPK components were identified as hits in our screen implied that pathway reactivation eventually occurs. Indeed, although trametinib stably inhibits ERK signaling at 48-hours – a time where rebound occurs with other agents10 - we observed an increase in phospho-ERK after 6–12 days of drug exposure (Fig. 1c). This rebound was reduced by subsequently increasing the concentration of trametinib, indicating that it is MEK dependent (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Accordingly, inducible knockdown of ERK2, CRAF, and BRAF blocked ERK signaling rebound and reduced clonogenic growth after trametinib treatment (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2c, d). Similar effects were observed in KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells treated with trametinib and the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 (Fig. 1e, f, and Extended Data Fig. 3)14. These observations underscore the marked dependency of KRAS-mutant tumors on the MAPK signaling pathway.

In agreement with other studies, KRAS-mutant cells treated with trametinib also displayed compensatory activation of the PI3K and JAK/STAT pathways as assessed by AKT and STAT3 phosphorylation, respectively (Fig. 1d, e, g and Extended Data Fig. 2c, 3b, 4a)11,15. Although the increase in STAT3 phosphorylation was transient (Extended Data Fig. 4a), AKT phosphorylation was sustained (Fig. 1g). In contrast to their effects on ERK signaling rebound, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK signaling had little effect on the trametinib-induced increase in pAKT (Fig. 1d, e, and Extended Data Fig. 2c, 3b). The activation of multiple signaling pathways following trametinib-treatment likely reflects a relief in pleiotropic feedback mechanisms produced by hyperactive RAS signaling in KRAS-mutant cells8,9.

FGFR1 mediates adaptive drug resistance

Several RTKs have been implicated in adaptive resistance to RAS pathway antagonist8,9,11,15–20. The identification of FGFR1 shRNAs as trametinib sensitizers raised the possibility that FGFR1 mediates MAPK and PI3K activation in trametinib-treated KRAS-mutant cells. In agreement, treatment of KRAS-mutant lung tumor cell lines with trametinib increased FGFR1 receptor and/or ligand expression together with FGFR pathway activation as assessed by an increase in phosphorylation of the FGFR adaptor protein FRS2 (Fig. 2a, b, and Extended Data Fig. 2b, 4b, c, d, e)21. In turn, FGFR1 activation correlated with an increase in the levels of RAS-GTP, phospho-AKT, and phospho-ERK (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4e), which was prevented by FGFR1 knockdown (Fig. 2c). Accordingly, FGFR1 shRNAs did not inhibit the proliferation of KRAS-mutant lung cancer, but displayed synergistic inhibitory effects when combined with trametinib (Fig. 2d, e, and Extended Data Fig. 4f, g).

The combinatorial effects of FGFR1 inhibition and trametinib showed distinct specificities: for example, shRNAs targeting FGFR1 or FRS2, but not those targeting FGFR2 and 3, sensitized KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells to trametinib (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4h, i). By contrast, FGFR1 knockdown had little impact on trametinib sensitivity in KRAS wild-type lung cancer cells (Fig. 2g). While FGFR1 shRNAs synergized with trametinib in two KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer cell lines, they showed little activity in trametinib-treated KRAS-mutant colorectal lines (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Importantly, this genotype and tissue specificity correlated with the ability of trametinib to trigger FRS2 phosphorylation when applied as a single agent (Extended Data Fig. 5b, c, d). Therefore, treatment of certain KRAS-mutant tumor types with trametinib induces a dependency on FGFR1 signaling that promotes adaptive drug resistance.

FGFR1 inhibition enhances trametinib effects

We next tested whether therapeutic strategies combining trametinib with an FGFR1 inhibitor could be effective in treating some KRAS-mutant lung cancers by combining trametinib with ponatinib, an FDA-approved multikinase inhibitor that inhibits FGFR1 and is being tested clinically for activity against FGFR1-amplified lung cancer (Extended Data Fig. 6a)22,23. Ponatinib had little effect on KRAS-mutant cells but countered the trametinib-induced increase in pFRS2, pERK, and pAKT, and synergized with trametinib in inhibiting cell proliferation (Fig. 3a, b, c, and Extended Data Fig. 6b, c, d, e). As observed in our genetic studies, this combination also showed combined activity in human KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer cells and a Kras-mutant murine lung adenocarcinoma line (Extended Data Fig. 7a, b, c), but to a lesser extent in KRAS wild-type lung cancer cells or KRAS-mutant colon cancer cells (Fig. 3c). Although it remains possible that the synergistic effects of this combination involve ponatinib’s ability to target additional kinases, similar results were observed with two other chemically-distinct FGFR inhibitors (Extended Data Fig. 7d, e, 8a)24,25. Importantly, sensitivity to the combination of trametinib and FGFR inhibition correlated with the degree of pFRS2 induction after trametinib treatment (Extended Data Fig. 8b, c).

While our genetic and pharmacologic studies establish the importance of the MAPK pathway in adaptive resistance to trametinib, we reasoned that the compensatory increase in PI3K/AKT signaling also plays a role and that its inhibition by ponatinib contributes to the effects of this drug combination. Accordingly, PTEN knockdown, which can increase PI3K signaling independently of RTK activation, promoted partial resistance to the drug combination in KRAS-mutant H2030 cells. This effect was not observed in H460 cells, a KRAS-mutant line that also harbors an activating mutation in the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 9a, b, c). Consistent with a role for PI3K signaling in promoting cell survival, co-treatment of H23 cells with trametinib and ponatinib triggered substantial apoptosis in a manner that was not observed following treatment with trametinib alone or in combination with an ERK inhibitor (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 9d). Thus, the combined ability of ponatinib to impact reactivation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways contributes to its combinatorial activity in KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells.

We also tested whether other RTKs known to be reactivated following MAPK inhibition contribute to adaptive resistance to trametinib in KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells8,9,11,16–20,26,27. While trametinib treatment of H23 and H2030 cells increased MET and ERBB2 (but not EGFR) levels (Extended Data Fig. 9e, f, g), inhibitors targeting these kinases did not synergize with trametinib under the conditions tested (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 9h, 10a, b). Consistent with previous reports11, the dual EGFR/ERBB2 inhibitor afatinib also showed combinatorial activity with trametinib in some KRAS-mutant lung cancer lines, though in our hands less robustly than the trametinib and ponatinib combination (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 9h, 10a, b). Accordingly, none of the agents tested prevented the rebound in ERK signaling following trametinib treatment (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 10c, d). Thus, reactivation of FGFR1 signaling is a prominent mechanism of adaptive resistance to trametinib in KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells.

MEK/FGFR1 inhibition induces KRAS-mutant tumor regression

We validated our in vitro results in KRAS-mutant lung cancer xenografts, a KRAS-mutant patient-derived xenograft, and a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of KrasG12D-induced lung adenocarcinoma that accurately resembles the human disease28. A549 and H23 xenografts harboring tet-responsive FGFR1- or control-shRNAs were treated with doxycycline and a daily dose of 3 mg/kg of trametinib when tumors reached ~150 mm3. While knockdown of FGFR1 or treatment with trametinib alone had only minor anti-tumor effects, the combination of FGFR1 knockdown with trametinib potently inhibited tumor growth and typically caused tumor regression (Extended Data Fig. 11a, b). Treatment of the xenografts, PDX and GEMM models with vehicle, trametinib, ponatinib, or the drug combination showed similar results, with only the combination producing marked tumor regressions despite no apparent toxicities (Fig. 4a, b, c and Extended Data Fig. 11c, d, e). Moreover, histological analysis of the residual tumor mass in GEMMs treated with the drug combination showed massive necrosis, an effect not seen with either agent alone (Fig. 4d). Similar results were observed in an organoid based, transplantable model of KrasG12D-driven pancreatic cancer, in which the drug combination produced marked cell death and significantly enhanced survival (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 11f).

We also examined the ability of trametinib to induce FGFR1 signaling in KRAS-mutant tumors. Consistent with in vitro results, a KRAS-mutant lung PDX model showed a concomitant increase in FRS2, ERK, and AKT phosphorylation following trametinib treatment – an effect that was canceled by ponatinib (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 11g). Furthermore, FRS2 phosphorylation was dramatically increased following trametinib treatment in two KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients (Fig. 5b), indicating that the mechanism of adaptive resistance identified in our preclinical models is clinically relevant.

Discussion

In summary, by implementing a stringent approach for negative selection shRNA screening, we identified feedback activation of FGFR1 signaling as a prominent mechanism of adaptive resistance to the MEK inhibitor trametinib in KRAS-mutant lung cancer. The mechanism was specific: only shRNAs targeting FGFR1, but not other FGFR family members or other RTKs tested conferred trametinib sensitivity, and only FGFR1 inhibition blocked compensatory reactivation of both ERK and AKT. In agreement, an unbiased ORF screen identified FGFR1, but not other RTKs, as sufficient to allow proliferation of KRAS-mutant colon cancer cells following KRAS suppression29. In our hands, the synergistic effects of the trametinib/FGFR inhibitor combinations were largely restricted to KRAS-mutant lung and pancreatic cancer cells, but not KRAS wild-type lung or KRAS-mutant colon cancer cells. These results strongly associate sensitivity to the combination with the magnitude of FRS2 phosphorylation following trametinib treatment alone and provide a mechanistic foothold to predict and study cell line and tumor variability.

Our results provide strong mechanistic support for combining trametinib with FGFR1 inhibitors for treating KRAS-mutant lung cancer and pinpoint a biomarker that might eventually be used to identify other patients likely to benefit from this drug combination. Although careful attention to additive or synergistic toxicities will be required for the clinical implementation of these findings, it seems likely that targeting a specific RTK such as FGFR1 will be more tolerable than targeting more pleiotropic factors such as AKT30 and presents a rationale for developing more specific FGFR1 antagonists. Regardless, our study provides further evidence that targeting adaptive resistance mechanisms can improve the efficacy of molecular targeted therapies and provides one path towards developing rational strategies for treating KRAS-mutant lung cancer.

METHODS

Pooled negative-selection RNAi screening

A custom shRNA library targeting 526 human kinases was designed using miR30-adapted DSIR predictions refined with “sensor” rules31 (six shRNAs per gene) and constructed by PCR-cloning a pool of oligonucleotides synthesized on customized arrays (Agilent Technologies and CustomArray) as previously described (Supplementary Table 1)12. The list of genes was obtained from KinBase Database (http://kinase.com/human/kinome/) and was manually curated. After sequence verification, 3156 shRNAs (5–6 per gene) were combined with 20 positive- and negative-control shRNAs at equal concentrations in one pool. This pool was subcloned into the TRMPV-Neo vector and transduced in triplicates into Tet-on H23 KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells using conditions that predominantly lead to a single retroviral integration and represent each shRNA in a calculated number of at least 1,000 cells. Transduced cells were selected for 6 days using 1 mg ml−1 G418 (Invitrogen); at each passage more than 30 million transduced cells were maintained to preserve library representation throughout the experiment. After drug selection, T0 samples were obtained (~30 million cells per replicate (n = 3)) and cells were subsequently cultured in the presence or absence of trametinib (25 nM) and 1 µg ml−1 doxycycline to induce shRNA expression. After ten population doublings (Tf), about fifteen million shRNA-expressing (dsRed+/Venus+) cells were sorted for each replicate using a FACSAriaII (BD Biosciences). Genomic DNA from T0 and Tf samples was isolated by two rounds of phenol extraction using PhaseLock tubes (5prime) followed by isopropanol precipitation. Deep-sequencing template libraries were generated by PCR amplification of shRNA guide strands as previously described12. Libraries were analyzed on an Illumina Genome Analyzer at a final concentration of 8 pM; 50 nucleotides of the guide strand were sequenced using a custom primer (miR30EcoRISeq, TAGCCCCTTGAATTCCGAGGCAGTAGGCA). To provide a sufficient baseline for detecting shRNA depletion in experimental samples, we aimed to acquire >500 reads per shRNA in the T0 sample, which required more than twenty million reads per sample to compensate for disparities in shRNA representation inherent to the pooled plasmid preparation or introduced by PCR biases. With these conditions, we acquired T0 baselines of >500 reads for 3151 (97.9%) shRNAs. Sequence processing was performed using a customized Galaxy platform32.

Using selection criteria that required an shRNA depletion averaging greater than 4-fold after ten population doublings and an effect greater than 4-fold in trametinib-treated cells with respect to untreated ones, 64 shRNAs were identified. The 8 targets for which at least two shRNAs were selectively depleted following trametinib treatment were subject to secondary validation in cell competition assays using multiple KRAS-mutant lung cancer cell lines. 6 targets validated in the cell line in which the primary screen was performed (H23 cells) and 4 (BRAF, CRAF, ERK2, and FGFR1) across a panel of KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells, and as such these represented the top hits of our screen.

Plasmids and recombinant proteins

All vectors were derived from the Murine Stem Cell Virus (MSCV, Clontech) retroviral vector backbone. miR30- and mirE-based shRNAs were designed and cloned as previously described12 and sequences are available in Supplementary Table 1. shRNAs were cloned into the TRMPV-Neo (pSIN-TREdsRed-miR30-PGK-Venus-IRES-NeoR), LT3GEPIR (TRE3G-GFP-miRE-PGK-PuroR-IRES-rtTA3), and MLP (LTR-miR30-PGK-PuroR-IRES-GFP) vectors as previously described12. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Recombinant proteins FGF2 (8910, Cell Signaling), HGF (100-39, Peprotech), EGF (AF-100-15, Peprotech), and NRG1 (100-03, Peprotech) were used at 50 ngml−1 for 10 minutes.

Cell culture, compounds, and competitive proliferation assays

H23, H460, H2030, H358, H2122, H820, H3255, and A549 cells were kindly provided by R. Somwar and H. Varmus (Cornell University, New York). H2009, HCT116, SW480, SW620, DLD-1, PaTu 8988t, 3T3, MIAPACA-2, and PANC-1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). H69, H82, HCC-33, and H446 were kindly provided by C. Rudin (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York). H1975, H1650, Ludlu-1, H1703, PC-14, H2170, SK-MES-1, H520, H522, EBC-1, HCC-15, H441, A-427, and H1299 cells were kindly provided by M. Sanchez-Cespedes (IDIBELL, Barcelona). Cell lines were not authenticated. Murine KRASG12D; p53R270H cells were derived from a murine lung adenocarcinoma. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO , grown in RPMI 1640 or DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 IUml−1 penicillin/streptomycin. All cell lines used were negative for mycoplasma.

Trametinib (S2673), SCH772984 (S7101), Gefitinib (S1025), Crizotinib (S1068), CP-724714 (S1167), Afatinib (S1011), BGJ398 (S2183), AZD4547 (S2801), and Ponatinib (S1490) were obtained from Selleckchem. Drugs for in vitro studies were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to yield 5 or 10 mM stock solutions and stored at −80 °C.

For shRNA experiments, when necessary, human cancer cells were modified to express the ecotropic receptor and rtTA3 by retroviral transduction of MSCV-RIEP (MSCV-rtTA3-IRES-EcoR-PGK-Puro) followed by drug selection (1 µgml−1 puromycin for 1 week). Cell lines were transduced with ecotropically packaged TRMPV-Neo-shRNA retroviruses or, alternatively, with amphotropically packaged LT3GEPIR-Puro-shRNA lentiviruses, selected with 1mgml−1 G418 or 1 µgml−1 puromycin for 1 week, and treated with 1 µgml−1 doxycycline to induce shRNA expression.

For competitive proliferation assays shRNA-transduced cells were mixed with non-transduced cells (8:2) and cultured with doxycycline in the presence or absence of trametinib (25 nM). The relative percentage of Venus+/dsRed+ or GFP+ cells was determined before (T0 – blue bars) and after ten population doublings (Tf) (results are relative to T0) (Tf on dox – grey bars / Tf on dox + trametinib – red bars). The quantification of fluorescent cells was monitored on a Guava Easycyte (Millipore). Experiments were performed independently two or three times.

Lentiviral production

Lentiviruses were produced by co-transfection of 293T cells with lentiviral-Cre backbone construct and packaging and envelope vectors (psPAX2 and VSV-G), using the calcium phosphate method. Supernatant was collected 48, 60 and 72 h post-transfection, concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 24,000 r.p.m. for 120 min and resuspended in an appropriate volume of HBSS solution (Gibco).

Clonogenic and apoptosis assay

For clonogenic assays, cells were seeded in triplicate into 6-well plates (5–10 × 103 cells per well) and allowed to adhere overnight in regular growth media. Cells were then cultured in the absence or presence of drug as indicated in complete media for 10–14 days. Growth media with or without drug was replaced every 2 days. Remaining cells were fixed with methanol (1%) and formaldehyde (1%), stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and photographed using a digital scanner. Relative growth was quantified by densitometry after extracting crystal violet from the stained cells using 10% of acetic acid. All experiments were performed at least three times. Representative experiments are shown.

For apoptosis assays, around 1 × 106 cells were seeded into 10-cm plates and cultured in the presence or absence of drugs as indicated. After 6 days, apoptosis and cell death were determined using AnnexinV-APC apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Affymetrix eBioscience). Data were acquired using a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences). All experiments were performed independently three times.

Quantitative analysis of drug synergy and determination of fold change in sensitivity to trametinib

Drug synergism was analyzed using CompuSyn software (Version 1.0) (http://www.combosyn.com), which is based on the Median-Effect Principle (Chou) and the Combination Index-Isobologram Theorem (Chou-Talalay)33. CompuSyn software generates combination index (CI) values, where CI <1 indicates synergism; CI = 0.75–1.25 indicates additive effects; and CI >1 indicates antagonism. Following the instruction of the software, drug combinations at non-constant ratios were used to calculate Combination Index (CI) in our study.

For calculating the fold change in sensitivity to trametinib, the GI  for trametinib was determined for a panel of KRAS wild type and mutant cancer cell lines in the absence or presence of ponatinib and AZD4547. Experiments were performed independently two times.

Immunoblotting and RAS-GTP assay

Phospho-lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1% Tween-20, 200 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (5 mM Sodium Fluoride, 1 mM Sodium Orthovanadate, 1 mM Sodium Pyrophosphate, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate), and protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets, Roche) was used for cell lysis and protein concentration was determined by Bradford protein Assay kit (Biorad). Proteins were separated by SDS-Page and immunoblotted and transferred to polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore) according to standard protocols. Membranes were immunoblotted with antibodies against pERKT202/Y204 (9101), tERK (9107), pAKTS473 (4060), tAKT (9272), pFRS2Y436 (3861), pSTAT3Y705 (9145), pMEKS217/221 (9154), MEK (4694), pMETY1234/1235 (3077), MET (8198), pERBB2Y1221/1222 (2243), pEGFRY1068 (3777), EGFR (4267), pERBB3Y1289 (4791), and PTEN (9559) from Cell Signaling; CRAF (SC-227), and BRAF (SC-5284) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and KRAS (WH0003845M1) from Sigma in 5% BSA in TBS blocking buffer. After primary antibody incubation, membranes were probed with ECL anti-rabbit IgG, anti-mouse IgG or anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (1:10,000) from GE Healthcare Life Science and imaged using the FluorChem M system (protein simple). GTP-bound RAS was measured using the CRAF RAS-binding-domain (RBD) pull down and detection kit (8821, Cell Signaling) as instructed by the manufacturer. All immunoblots were performed independently at least twice.

qRT-PCR

Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL (Invitrogen), and cDNA was obtained using the TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was carried out in triplicate in three independent experiments using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on the ViiA™ 7 Real-Time PCR System (Invitrogen). GAPDH or β-actin served as endogenous normalization controls.

Animal studies

All mouse experiments were approved by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol no. 12-04-006). Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, and food and water were provided ad libitum. 5–7-week-old, female athymic NCR-NU-NU (Harlan laboratories) mice were used for animal experiments with human cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. For A549, H23, and H2122 xenografts, cells (10 × 106) were harvested on the day of use and injected in growth-factor-reduced Matrigel/PBS (50% final concentration). One flank was injected subcutaneously per mouse. For JHU-LX55a patient-derived xenograft, a poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma bearing a KRASG12C mutation, tumors were cut into pieces and inserted into a pocket in the subcutaneous space as previously described34. After inoculation, mice were monitored daily, weighed twice weekly, and caliper measurements begun when tumors became visible. Tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: tumor volume=(D × d2)/2, in which D and d refer to the long and short tumor diameter, respectively. When tumors reached a size of 150–300 mm3, mice were randomized into 5–8 per group and treated with vehicle, trametinib and/or ponatinib per os for 4 consecutive days followed by 3 days off treatment, at 3 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, respectively. No obvious toxicities were observed in the vehicle- or drug-treated animals as assessed by difference in body weight between vehicle- and drug-treated mice taking tumor size into account. For immunohistochemistry analysis of JHU-LX55a patient-derived xenograft tumors, tumors were harvested 4 hours after dosing on day 18.

For drug efficacy studies using a genetically engineered mouse model of lung cancer, KrasLSL-G12D/+ and Trp53fl/fl mice (8–12 weeks old) were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80 mg per kg) and xylazine (10 mg per kg) and infected intratracheally with 2.5 × 105 infectious particles of Lenti-Cre per mouse, as previously described35. Mice were evaluated by µCT imagingto quantify lung tumor burden before being assigned to various treatment study cohorts. Mice were treated with vehicle, trametinib and/or ponatinib per os for 4 consecutive days followed by 3 days off treatment, at 3 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, respectively. µCT imaging evaluation was repeated every week during the treatment. Investigators were not blind with respect to treatment.

For drug efficacy studies using an organoid-derived murine model of pancreatic cancer, spherical, duct like organoids were derived and cultured in matrigel and defined media as previously described36 from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) occurring in KrasLSL-G12D/+; Trp53fl/+; CHC (Untargeted collagen homing cassette); RIK (Rosa26-LSL-rtTa3-IRES-Kate2); p48Cre mice (GEMM-KPCflox/+) generated via the PDAC-GEMM-ESC approach37. After initially establishing primary organoid cultures, Kate positive cells were sorted and expanded to minimize injection of non-recombined, normal duct cells. For the orthotopic transplantation of PDAC organoids, mice were anesthetized using Isoflurane, and the pancreas was externalized through a small incision made in the left abdominal side near the spleen. Organoids (approximately 250000–500000 cells per mouse) were removed from matrigel and separated into single cells by trypsinization, washed, and finally resuspended in 25 µl of Matrigel (Matrigel, BD) diluted 1:1 with cold PBS. The organoid suspension was injected into the tail region of the pancreas using 28 gauge surgical syringes (Hamilton). Successful injection was verified by the appearance of a fluid bubble without signs of intraperitoneal leakage. The abdominal wall was sutured with absorbable Vicryl suture (Ethicon), and the skin was closed with wound clips (CellPoint Scientific Inc.). Mice were evaluated by ultrasound(Vevo 2100, VisualSonics)to quantify pancreas tumor burden before being randomized to various treatment study cohorts. All the treatment mice had similar initial tumor burden. Mice were treated as described above for drug efficacy studies using a genetically engineered model of lung cancer. Investigators were not blind with respect to treatment.

µCT imaging

µCT Scans were performed on the Mediso Nano SPECT/CT System covering only the lung fields of each mouse. Each scan averaged approximately 6 min using 240 projections with an exposure time of 1,000 ms set at a pitch of 1 degree. The tube energy of the X-ray was 55 kVp and 145 µA. The in-plane voxel sizes chosen were small and thin creating a voxel size of 73 × 73 × 73 µm. The final reconstructed image consisted of 368 × 368 × 1,897 voxels. Scans were analysed with the Osirix software.

Patient samples

Patients with KRAS mutation-positive advanced lung adenocarcinomas were enrolled in the phase I/II clinical study of trametinib and navitoclax (NCT02079740) and the response was assessed per RECIST (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors) criteria. Biopsies were obtained before treatment, and within 2–4 weeks after starting the treatment with trametinib. Specifically, for patient #1, the post-treatment biopsy was obtained after treatment with navitoclax for 7 days, followed by co-treatment with navitoclax and trametinib for 16 days. The post-treatment biopsy from patient #2 was obtained after co-treatment with navitoclax and trametinib for 22 days. All human studies were approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board, and informed consent to study was obtained as per protocol from all patients.

Immunohistochemistry

Tissues were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5 µm thick sections. Sections were subject to hematoxylin and eosin staining, and immunohistochemical staining following standard protocols. The following primary antibodies were used: pERKT202/Y204 (4370) and pAKTS473 (4060) (Cell signaling), and pFRS2Y436 (ab193363) (Abcam).

Statistical Analysis

Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m or mean ± s.d. Group size was determined based on the results of preliminary experiments and no statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. The indicated sample size (n) represents biological replicates. Group allocation and outcome assessment were not performed in a blinded manner. All samples that met proper experimental conditions were included in the analysis. Survival was measured using the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical significance was determined using Student’s t-test, log-rank test, and pearson’s correlation using Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software). Significance was set at P<0.05.
