Sparse whole genome sequencing identifies two loci for major depressive disorder

Abstract

Major depressive disorder (MDD), one of the most frequently encountered forms of mental illness and a leading cause of disability worldwide1, poses a major challenge to genetic analysis. To date no robustly replicated genetic loci have been identified 2, despite analysis of more than 9,000 cases3. Using low coverage genome sequence of 5,303 Chinese women with recurrent MDD selected to reduce phenotypic heterogeneity, and 5,337 controls screened to exclude MDD, we identified and replicated two genome-wide significant loci contributing to risk of MDD on chromosome 10: one near the SIRT1 gene (P-value = 2.53×10−10) the other in an intron of the LHPP gene (P = 6.45×10−12). Analysis of 4,509 cases with a severe subtype of MDD, melancholia, yielded an increased genetic signal at the SIRT1 locus. We attribute our success to the recruitment of relatively homogeneous cases with severe illness.

The existence and number of subtypes of depression have been debated over the past 100 years. The current consensus is that depression may be a collection of partly distinct diseases, with overlapping causal pathways. This etiologic heterogeneity might therefore substantially reduce the power of genetic association studies and hence explain the failure to find genetic risk loci 3. For example, there may be cases of MDD of largely environmental origin whose presence reduces power to detect genetic effects. Genetic risk factors for mild depressive syndromes may not be entirely the same as those for more severe cases 4.

For these reasons, we investigated the genetic basis of MDD in subjects for whom known sources of phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity were minimized and known risk factors documented. The CONVERGE ( hina,  xford a d  irginia Commonwealth University  xperimental  esearch on  enetic  pidemiology) consortium recruited 11,670 Han Chinese women through a collaboration involving 58 hospitals in China. We studied women only because about 45% of the genetic liability to MDD is not shared between sexes 5,6. In an attempt to obtain severe cases of MDD, we recruited only recurrent cases (mean number of episodes was 5.6).

We used low coverage sequencing to genotype our sample7. Whole genome sequence was acquired to a mean depth of 1.7× (95% CIs 0.7-4.3) per individual from which 32,781,340 SNP sites were identified. After applying stringent quality controls (Supplemental Methods), we obtained 10,640 samples (5,303 cases of MDD, 5,337 controls) and 6,242,619 SNPs for inclusion in GWAS. We compared genotypes from the low coverage sequencing to genotypes called with 10× coverage sequence and to genotypes called from genotyping arrays and a mass spectrometer platform. The mean percentage concordance between genotypes from nine individuals with both low and 10X coverage across all sites was 98.1% (Supplemental Table 1). We compared imputed genotypes to those acquired for 72 individuals using an array and to 21 SNPs genotyped on all individuals with the MassARRAY™ system mass spectrometer (Supplemental Methods). Overall concordance was 98.0% (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3).

Genetic association analysis was carried out with a linear mixed model with a genetic relatedness matrix (GRM) as a random effect and principal components from eigen-decomposition of the GRM as fixed effects (Methods, Supplemental Methods)8,9. Figure 1a and Extended Data Figure 1 show the Manhattan and quantile-quantile plots respectively for the analysis. The genomic-control inflation factor (λ, the ratio of the observed median χ2 to that expected by chance) for association with MDD was 1.070 (for common SNPs > 2 %, λ = 1.074). The adjusted measure for sample size to that of 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls (λ ) was 1.013.

Two loci exceeded genome-wide significance in association with MDD: one 5′ to the sirtuin1 (SIRT1) gene on chromosome 10 (SNP = rs12415800, chromosome 10:69624180, minor allele frequency (MAF) = 45.2%, P = 1.92×10−8, Figure 1b) and the other in an intron of the phosphorlysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase (LHPP) gene (SNP = rs35936514, chromosome 10:126244970, MAF = 26.0%, P = 1.27×10−8, Figure 1c). All SNPs with P-values of association <10−6 with MDD are listed in Supplemental Table 4.

We checked the accuracy of the imputed genotypes at 12 SNPs with P < 1×10−5, by re-genotyping the CONVERGE samples using a MassARRAY™ system mass spectrometer, thereby confirming their association with MDD. Extended Data Table 1 shows that the correlation between the two assays was high (mean R2 = 0.984), and the odds ratios for the two genome-wide significant SNPs assessed by the two methods were almost identical with highly overlapping confidence intervals (rs12415800 odds ratios: 1.167 vs 1.167; rs35936514 odds ratios: 0.845 vs 0.842).

We replicated the associations by genotyping the same 12 SNPs in a separate Han Chinese cohort of 3,231 cases with recurrent MDD, and 3,186 controls (both sexes). Two SNPs at the peaks of association for SIRT1 and LHPP loci (rs12415800 and rs35936514 respectively) for MDD in CONVERGE were significantly associated with MDD (Table 1). Analysis of the combined samples gave P-values for association with MDD at these two SNPs of 2.53×10−10 and 6.45×10−12, respectively. Extended Data Table 2 shows the genotype distribution and p-values for tests of violation of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) in both CONVERGE and the replication cohort at both SNPs.

Comparison with results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) mega-analysis of European studies3 failed to provide robust replication for our top SNPs (Extended Data Figure 2 and Extended Data Table 3). However the proportion of associations in the same direction in the two studies exceeded chance expectations (P<0.001), and polygenic risk scores from the PGC mega-analysis applied to the CONVERGE samples were of significant (P<0.01) but limited predictive value, accounting for 0.1% of MDD risk in CONVERGE (Extended Data Table 4). It is unclear to what extent differences in sample ascertainment, ethnicity, or other factors contribute to the failure to replicate genetic effects in the PGC sample. Notably, variants at our most strongly associated loci are much rarer in European populations, where rs12415800 (SIRT1) and rs35936514 (LHPP) have frequencies of 3% and 8% respectively, compared to 45% and 26% in CONVERGE.

We considered whether successful mapping of MDD in CONVERGE was attributable to the recruitment of a severe, more genetically determined form of the disease. We tested that hypothesis by looking within CONVERGE at a particularly severe, and more heritable form of MD: melancholia10. Prior research has suggested that MDD patients with melancholia have more impairing, recurrent episodes and that risk for MD is increased in the co-twins of probands with the melancholic subtype11. This increase is greater in monozygotic than dizygotic pairs 11, as would be expected if the subtype were associated with greater genetic risk.

In CONVERGE, 85% of cases met DSM-IV melancholia criteria12. We searched for genetic association in 9,846 samples (4,509 cases and 5,337 controls) and identified the same two loci that exceeded genome-wide significance on chromosome 10. The genomic-control inflation factor λ for melancholia was 1.069, and λ  was 1.014. Even though the sample for melancholia was smaller than for MDD, at the SIRT1 locus the significance of association was two orders of magnitude greater than for (top SNP = rs80309727, chromosome 10:69617347, MAF = 45.2%, P = 2.95×10−10). Extended Data Figure 3 shows the Manhattan plot, quantile-quantile plot and detailed views of the SIRT1 locus associated with melancholia. All SNPs with P-values of association <10−6 with melancholia are listed in Supplemental Table 5. To determine whether the increased association might have arisen by chance, we generated an empirical distribution of odds ratios by randomly selecting 4,509 cases from the total set and re-analysing the association with each of the genome-wide significant variants. We found that the observed value lay on the 98.8 percentile at the SIRT1 locus, but at the 61.6 percentile at the LHPP locus (Extended Data Figure 4).

Our results indicate that, as others have suggested13, obtaining low sequence coverage of a large number of individuals can be an effective way to screen the genome for association signals. We were able to genotype more variants than present on typical genotyping arrays and our set is larger than publicly available sources for imputation14. The imputation pipeline we used employed standard tools, and it is likely that imputation accuracy could be improved with further algorithmic research.

MDD is most likely highly polygenic3 and many additional loci remain to be discovered. We attribute the discovery and replication of two SNPs associated with MDD in CONVERGE to the recruitment of severely ill cases in a population where the disease has a relatively low prevalence (e.g., life-time prevalence rate for MDD in China of 3.6% 15 versus 16.2% in the US 16), at least in part because individuals who report depressive illness in East Asian cultures are more impaired than those in Western cultures17. Consistent with this interpretation, 85% of CONVERGE has melancholia, a severe subtype of MDD; moreover, mapping melancholia led to significant increase in genetic signal at one locus. However, in the absence of replication, this result should be regarded as tentative. Finally we note that one of the replicated risk loci lies close to a gene involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (SIRT1)18, which, together with our finding that MDD is associated with increased amounts of mitochondrial DNA19, suggests an unexpected origin for at least some of the phenotypic manifestations of MDD.

Methods

Sample collection

CONVERGE collected cases of recurrent major depression from 58 provincial mental health centres and psychiatric departments of general medical hospitals in 45 cities and 23 provinces of China. Controls were recruited from patients undergoing minor surgical procedures at general hospitals (37%) or from local community centres (63%). A sample size of 6,000 cases and 6,000 controls was chosen on the basis of evidence available when the study was designed (in 2007) of the likely existence of genetic loci with odds ratio of 1.2 and above. All subjects were Han Chinese women with four Han Chinese grandparents. Cases were excluded if they had a pre-existing history of bipolar disorder, psychosis or mental retardation. Cases were aged between 30 and 60 and had two or more episodes of MDD meeting DSM-IV criteria20 with the first episode occurring between 14 and 50 years of age, and had not abused drugs or alcohol before their first depressive episode. All subjects were interviewed using a computerized assessment system. Interviewers were postgraduate medical students, junior psychiatrists or senior nurses, trained by the CONVERGE team for a minimum of one week. The diagnosis of MDD was established with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) (WHO lifetime version 2.1; Chinese version), which utilized DSM-IV criteria. The interview was originally translated into Mandarin by a team of psychiatrists in Shanghai Mental Health Centre, with the translation reviewed and modified by members of the CONVERGE team.

The replication sample was obtained from five hospitals in the north of China. Patients were diagnosed as having MDD by at least two consultant psychiatrists by DSM-IV criteria. Samples were of both sexes, and all four grandparents were Han Chinese. Cases were aged between 30 and 60, and had two or more episodes of MDD meeting DSM-IV criteria. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, severe medical conditions, abnormal laboratory baseline values, unstable psychiatric features (e.g., suicidal), a history of alcoholism or drug abuse, epilepsy, brain trauma with loss of consciousness, neurological illness, or a concomitant Axis I psychiatric disorder. Control subjects were recruited from local communities and provided information about medical and family histories. Exclusion criteria were a history of major psychiatric or neurological disorders, psychiatric treatment or drug abuse, or family history of severe forms of psychiatric disorders.

The study protocol was approved centrally by the Ethical Review Board of Oxford University (Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee) and the ethics committees of all participating hospitals in China. All interviewers were mental health professionals who are well able to judge decisional capacity. The study posed minimal risk (an interview and saliva sample). All participants provided their written informed consent.

DNA sequencing

DNA was extracted from saliva samples using the Oragene protocol. A barcoded library was constructed for each sample. Sequencing reads obtained from Illumina Hiseq machines were aligned to Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37 patch release 5 (GRCh37.p5) with Stampy (v1.0.17) 21 using default parameters after filtering out reads containing adaptor sequencing or consisting of more than 50% poor quality (base quality <= 5) bases. Samtools (v0.1.18)22 was used to index the alignments in BAM format22 and Picardtools (v1.62) was used to mark PCR duplicates for downstream filtering. The Genome Analysis Toolkit’s (GATK, version 2.6) 23 BaseRecalibrator was then run on the BAM files to create base quality score recalibration tables, masking known SNPs and INDELs from dbSNP (version 137, excluding all sites added after version 129). Base quality recalibration (BQSR) was then performed on the BAM files using GATKlite (v2.2.15)23 while also removing read pairs that did not have the “properly aligned segment” bit set by Stampy (1-5% of reads per sample).

Calling and imputation of genotypes at SNPs included in GWAS

Variant discovery and genotyping at all polymorphic SNPs in 1000G Phase1 East Asian (ASN) reference panel 14 was performed simultaneously using post-BQSR sequencing reads from all samples using the GATK’s UnifiedGenotyper (version 2.7-2-g6bda569). Variant quality score recalibration was then performed on these sites using the GATK’s VariantRecalibrator (version 2.7-2-g6bda569) and the biallelic SNPs from 1000G Phase1 ASN samples as a true positive set of variants. A sensitivity threshold of 90% to SNPs in the 1000G Phase1 ASN panel was applied for SNP selection for imputation after optimizing for Transition to Transversion (TiTv) ratios in SNPs called. Genotype likelihoods (GLs) were calculated at selected sites using a sample-specific binomial mixture model implemented in SNPtools (version 1.0) 24, and imputation was performed at those sites without a reference panel using BEAGLE (version 3.3.2) 25. A second round of imputation was performed with BEAGLE on the same GLs, but only at biallelic SNPs polymorphic in the 1000G Phase 1 ASN panel using the 1000G Phase 1 ASN haplotypes as a reference panel (see Supplemental Methods). A final set of allele dosages and genotype probabilities was generated from these two datasets by replacing the results in the former with those in the latter at all sites imputed in the latter. We then applied a conservative set of inclusion threshold for SNPs for genome-wide association study (GWAS): a) p-value for violation HWE > 10−6, b) Information score > 0.9, c) MAF in CONVERGE > 0.5% to arrive at the final set of 6,242,619 SNPs for GWAS.

Sample selection for GWAS

Using both processed sequencing data and imputed dosages at SNPs that passed quality control, we assessed the sequencing and imputation quality of all 11,670 samples whose genomic variants we imputed. We first assessed the number of private variants called from processed sequencing data of all samples, and excluded 117 samples with excess number of private variants in the genic regions of their nuclear genome. Also using processed sequencing data, we excluded a further 90 samples with excess number of heteroplasmic sites in their mitochondrial genome. Both filters were applied to exclude DNA samples that were likely contaminated. Using imputed data at all sites in the rest of the 11,463 samples, we excluded 29 samples for low imputation quality (maximum genotype probability < 0.9) in more than 10% of imputed sites. Using a subset of 399,211 tagging SNPs (MAF >1%, LD R2 < 0.5, all known in 1000G Phase 1 ASN Panel) across all autosomes, we assessed the pairwise identity by state (IBS) between all remaining samples, and excluded 392 samples for being likely first-degree relatives. Finally, we excluded 590 samples who had incomplete phenotype information from the phenotyping interviews to arrive at the final 10,640 samples for GWAS. These analyses and filters are detailed in Supplemental Methods.

GWAS using linear mixed model and liability score estimates

We performed GWAS one chromosome at a time, with a mixed-linear model including a genetic relationship matrix (GRM) constructed from SNPs in the tagging set other than those on the chromosome being studied. This method is implemented in Factored Spectrally Transformed Linear Mixed Models (FastLMM version 2.06.20130802). Manhattan plots and quantile-quantile plots of the log10 of P-values of the GWAS were generated with custom code in R26. Genomic-control inflation factor lambda was calculated using custom code in R26.

Replication and joint analyses

We genotyped the replication sample on a MassARRAY™ system mass spectrometer. TYPER4.0 was used to assess the reliability of genotype calls generated by SpectroREAD from the mass spectra. Default genotype call inclusion criteria were used. To perform the association analysis with MDD case-control status at these 12 sites in the replication sample, we obtained effect sizes for discovery from logistic regression with PC correction, and then for replication from logistic regression, and then performed fixed-effects meta-analysis.

Polygenic risk profiling and binomial sign-test

Single SNP association results were obtained from the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC) study of MDD3. Prior to analysis, SNPs were lifted-over to GRCh37/hg19 coordinates and excluded if (a) monomorphic in either European (N = 379) or East Asian (N = 286) populations from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 reference data 14 or (b) absent from the filtered CONVERGE dataset. To construct the PGC-trained polygenic score, we initially selected autosomal SNPs with statistical imputation information (INFO) greater than 0.9 and MAF greater than 1% in both studies, and performed subsequent LD-based “clumping” to remove markers from highly-correlated SNP pairs (pairwise R2 > 0.2 in East Asians, 500kb window) while preferentially retaining SNPs with smaller PGC P-values. Using the resultant SNP set, we constructed polygene scores based on varying P-value thresholds (10−6, 10−5, 10−4, 10−3, 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1) as previously described 28 We assessed the predictive value of polygenic scores in a genetically unrelated subset of CONVERGE (with pairwise relatedness less than 0.1) by logistic regression, adjusting for ancestry principal components (2) demonstrating significant association with MDD status. The estimated variance in MDD risk accounted for the polygenic score is given by Nagelkerke’s R2. Using the same P-value thresholds, we tabulated the number of independent SNPs with the same direction of allelic effect in the PGC results as observed in CONVERGE. Filtering criteria for SNPs was INFO score greater than 0.9 in CONVERGE and MAF greater than 1% in both studies, and an analogous LD-clumping procedure was performed (pairwise R2 > 0.2 in Europeans, 500kb window). A one-sided binomial sign test was used to assess whether this observed fraction was significantly greater than expected by chance.
