Structural Variation in Amyloid-β Fibrils from Alzheimer’s Disease Clinical Subtypes

Abstract

Aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides into fibrils or other self-assembled states is central to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Fibrils formed in vitro by 40- and 42-residue Aβ peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) are polymorphic, with variations in molecular structure that depend on fibril growth conditions.1–12 Recent experiments1,13–16 suggest that variations in Aβ fibril structure in vivo may correlate with variations in AD phenotype, in analogy to distinct prion strains that are associated with distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes.17–19 Here we have investigated correlations between structural variation and AD phenotype using solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) measurements on Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils prepared by seeded growth from extracts of AD brain cortex. We compared two atypical AD clinical subtypes, rapidly progressive AD (r-AD) and the posterior cortical atrophy variant (PCA-AD), with typical prolonged duration AD (t-AD). Based on ssNMR data from 37 cortical tissue samples from 18 individuals, we find that a single Aβ40 fibril structure is most abundant in samples from t-AD and PCA-AD patients, while Aβ40 fibrils from r-AD samples exhibit a significantly greater proportion of additional structures. Data for Aβ42 fibrils indicate structural heterogeneity in most samples from all patient categories, with at least two prevalent structures. These results demonstrate the existence of a specific predominant Aβ40 fibril structure in t-AD and PCA-AD, suggest that r-AD may relate to additional fibril structures, and suggest a qualitative difference between Aβ40 and Aβ42 aggregates in AD brain tissue.

Evidence that Aβ fibril polymorphism may correlate with variations in clinical and pathological features of AD includes: (i) Aβ40 fibrils with different molecular structures exhibit different levels of toxicity in primary neuronal cell cultures1; (ii) Patterns of amyloid deposition in transgenic mice, induced by exogenous amyloid-containing biological material, vary with the source of this material13,14; (iii) The size and composition of amyloid plaques induced in transgenic mice by synthetic Aβ42 fibrils depend on the morphology and growth conditions of these fibrils15; (iv) Size distributions and resistance to chemical denaturation of Aβ42 aggregates in brain tissue differ in rapidly progressing and slowly progressing AD patients.16 Improved characterization of the structures of neurotoxic Aβ assemblies in AD and of correlations between structure and disease phenotype would have a major impact on our understanding of pathogenesis, on the development of appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers, and on drug development.

Data from ssNMR are particularly sensitive to structural variations, allowing two-dimensional (2D) 13C-13C and 15N-13C ssNMR spectra to be used as “fingerprints” of specific fibril polymorphs.1,4,20,21 Since ssNMR requires milligram-scale quantities of isotopically labeled fibrils, we amplified and labeled structures in brain tissue by seeded growth, using brain tissue as the source of fibril seeds, as described by Lu et al.4

By analogy with prion diseases, in which different strains produce different durations of illness, preferentially target different brain regions, and are associated with conformational differences in disease-related prion proteins17–19,22, we selected tissue samples from patients from two unusual AD subtypes, namely PCA-AD, which is associated with disruption of visual processing23, and r-AD, in which neurodegeneration occurs within months and which clinically resembles Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.24 We also included tissue from three individuals who died without dementia (ND) but who were found to have Aβ deposition at autopsy.

We separately prepared Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils by seeded growth from amyloid-enriched cortical extracts. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were acquired for all fibril samples. ssNMR measurements were attempted for all samples, although in some cases the signal-to-noise ratios were insufficient for acquisition or subsequent analysis of 2D spectra. Table 1 summarizes the tissue samples, patient categories, and ssNMR measurements. Examples of TEM images and full sets of 2D spectra are given in Extended Data Figs. 1–3. Control experiments with cortical extract from a non-AD patient who did not have significant Aβ deposition are described in the Supplementary Discussion and Extended Data Fig. 4.

Fig. 1 shows representative data for Aβ40 fibrils. In TEM images (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1), certain fibrils exhibit modulations of their apparent width with a period of 107 ± 20 nm (mean and standard deviation based on 65 measurements). This fibril morphology may be more abundant in images of Aβ40 fibrils derived from t-AD and PCA-AD tissue samples. However, quantification of the relative populations of fibril polymorphs from the TEM images is not possible because only a small subset of the fibrils can be visualized clearly. In contrast, all fibrils contribute to the 2D ssNMR spectra. Most 2D spectra of brain-seeded Aβ40 fibrils contain the same set of strong crosspeak signals, indicated by assignments to the isotopically labeled residues in Figs. 1b and 1c, while spectra of certain samples contain additional crosspeak signals with varying intensities.

Fig. 2 shows representative data for Aβ42 fibrils. TEM images do not show a single morphology that is clearly predominant within any of the tissue categories (Fig. 2a). 2D spectra of most samples do not show a single set of crosspeak signals from the isotopically labeled residues (Figs 2b and 2c).

We analyzed the 2D ssNMR spectra with two independent methods, both intended to be objective and devoid of assumptions regarding the nature of the fibril structures or structural variations. Only 2D spectra with adequate signal-to-noise ratios (see Supplementary Methods) were included in these analyses. In the first method, we compared each 2D spectrum in a given set (13C-13C or 15N-13C, Aβ40 or Aβ42) with all other 2D spectra in the same set. Comparisons were quantified by pairwise root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) values between 2D spectra, calculated as described in the Supplementary Methods. For 2D 13C-13C and 15N-13C spectra of Aβ40 fibrils, plots in Fig. 3 indicate that RMSDs among spectra from t-AD and PCA-AD samples are relatively small (blue shades) in most cases, while RMSDs between spectra from r-AD samples and spectra from either t-AD or PCA-AD samples are relatively large (red shades). Thus, t-AD and PCA-AD spectra are similar to one other, but contrast sharply with r-AD spectra, which have larger variability.

Statistics are summarized in Extended Data Table 1a. Mean RMSDs among t-AD spectra are not significantly different from mean RMSDs between t-AD spectra and PCA-AD spectra. However, mean RMSDs among t-AD spectra or among PCA-AD spectra are significantly smaller than mean RMSDs between t-AD spectra and r-AD spectra or between PCA-AD spectra and r-AD spectra (p < 0.001, Welch’s t-test). In addition, for 2D 15N-13C spectra of Aβ40 fibrils, the mean RMSD value among PCA-AD spectra is significantly smaller than the mean RMSD value among t-AD spectra, the mean RMSD value among PCA-AD spectra is significantly smaller than the mean RMSD value among r-AD spectra, and the mean RMSD value among tAD spectra is significantly smaller than the mean RMSD value among r-AD spectra (p < 0.001).

For 2D spectra of Aβ42 fibrils, plots in Fig. 3 do not show clear patterns, and no statistically significant differences among mean RMSDs are identified.

In the second method of analysis, we used singular value decomposition to determine principal component spectra25 for each set of 2D spectra (see Supplementary Methods). For each set, the number N of principal component spectra equals the number of experimental 2D spectra. The experimental spectra within each set, including both crosspeak signals and random noise, can be represented exactly as linear combinations of the principal component spectra (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6), with coefficients C  (k = 1, 2,…, N). As shown in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Table 1b, mean values of C  for 13C-13C and 15N-13C spectra of Aβ40 fibrils derived from r-AD tissue are significantly larger than the corresponding mean values of C  for both t-AD spectra and PCA-AD spectra (p < 0.01). This indicates that 2D spectra of Aβ40 fibrils derived from r-AD tissue differ more strongly from the average 2D spectra than do spectra of Aβ40 fibrils derived from t-AD and PCA-AD tissue. For Aβ42 fibrils, differences in mean values of C  are not significant.

An alternative analysis of the 2D 15N-13C spectra, in which the spectra were fit with a fixed number of crosspeaks at fixed chemical shift positions, is described in the Supplementary Methods and Extended Data Fig. 7. According to this analysis, on average, the predominant Aβ40 fibril structure typically accounts for approximately 80% of the crosspeak signal volume in 2D 15N-13C spectra of Aβ40 fibrils derived from t-AD and PCA-AD tissue, and approximately 65% in 2D 15N-13C spectra of Aβ40 fibrils derived from r-AD tissue. 15N and 13C chemical shifts in our spectra of brain-seeded fibrils are compared with previously reported chemical shifts for Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils1,2,4,6,7,26–28 in the Supplementary Discussion and Extended Data Fig. 8.

We draw the following main conclusions from these ssNMR experiments: (i) Although brain-seeded Aβ40 fibrils can be polymorphic, a single structure is most abundant in cortical tissue of most t-AD patients and most PCA-AD patients; (ii) Polymorphism of Aβ40 fibrils is more pronounced in r-AD samples than in t-AD and PCA-AD samples; (iii) Brain-seeded Aβ42 fibrils are generally more structurally heterogeneous than brain-seeded Aβ40 fibrils, without a clearly predominant structure even in t-AD and PCA-AD samples. Although the small number of samples prevents us from drawing definite conclusions regarding fibril structures in ND brain tissue, we have not observed ssNMR signals that are unique to ND-derived fibrils.

2D ssNMR spectra of the predominant Aβ40 fibril structure, along with the fibril morphology in Fig. 1a, match data reported previously by Lu et al. for Aβ40 fibrils from one of their two AD patients.4 This patient, called “patient 2”, was a t-AD case. In contrast, Aβ40 fibrils from their “patient 1” exhibited distinctive ssNMR signals that are not present in any of the measurements described above (Extended Data Fig. 8). The clinical history of patient 1 was also different, including an initial diagnosis of Lewy body dementia rather than AD. Thus, it remains possible that the Aβ40 fibril structure of patient 1, for which a full molecular model was developed4, is associated with a specific AD variant.

The indistinguishability of Aβ fibrils from t-AD and PCA-AD tissue suggests that phenotypic differences between these two categories arise from factors other than fibril structure, perhaps including genetic factors or differences in nonfibrillar Aβ assemblies. The greater polymorphism of Aβ40 fibrils from r-AD tissue indicated by 2D ssNMR spectra has at least two possible interpretations: (i) A fibril structure that is prevalent in r-AD tissue has enhanced neurotoxicity, through either direct or indirect mechanisms; (ii) In r-AD samples, fibrils reside in the tissue for a shorter period than in t-AD and PCA-AD samples, possibly allowing fibrils with a greater range of thermodynamic stabilities or resistance to degradation to be present at autopsy.

The greater overall heterogeneity of Aβ42 fibrils seeded with t-AD and PCA-AD extract, compared with the corresponding Aβ40 fibrils, is conceivably a consequence of imperfect amplification of Aβ42 fibril structures from brain tissue under our experimental conditions, possibly due to a stronger tendency of the more hydrophobic Aβ42 peptide to spontaneously form nonfibrillar aggregates or due to the lower abundance of Aβ42 fibrils in most of our tissue samples (Extended Data Table 2). However, 2D ssNMR spectra of a control sample, in which Aβ42 fibrils were grown in the presence of extract from occipital tissue that lacked detectable fibril seeds, show surprisingly sharp crosspeak signals that indicate roughly 70% population of a single structure (Supplementary Discussion and Extended Data Fig. 4). Thus, the greater structural heterogeneity of AD brain-seeded Aβ42 fibrils in our experiments most likely indicates greater heterogeneity of the fibril seeds within the cortical tissue. Recent experiments by Cohen et al. indicate differences in structural heterogeneity and sizes of Aβ42 aggregates, but not Aβ40 aggregates, in r-AD and t-AD brain tissue.16

In conclusion, experiments described above represent the first use of ssNMR to screen multiple tissue samples for variations in amyloid fibril structure. Similar approaches can be applied in other amyloid diseases, where related phenomena exist.20,29,30 Obvious goals for future work are to develop a full structural model for the predominant Aβ40 polymorph identified above and to determine whether structurally distinct Aβ40 polymorphs can consistently seed different patterns of Aβ pathology in suitable animal models.
