A role for the Perlman syndrome exonuclease Dis3l2 in the Lin28-let-7 pathway

Abstract

The pluripotency factor Lin28 blocks the expression of let-7 microRNAs (miRNAs) in undifferentiated cells during development and functions as an oncogene in a subset of cancers1. Lin28 binds to let-7 precursor RNAs and recruits 3′ terminal uridylyl transferases (TUTases) to selectively inhibit let-7 biogenesis2–4. Uridylated pre-let-7 is refractory to processing by Dicer and is rapidly degraded by an unknown ribonuclease5. Here we identify Dis3l2 as the 3′-5′ exonuclease responsible for the decay of uridylated pre-let-7. Biochemical reconstitution assays reveal that 3′ oligouridylation stimulates Dis3l2 activity in vitro, and knockdown of Dis3l2 in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to the stabilization of pre-let-7. Our study establishes 3′ oligouridylation as an RNA decay signal for Dis3l2 and identifies the first physiological RNA substrate of this novel exonuclease that is mutated in the Perlman syndrome of fetal overgrowth and predisposition to Wilms’ tumor6.

Posttranscriptional gene regulation by miRNAs impacts many developmental and physiological processes. Functioning by base-pairing with target messenger RNAs of complementary sequence these ~22 nucleotides RNAs recruit the miRNA-induced silencing complex for translational repression and mRNA decay. Of particular relevance is the ancient let-7 family of miRNAs that are essential for normal development of C. elegans. Loss of their tumor suppressor function impacts various human cancers7. Let-7 expression is dynamically regulated during development by the paralogous RNA-binding proteins Lin28A and Lin28B5,8–10. Lin28 was identified as a regulator of developmental timing in worms, and more recently has been linked with controlling developmental timing and growth of mammals as well as maintaining glucose homeostasis1,11–13. Lin28 is a pluripotency factor in stem cells where its expression helps maintain an undifferentiated and proliferative state by blocking let-7 expression14,15. The Lin28-let-7 pathway is normally silenced in adult somatic cells yet expression of Lin28A or Lin28B is associated with a wide variety of human cancers16,17. Inhibition of this oncogenic pathway blocks the tumorigenicity of cancer cells16.

Recent work has provided insight into the mechanisms underlying the Lin28-mediated selective regulation of let-718. Lin28A functions in the cell cytoplasm where it recruits 3′ terminal uridylyl transferases (TUTase), Zcchc11 (TUT4) and Zcchc6 (TUT7), that adds an oligouridine tail to pre-let-7 to inhibit Dicer processing and is thought to serve as a signal for the rapid decay of the uridylated RNA by an unknown nuclease2–5,16. We sought to identify the downstream nuclease(s) and utilized a biochemical approach to isolate factors that specifically associate with uridylated pre-let-7 (Figure 1a, Supplementary Figure S1, and Supplementary Table 1). This analysis identified that Lin28A and Zcchc11 were associated with both RNAs whereas Dis3l2 [DIS3 mitotic control homolog (S. cerevisiae)-like 2], a 3′-5′ exonuclease, was specifically detected in the pre-let-7+14U purification (Figure 1b)6. These mass spectrometry data were confirmed by Western blot (Figure 1c). Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays using a mouse ESC line expressing Dox-inducible Flag-Lin28 transgene revealed that Zcchc11, Zcchc6, as well as Dis3l2 are detectable by Western blot in the Flag-Lin28A affinity eluate (Figure 1d). Additional co-IPs with Flag-TRBP, a cytoplasmic miRNA-binding protein, and Flag-Trim71, a cytoplasmic RNA binding protein highly expressed in ESCs, confirmed the specificity of the Dis3l2 association with Lin28 (Figure 1e)15,19. To address whether this association is mediated through RNA we performed additional co-IPs using either wild-type Lin28 or a mutant Lin28 (W46A) protein that exhibits compromised RNA binding activity towards pre-let-718. We found less Dis3l2 associated with mutant Lin28, and that this association is strongly reduced upon RNase A treatment (Figure 1f). Overall these results indicate that Lin28A associates with Dis3l2 in a RNA-dependent manner and implicate Dis3l2 as a possible nuclease in the Lin28-let-7 pathway.

We next cloned and sequenced Dis3l2 cDNA from ESCs. Dis3l2.2 was confirmed as the major transcript variant expressed in V6.5 ESC that encodes a 870 amino acid protein (Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure 2). Since pre-let-7 degradation occurs in the cell cytoplasm we next examined the subcellular localization of Dis3I2 in ESCs (Supplementary Figure 3). Dis3l2 was found to primarily localize to the cytoplasm of V6.5 ESC, which is consistent with other cell types6.

We carried out RNA degradation assays using affinity-purified Flag-Dis3l2. Dis3l2 was found to preferentially degrade pre-let-7+14U over non-uridylated pre-let-7 or an unrelated pre-miR-21 (Figure 2a). To rule out the possibility that this observed activity was due to a co-purifying nuclease in the Flag-Dis3l2 IP we generated a mutant Dis3l2-expressing construct by replacing a conserved residue in the catalytic domain (D389N) (Figure 1b). Mutation of the equivalent Aspartic Acid in yeast DIS3 (D551N) abolishes exonuclease activity without interfering with RNA binding20. Indeed Dis3l2 displayed no activity whereas affinity-purified Dis3l2 displayed preferential activity towards pre-let--7+14U (Figures 2b–c).

Next, to determine whether Dis3l2 is sufficient for the selective degradation of uridylated pre-let-7 we generated recombinant Dis3l2 protein in E. coli (Figure 2d). Although the activity of recombinant Dis3l2 (rDis3l2) was lower than that of the affinity-purified Flag-Dis3l2 complexes we observed a similar preference for pre-let-7+14U compared with the non-uridylated pre-let-7 using the 5 recombinant Dis3l2 protein (Figures 2e–f). To rule out the possibility that this observed activity was due to a bacterial nuclease that might co-purify with His-Dis3l2 we generated a mutant (D389N) rDis3l2 and confirmed that this catalytic mutant displayed no ribonuclease activity in these assays (Supplementary Figure 4a). Considering that uridylated pre-let-7a-1 was previously found associated with isolated Flag-Lin28A complexes together with our co-IP data, we next explored whether Lin28A protein influenced Dis3l2 activity in vitro5. This analysis revealed that Lin28A had no effect on Dis3l2 activity (Supplementary Figure 5). Next, to more quantitatively measure the substrate preference of Dis3l2 for uridylated pre-let-7 we performed time course experiments with rDis3l2. This revealed a strong preference for the degradation of uridylated pre-let-7 compared to non-uridylated pre-let-7, with >10-fold difference in the relative RNA stability in these assays (Figures 2g–h). Altogether these results reveal that purified recombinant Dis3l2 preferentially degrades uridylated pre-let-7 in vitro and the oligoU-tail serves as a decay signal for this ribonuclease.

To further explore the functional relationship between Lin28, TUTase, and Dis3l2-mediated RNA degradation we next performed in vitro reconstitution assays. Previously we showed that Lin28 enhances the uridylation activity of Zcchc11 towards pre-let-7. In these assays TUTase activity was measured by the incorporation of radiolabeled UTP3,4,16. However due to limiting UTP concentration the oligo-U tails added in these reactions are short, comprising only a few nucleotides. Indeed supplementing such reactions with additional (non-radiolabeled) UTP leads to the generation of longer U-tails (Figure 3a, compare lanes 1, 2, and 3). Interestingly, addition of Dis3l2 leads to the selective degradation of the pre-let-7 with longer U-tails (Figure 3a). These data define the minimal set of proteins and enzymes required to recapitulate the selective degradation of pre-let-7 observed in vivo, and raise questions regarding U-tail length requirements to stimulate Dis3l2-mediated degradation. To address this we prepared a panel of pre-let-7 RNA substrates with varying U-tail lengths and monitored Dis3l2 degradation activity. Tails of at least 10 uridines were found to stimulate Dis3l2 activity with maximal stimulation observed with U-tails of 14 or greater. This result is consistent with the average length the U-tail found on pre-let-7 RNAs cloned and sequenced from Lin28-expressing cells5.

To examine the Dis3l2 domain requirements we generated three deletion mutants lacking either the N-terminus, C-terminus, or both N and C-terminal regions (Figure 3d). RNA degradation assays and electromobility shift assays (EMSA) revealed that truncation of either the N- or the C-terminus region abrogated both Dis3l2 binding and nuclease activities on uridylated pre-let-7 RNA (Figures 3d–e). This suggests that both the cold-shock domain(s) as well as the S1 domain are required for binding to uridylated pre-let-7. Though the catalytic mutant (D389N) Dis3l2 was inactive in RNA degradation assays it retained the ability to selectively bind to uridylated pre-let-7 (Figure 3e and Supplementary Figure 4b). RNA degradation and binding assays using an unrelated RNA, pre-miR-21−/+14U, established the sufficiency of an oligo-U tail serving as a signal to trigger Dis3l2-mediated decay (Supplementary Figure 4c–d).

To examine the role of Dis3l2 in the let-7 pathway we used siRNAs to deplete Lin28A, Zcchc11, or Dis3l2 expression in mouse ESCs. We also included siRNAs that target a related family member Dis3l1 (Figure 4a–b). We monitored effects of gene knockdown on mature miRNA expression by q.RT-PCR and Northern blot (Figure 4c–d). While Lin28A knockdown caused the expected accumulation of multiple let-7 miRNAs, knockdown of Dis3l2 (or Dis3l1) had no effect. We did however observe a modest increase in let-7 expression in the Zcchc11-depleted samples as previously reported3–5. Uridylated pre-let-7 has been previously shown to be resistant to cleavage by affinity-purified Dicer complex(es) and consistently we found pre-let-7+14U to be a poor substrate for recombinant Dicer in processing assays. In comparison pre-let-7 was processed by Dicer to ~22 nt duplexes (Figure 4e). Considering that pre-let-7+14U is inefficiently processed by Dicer we postulated that knockdown of Dis3l2 in cells could lead to accumulation of uridylated pre-let-7 without affecting levels of mature let-7. To test this we developed a sensitive q.RT-PCR-based assay for the specific detection of uridylated pre-let-7. We used an oligo-dA primer for the reverse transcriptase first-strand cDNA synthesis step and used primers complementary to pre-let-7 for detection of uridylated pre-let-7 by real-time PCR. This approach allowed us to specifically detect uridylated pre-let-7 (Supplementary Figure 6a). RNA from the knockdown samples was size fractionated to specifically measure relative levels of uridylated pre-let-7 in the <200nt fraction and the corresponding pri-let-7 transcripts in the large >200nt fraction. This revealed the specific accumulation of uridylated pre-let-7a-1 and pre-let-7g upon Dis3l2 knockdown (Figure 4f), whereas levels of the corresponding pri-let-7 transcripts were unchanged (Figure 4g). PCR products were cloned and sequenced to confirm the specificity of this assay (Supplementary Figure 6b–c). Similar results were found using stable Dis3l2 knockdown ESCs (Supplementary Figure 7a–e). To further confirm the role of Dis3l2 in the regulation of uridylated pre-let-7 levels we performed Northern blot using a probe complementary to the terminal loop region of let-7g. This revealed a slower-migrating pre-let-7 band upon Dis3l2 depletion that likely corresponds to oligouridylated pre-let-7 (Figures 4h–i). Finally we individually depleted two additional 3′-5′ exonucleases, Exosc10 (RRP6) and Rrp44 (Dis3) from ESCs and measured relative pre-let-7 levels by q.RT-PCR. Knockdown of these exosome-associated nucleases did not affect uridylated pre-let-7 levels (Supplementary Figure 8). These results provide strong support that Dis3l2 is the downstream nuclease that mediates the decay of uridylated pre-let-7 in the Lin28 pathway.

Our results identify Dis3l2 as a new component of the Lin28/let-7 pathway as the downstream nuclease responsible for the decay of uridylated pre-let-7 (Supplementary Figure 9). This contention is based on the following: First, Dis3l2 specifically associates with uridylated pre-let-7 in RNA affinity-purifications and is detected as a component of a Lin28A-containing ribonucleoprotein complex(es). Second, purified Dis3l2 (but not catalytically inactive mutant Dis3l2) complexes display substrate preference for uridylated pre-let-7 in RNA degradation assays in vitro. Third, in vitro reconstitution experiments with recombinant Dis3l2 reveal the sufficiency of this enzyme for the preferential degradation of uridylated pre-let-7. Last, knockdown of Dis3l2 causes the specific accumulation of uridylated pre-let-7 in mouse ESCs.

Dis3l2 belongs to a family of related 3′-5′ exonucleases with similar domain organization to bacterial RNase II6,21,22. Interestingly germline mutations in the Dis3l2 gene were recently found to be responsible for Perlman syndrome, a rare, autosomal recessive, fetal overgrowth syndrome6. In addition to being large, affected individuals are hypotonic, have organomegally, characteristic facial dysmorphism, renal abnormalities, neurodevelopmental problems, and a dramatically high susceptibility Wilms’ tumors (Nephroblastoma) with >60% of surviving children developing Wilms’ tumors. Moreover Dis3l2 was found to be mutated in ~30% of sporadic Wilms’ tumors analyzed6. It will be important to explain the role of Dis3l2 in the genesis and development of Perlman syndrome and Wilms’ tumors. Future experiments with knockout mouse models will shed light on question. Our work uncovers the first physiologic RNA substrate of Dis3l2. Considering the similarities between the disease phenotypes associated with Dis3l2 deletion and those caused by Lin28 gain-of-function (i.e. overgrowth and tumorigenesis) it is tempting to speculate that this novel role of Dis3l2 in the Lin28-let-7 pathway is relevant to Perlman syndrome and cancer.

Our identification of a decay pathway for uridylated RNAs raises questions about how widespread this type of regulation might be on a transcriptome scale as well as the mechanism by which oligouridylation promotes Dis3l2 ribonucleolytic activity. So far there are few known examples where 3′ uridylation can serve as a decay signal; these include histone mRNA regulation during the mammalian cell cycle, and the widespread uridylation-dependent mRNA decapping and decay in Schizosaccharomyces pombe 23–25. This model has analogies with other systems; for example 3′-5′ RNA decay in E. coli by the ‘Degradosome’ is stimulated by short poly(A) tails26,27. Similarly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae the Trf4/Air2/Mtr4 polyadenylation (TRAMP) complex catalyzes the addition of oligoA-tail that promotes 3′-5′ RNA decay by the exosome as part of a nuclear RNA surveillance mechanism28,29. In the case of pre-let-7 the 3′ oligouridylation has two consequences; 1) to block Dicer processing, and 2) to stimulate decay by Dis3l2, therefore even though Dis3l2 displays relatively modest substrate preference for uridylated pre-let-7 in vitro, the two-step mechanism safeguards against the production of mature let-7 miRNA.

The mass spectrometric protein analysis was performed at the Proteomics Center at Boston Children’s Hospital. Bands of interest were excised from the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel, washed with a 2:1 ratio of 100mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile, reduced with 10 mM DTT at 56°C for 45 minutes and alkylated for 30 minutes at room temperature, in the dark, with 55mM Iodoacetamide. Samples were digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) at a concentration of 12.5ng/ul in 100mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37°C overnight. Peptides were extracted with 100mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile, and then dried in a speedvac. Samples were resuspended in 5 % acetonitrile and 5 % formic acid before direct injection into the LC/MS system comprising of a nanoLC AS-2 autosampler, a nanoLC 2D HPLC pump (both Eksigent, Dublin, CA), and an LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). The LC-system for the mass spectrometer featured an reversed phase column in-house packed into PicoTip Emitters (New Objective, Woburn, MA) using Magic C18 (3 um, 200 Å; Michrom Bioresource) packing material. The peptides were eluted with a 30 min linear gradient and data was acquired in a data dependent fashion, i.e. the 6 most abundant species were selected for fragmentation by collision induced dissociation. The .raw files were converted into .mgf files using in-house written scripts30. For each fragment ion spectrum, only the 200 most intense fragment ions were exported into the mgf file. The mass spectrometric data was searched against Uniprot-Mouse database using the protein identification software Protein Pilot. The results were then filtered to include only proteins with a global FDR of 1%.

Cleared lysates were incubated with Ni-NTA beads and after 90 minutes incubation at 4°C the beads were washed with 80 column volumes wash buffer [10mM Tris (pH 7.8), 50mM imidazole pH 8.0, 500mM NaCl, 0.1% PMSF). Bound His-tagged proteins were eluted from the column with 1 volume elution buffer [10mM Tris (pH 7.8), 500mM imidazole pH 8.0, 500mM NaCl, 0.1% fresh PMSF] and dialyzed overnight against BC100 [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol]. Purified protein was dialyzed against RNA degradation buffer (see below) and supplemented with 20% glycerol before storage at −80°C. For affinity purification of ectopically expressed FLAG-Lin28A or FLAG-Lin28A W46A, V6.5 ESC were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and collected 48 hours later.

The reactions were set up in the RNA degradation buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 0.05 mM MgCl , 1 mM DTT) and incubated at 37°C for 90 minutes. For time-course assays; recombinant 6x-His Dis3l2 was incubated with radiolabeled pre-let-7a-1 or pre-let-7a-1+14U. Bands from three independent experiments were quantified using ImageJ (NIH) and plotted using Prism (Graphpad). Values were fitted to one-phase decay curves with error bars representing +/− s.d.

mRNA and miRNA quantitative RT-PCR

Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For fractionation of less than 200 nucleotides (nt) long RNA, total RNA was processed by mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Cat# AM1560, Ambion). For mRNA, 100 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamers and SuperScript III (Invitrogen). For mature miRNA, 10 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using gene-specific stem-loop RT primers and Multiscribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). For pre-miRNA, 1 μg of less than 200 nt fractionated RNA was first treated with 0.66 unit of RNase-free DNase (Promega) (60 min at 37°C), stopped with 1 mM of EDTA (10 min at 65°C), and reverse transcribed by oligo(dA)  (60 min at 50°C) using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was further digested with RNase H (30 min at 37°C). For mRNA and pre-miRNA, iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) was used for quantitating the cDNA. For mature-miRNA, TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, No AmpErase UNG (Applied Biosystems) was used for cDNA detection. All quantitative PCR were performed using iCycler iQ Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Normalization controls include ACTB for mRNAs as well as for primiRNAs, U6 for pre-miRNA, and snoRNA142 for mature miRNAs. For all RT-PCRs, minus reverse transcriptase (-RT) and water control samples were included and in all cases the signals were undetectable (data not shown). The primer sequences used in this study are listed in Table 4.
