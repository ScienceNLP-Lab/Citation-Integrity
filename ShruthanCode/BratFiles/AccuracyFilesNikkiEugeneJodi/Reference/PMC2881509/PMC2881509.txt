Transcriptional evidence for the "Reverse Warburg Effect" in human                         breast cancer tumor stroma and metastasis: Similarities with oxidative stress,                         inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, and "Neuron-Glia Metabolic Coupling"

Abstract

                      Caveolin-1                         (-/-) null stromal cells are a novel genetic model for cancer-associated                         fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Here, we used an unbiased informatics                         analysis of transcriptional gene profiling to show that Cav-1 (-/-)                         bone-marrow derived stromal cells bear a striking resemblance to the                         activated tumor stroma of human breast cancers. More specifically, the                         transcriptional profiles of Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells were most closely                         related to the primary tumor stroma of breast cancer patients that had                         undergone lymph-node (LN) metastasis. This is consistent with previous                         morphological data demonstrating that a loss of stromal Cav-1 protein (by                         immuno-histochemical staining in the fibroblast compartment) is                         significantly associated with increased LN-metastasis. We also provide                         evidence that the tumor stroma of human breast cancers shows a                         transcriptional shift towards oxidative stress, DNA damage/repair,                         inflammation, hypoxia, and aerobic glycolysis, consistent with the "Reverse                         Warburg Effect".  Finally, the tumor stroma of "metastasis-prone" breast                         cancer patients was most closely related to the transcriptional profiles                         derived from the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This suggests                         that certain fundamental biological processes are common to both an activated                         tumor stroma and neuro-degenerative stress.  These processes may include oxidative                         stress, NO over-production (peroxynitrite formation), inflammation, hypoxia, and                         mitochondrial dysfunction, which are thought to occur in Alzheimer's disease                         pathology.  Thus, a loss of Cav-1 expression in cancer-associated myofibroblasts                         may be a protein biomarker for oxidative stress, aerobic glycolysis, and                         inflammation, driving the "Reverse                         Warburg Effect" in the tumor micro-environment                         and cancer cell metastasis.                  

Introduction

Recently, we identified a loss of stromal caveolin-1                         (Cav-1) as a novel biomarker for the cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype in                         human breast cancers [1].  More specifically, when fibroblasts were isolated                         from human breast cancers, 8 out of 11 patients showed >2-fold reduction in                         Cav-1 protein expression, relative normal matched fibroblasts prepared from the                         same patients [1].  Furthermore, detailed phenotypic analysis of mammary                         fibroblasts derived from Cav-1 (-/-) null mice revealed that they share                         numerous properties with cancer-associated fibroblasts, such as constitutively                         active TGFbeta signaling, and that they have the ability to promote normal                         mammary epithelial cells to undergo an EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition)                         [2].                                  

To determine if loss of stromal Cav-1 has prognostic                         value, we performed a series of independent biomarker studies [3,4].  Using a                         cohort of 160 breast cancer patients, with nearly 20 years of follow-up data,                         we showed that a loss of stromal Cav-1 (in the fibroblast compartment) is a                         powerful single independent predictor early tumor recurrence, lymph node                         metastasis, tamoxifen-resistance, and poor clinical outcome [4].  As the                         prognostic value of a loss of stromal Cav-1 was independent of epithelial                         marker status, it appears that a loss of Cav-1 has predictive value in all the                         different epithelial subtypes of human breast cancer, including ER+, PR+,                         HER2+, and triple-negative patients [4].  The high predictive value of a loss                         of stromal Cav-1 was also independently validated by another independent                         laboratory, using a second independent breast cancer patient cohort [5].                                  

A loss of stromal Cav-1 also appears to                         play a role in tumor initiation and progression [6]. Using a DCIS patient                         cohort, in which patients were treated with wide-excision, but without any                         chemo- or radio-therapy, we also evaluated the prognostic value of stromal                         Cav-1 [6].  In this DCIS patient cohort, a loss of stromal Cav-1 was                         specifically associated with DCIS recurrence and invasive progression.  100% of                         the patients with a loss of stromal Cav-1 underwent recurrence, and 80% of                         these patients progressed to invasive disease, namely frank invasive ductal carcinoma [6]. Similar  results were also independently obtained in human prostate cancers,                         where a loss of stromal Cav-1 was specifically associated with advanced                         prostate cancer, tumor progression, and metastatic disease [7].                                  

To begin to understand the mechanism(s) underlying the                         lethality of a loss of Cav-1 in cancer-associated fibroblasts, we turned to                         Cav-1 (-/-) deficient mice as a model system.                                  

For this purpose, we isolated bone marrow derived                         stromal cells from WT and Cav-1 (-/-) deficient mice, as cancer-associated                         fibroblasts are thought to evolve from mesenchymal stem cells [8]. These cells                         were then subjected to unbiased proteomic and genome-wide transcriptional                         analysis.  Interestingly, proteomic analysis revealed the upregulation of i) 8                         myofibroblast markers (including vimentin, calponin, and tropomyosin), ii) 8                         glycolytic enzymes (including PKM2 and LDHA), and iii) 2 markers of oxidative                         stress (peroxiredoxin1 and catalase) [8]. The glycolytic phenotype of Cav-1                         (-/-) null stromal cells was also supported by transcriptional analysis, as                         most of the proteins that were found to be upregulated by proteomics, were also                         transcriptionally upregulated [8]. Based on these findings, we proposed a new                         model to understand the role of the Warburg effect ("aerobic glycolysis") in                         tumor metabolism. We hypothesized that glycolytic cancer-associated fibroblasts                         promote tumor growth by the secretion of energy-rich metabolites (such as                         pyruvate and lactate) that could then be taken up by adjacent epithelial cancer                         cells, where they would be incorporated into the tumor cell's TCA cycle,                         leading to enhanced ATP production [8]. This would provide a feed-forward                         mechanism by which glycolytic fibroblasts could promote tumor growth,                         progression, and metastasis. Because the Warburg effect was previously thought                         to be largely confined to tumor cells, and not to the cancer-associated                         fibroblast compartment, we have termed this new idea "The Reverse Warburg                         Effect" [8].                                  

In order to determine which transcriptional programs                         are activated in Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells, we performed an extensive                         bioinformatics analysis of our genome-wide profiling data [9]. This informatics                         analysis revealed that a loss of Cav-1 (-/-) in stromal cells drives ROS                         production and oxidative stress [9]. This, in turn, results in the activation                         of key transcription factor, such as HIF and NF-kB, which can then drive                         aerobic glycolysis and inflammation in the tumor micro-environment [9]. This                         could provide a molecular basis for understanding the lethality of a loss of                         stromal Cav-1 in human breast cancer patients.                                  

Here, we have used a bioinformatics approach to                         determine whether similar "Warburg-like" transcrip-tional profiles exist in the                         tumor stroma isolated from human breast cancers.  For this purpose, we analyzed                         an existing data set in which the tumor stroma was isolated away from adjacent                         breast cancer cells using laser-capture micro-dissection [10].  We now provide                         new evidence for the existence of the "Reverse Warburg Effect" in human tumor stroma                         from breast cancer patients. More specifically, the tumor stroma of human                         breast cancers shows a transcriptional shift towards oxidative stress, DNA                         damage/repair, inflammation, hypoxia, and aerobic glycolysis, supporting with                         the "Reverse Warburg Effect". Consistent with the idea that oxidative stress in                         the tumor stroma is a driving factor in promoting tumor progression and                         metastasis, we also show that the tumor stroma of human breast cancers overlaps                         significantly with the transcriptional profiles associated with Alzheimer's                         brain disease.                                  

Finally, the "Reverse Warburg Effect" is strikingly                         similar to the theory of "Neuon-Glia Metabolic Coupling" [11-18], which was                         proposed more than 10 years ago to explain metabolic changes associated with                         normal synaptic transmission, which may be exacerbated during neuronal stress                         and neuronal degeneration, as in Alzheimer's disease. In "Neuron-Glia Metabolic                         Coupling", astrocytes undergo aerobic glycolysis, secrete energy-rich                         metabolites (pyruvate and lactate), and neurons then take up these metabolites                         and use them in the neuronal TCA cycle to generate high amounts of ATP. Thus,                         we propose that "The Reverse Warburg Effect" we observe could also be more                         broadly termed "Epithelial-Stromal Metabolic Coupling".                                  

As such, tumors may be initiating a                         survival mechanism that is normally used by the brain during stress.                         Interestingly, myofibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells are known to often                         express GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) [19-21], an intermediate                         filament protein that is thought to be relatively specific for astrocytes in                         the central nervous system. Here, we see that GFAP is upregulated in the "tumor                         stroma" and in the stroma of "metastasis-prone" breast cancer patients. Thus,                         possible similarities between astrocytes and myo-fibroblasts/cancer-associated                         fibroblasts should be further explored.                                  

Results

Transcriptional                             comparison of Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells with human breast cancer stroma                          

Previously, we subjected                             Cav-1 (-/-) bone marrow derived stromal cells, and their wild-type                             counter-parts to genome-wide transcriptional profiling [8].  Because such a                             large number of gene transcript levels are changed, we focused on the gene                             transcripts that are upregulated. We speculated that these Cav-1 (-/-) stromal                             gene profiles might also overlap with the transcriptional stromal profiles                             obtained from human breast cancers.                                          

To test this hypothesis                             directly, we obtained the transcriptional profiles of a large data set of human                             breast cancer patients [10] whose tumors were subjected to laser-capture                             micro-dissection, to selectively isolate the tumor stroma. Based on this data                             set [10], we then generated three human breast cancer stromal genes lists:                                              

1)  - Compares the transcriptional profiles of tumor stroma                             obtained 53 patients to normal stroma obtained from 38 patients. Genes                             transcripts that were consistently upregulated in tumor stroma were selected                             and assigned a p-value, with a cut-off of p <0.05 (contains 6,777 genes) (Supplementary                             Table 1).                                          

2)  -                             Compares the transcript-tional profiles of tumor stroma obtained from 11 patients                             with tumor recurrence to the tumor stroma of 42 patients without tumor                             recurrence. Genes transcripts that were consistently upregulated in the tumor                             stroma of patients with recurrence were selected and assigned a p-value, with a                             cut-off of p <0.05 (contains 3,354 genes) (Supplementary Table 2).                                          

3) - Compares the transcriptional                             profiles of tumor stroma obtained from 25 patients with LN metastasis to the                             tumor stroma of 25 patients without LN metastasis. Genes transcripts that were                             consistently upregulated in the tumor stroma of patients with LN metastasis                             were selected and assigned a p-value, with a cut-off of p <0.05 (contains                             1,182 genes)  Supplementary Table 3).                                          

These                             three gene lists were then individually intersected with the transcriptional                             profile of Cav-1 (-/-) null stromal cells [8]. The results of these                             intersections are presented in Figure 1, as                             Venn diagrams. Most important- ly, significant overlap was seen with all                             three gene lists. Greater than 2,000 genes were common between the Cav-1 (-/-)                             stromal gene list and the gene transcripts upregulated in breast cancer tumor                             stroma (p = 1.6 x 10-3).  Also, more than 1,000 gene transcripts                             were common between the Cav-1 (-/-) stromal gene list and the gene transcripts                             upregulated in the breast cancer tumor stroma of patients with tumor recurrence                             (p = 1 x 10-3). Finally, nearly 500 genes were commonly upregulated                             between Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells and the breast cancer tumor stroma of                             patients with LN metastasis (p = 4.6 x 10-6).  Thus, the                             transcriptional profiles of Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells are most  ignificantly                             related to the tumor stroma of patients with LN-metastasis. Independently, our                             previous data demonstrated that a loss of stromal Cav-1 protein expression (by                             immuno-histochemistry) in human breast cancers is specifically associated with                             a 2.6-fold increase in the number of tumor cell positive lymph nodes                             (LN-metastasis) [3,4].                                          

The top 100 most significant gene transcripts for all                             three human breast cancer stromal gene lists, including their transcriptional                             intersection with Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells, is included in Supplementary                             Tables 3, 4, and 5.                                          

As Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells are a genetic model of                             activated myofibroblasts [2] which biosynthetically secrete more collagen, and                             fibrosis is a critical risk factor for poor clinical outcome in human breast                             cancer patients [3], we also looked at the potential overlap been the expression                             of collagen gene transcripts (See Table 1). Thirty-five collagen gene                             transcripts were specifically upregulated in tumor stroma; 16 were upregulated                             in "recurrence-prone" stroma; and only 1 was upregulated in "metastasis-prone"                             stroma.  In all three cases, there was striking overlap with the collagen gene                             transcripts upregulated in Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells, as indicated in bold (24                             out of 35 transcripts; 12 out of 16 transcripts; and 1 out of 1 transcript; See                             Table 1).                                          

Cav-1                             (-/-) stromal cells have also been previously subjected to extensive analysis                             via an unbiased proteomics approach [8,24].   We next intersected these                             proteomic results with the three human breast cancer stromal gene lists.  The                             results of this intersection are shown in Table 2. Note that many of the                             proteins that are upregulated in Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells are also                             transcriptionally upregulated in the stroma of human breast cancer patients.                             Most notably, there was a strong association between the metabolic enzymes that                             were upregulated in Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells and the "recurrence-prone" and                             "metastasis-prone" stromal gene lists.                                          

Validating the "Reverse                             Warburg Hypothesis" in human breast cancer stroma                         

Recently,                             based on the unbiased proteomic and transcriptional analysis of Cav-1 (-/-)                             stromal cells, we have proposed that tumor stromal fibroblasts may undergo                             aerobic glycolysis [8]. We have termed this new idea the "Reverse Warburg                             Effect" [8].                                          

Transcriptional                             analysis of Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells [9] indicated that the "Reverse Warburg                             Effect" is associated with transcriptional over-expression of                             glycolysis-associated genes, HIF-target genes [25], NF-kB target genes [26],                             genes associated with the response to oxidative stress                             (GO_0006979), as well as the concomitant                             compensatory transcriptional upregulation of mitochondrial associated genes (GO_0005739) [9].                                          

Table 3 shows that all of these gene sets are well-represented in tumor stroma,                             "recurrence-prone" stroma, and the "metastasis-prone" stroma of human breast                             cancer patients (See also SupplmentalTables 7, 8, and 9 for detailed                             gene lists).                                          

It is important to note that these breast cancer stromal gene lists also include                             Cxcl12, a known HIF-target gene [25], that is transcriptionally-upregulated                             ~5-fold in Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells [8].                                          

The "Reverse Warburg Effect" and similarities with Alzheimer's disease                         

We have previously shown that the transcriptional profiles of Cav-1 (-/-) stromal                             cells significantly ovelap with the transcriptional profiles obtained from the                             analysis of Alzheimers disease brain [9]. We believe this is functionally due                             to the activation of similar biological processes in both "The Reverse Warburg                             Effect" and Alzheimer's disease [9], including oxidative stress, NO                             over-production (peroxynitrite formation), inflammation, hypoxia, and                             mitochondrial dysfunction [27].                                          

Thus, here, we independently evaluated the association                             between Alzheimer's disease and human breast cancer tumor stroma. These                             transcriptional overlaps are enumerated in Table 3, and are illustrated                             schematically as Venn diagrams in Figure 2.  Detailed gene lists are provided                             in Supplemental Tables 7, 8, and 9.                                          

Interestingly, as predicted, the genes that are                             transcriptionally upregulated in Alzheimer's disease significantly overlap with                             tumor stroma, "recurrence-prone" stroma, and "metastasis-prone" stroma. This                             clearly functionally links Alzheimer's disease with the human breast cancer                             tumor stroma.                                          

As with the gene profiles of Cav-1 (-/-) stromal                             cells, the Alzheimer's disease profiles were most significantly associated with the "metastasis-prone" stromal gene                             set (p = 9 x 10-5).                                          

Detailed analysis of the "Metastasis-Prone" stromal gene set                         

Next, we examined the possible overlap of the                             "metastasis-prone" stromal gene set with other existing transcriptional                             profiles, using gene-set enrichment analysis.                                          

Our results are shown in Table 4.                              Briefly, we see that the "metastasis-prone" stromal gene set is associated with                             a number of interesting biological processes, including cell cycle progression                             and survival, DNA damage/repair, scleroderma, "stemness", aging and oxidative                             stress, Alzheimer's disease, decreased DNA-methylation, tamoxifen-resistance,                             metastasis, Myc-associated target genes, inflammation (NF-kB/STAT), TGFbeta                             signaling and myofibroblast differentiation, hypoxia and HIF signaling,                             mitochondrial function, and liver-specific gene transcription.                                          

We                             have independently shown that many of these same biological processes are                             activated in Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells [9], consistent with the idea that Cav-1                             (-/-) stromal cells are a valid model for exploring the tumor-promoting effects                             of an activated tumor stromal micro-environment.                                          

Similarities of                             the Cav-1 (-/-) stromal gene set with transcriptional profiling data from ER-negative                             breast cancer                         

A comparison of the Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cell gene set with other existing                             transcriptional profiles also shows significant overlap with ER-negative human                             breast cancer (p = 8.96 x 10-10; BRCA_ER_NEG [28]). For this overlap                             analysis, UP genes from the Cav-1 (-/-) stromal data set with a fold-change of  2.0                              (KO/WT) and a P value of  0.1 were utilized for comparison with                             existing gene sets in the data base.                                          

Interestingly, these tumors                             were not laser-capture micro-dissected, so this provides an indication that the                             Cav-1 (-/-) stromal gene set may also be well represented in the                             transcriptional profiles obtained from whole tumors. A HeatMap containing these                             intersecting genes is shown in Figure 3 (205 overlapping genes; FC  1.5;                             p  0.05). See also Supplementary Tables.                                          

These include key                             overlapping genes associated with                               (Acot7, Acsl4, Eno1, Gapdh, Ldhb, Mtrf1l, Pfkl, Pgk1, Pgm2, Pgm3, Slc2a5,                             Slc2a6),  (Hyou1),                               (Aif1, C3, Ccl5, Crlf3, Ifngr1, Il10ra, Irak1, Irf5, Isg20, Nfib, Nfkbie, Nos3,                             Tnfaip3, Tnfrsf21, Tnfsf13b, Traf1),   (Actl6a, Capg, Col9a3, Dnmt3b, Mmp9, Myo10,                             Spock2, Tgfbi, Tgm1, Timp2), as well as                               (Ddit3, Rad54l).  These results are consistent with the existence of the                             "Reverse Warburg Effect" in ER-negative breast cancers.                                          

Interestingly, it has been previously demonstrated that key secreted inflammatory factors, such as Aif1                             (allograft inflammatory factor-1) (upregulated nearly 3-fold in Cav-1 (-/-)                             stromal cells; Supplementary Tables) promote NFkB-activation, the paracrine                             growth of ER-negative breast cancer cells [29], and are involved in the                             pathogenesis of pro-fibrotic diseases, such as scleroderma (systemic sclerosis)                             [30-32].                                          

Similarly, Aif1 expression                             is highly-upregulated in the tumor stroma of human breast cancers (See Supplementary                             Table 1; p = 8.35 x 10-24).                                          

Discussion

Here, we provide compelling                         transcriptional evidence for the "Reverse Warburg Effect" in human breast                         cancer tumor stroma. Using an unbiased informatics analysis of transcriptional                         gene profiling, we show that Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells bear a striking resemblance                         to the activated tumor stroma of human breast cancers. More specifically, the                         transcriptional profiles of Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells were most closely related                         to the stroma of breast cancer patients that had undergone LN-metastasis. This                         is consistent with our previous data showing that a loss of stromal Cav-1                         protein expression (by immuno-histochemistry) in human breast cancer tumor                         micro-arrays is specifically associated with increased LN-metastasis [3,4].                                  

Moreover, we provide                         evidence that the tumor stroma of human breast cancers shows a transcriptional                         shift towards oxidative stress, DNA damage/repair, inflammation, hypoxia, and                         aerobic glycolysis. These findings are consistent with the "Reverse Warburg                         Effect" [8,9]. Notably, the tumor stroma of "metastasis-prone" breast cancer                         patients was also closely related to the transcriptional profiles derived from                         the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. As such, certain fundamental                         biological processes are common to both an activated tumor stroma and                         neuro-degenerative stress.  These key biological processes most likely                         include oxidative stress, NO over-production (peroxynitrite formation),                         inflammation, hypoxia, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are all thought to                         drive Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.                                  

Thus,                         we avidly reviewed the literature regarding theories of neuronal functioning,                         neuronal stress, and neuro-degeneration, in the central nervous system and we                         stumbled upon the idea of "Neuron-Glia Metabolic Coupling" [11-18]  In                         this model, first proposed over 10 years ago, astrocytes shift towards aerobic                         glycolyis, secrete pyruvate and lactate, which is then taken-up by adjacent                         neurons and then "feeds" into the neuronal TCA cycle, resulting in increased                         neuronal oxidative mitochondrial metabolism, and higher ATP production in                         neurons. In essence, the astrocytes would function as support cells to "feed"                         the adjacent neuronal cells. Thus, "Neuron-Glia Metabolic Coupling" and the                         "Reverse Warburg Effect" are analogous                         biological processes, where the astrocytes are the cancer-associated                         fibroblasts and the neurons are the epithelial tumor cells.  As such, we                         propose that the "Reverse Warburg Effect" could also be more generally termed                         "Epithelial-Stromal Metabolic Coupling"                         or "Epithelial-Fibroblast Metabolic Coupling".                                  

If                         these two processes are indeed analogous, then epithelial tumor cells have                         already learned to behave as neurons, using the stroma as a means of support                         and nourishment. Figure 4 directly compares "Neuron-Glia Metabolic Coupling"                         with the "Reverse Warburg effect" schematically.                                  

Myofibroblasts and                         mesenchymal stem cells are known to often express GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic                         protein) [19-21], an intermediate filament protein that is thought to be                         relatively specific for astrocytes in the central nervous system.  Table 5                         shows that GFAP and other glial-related gene transcripts are indeed upregulated                         in "tumor stroma" and in the stroma of "metastasis-prone" breast cancer                         patients. Thus, possible metabolic and functional                         similarities between CNS astrocytes and myofibroblasts/cancer-associated                         fibroblasts should be further explored.                                  

Interestingly, in "Neuron-Glia                         Metabolic Coupling" the glycolytic shift in astrocytes is thought to be                         mediated by the secretion of glutamate (a neurotransmitter) from neurons. Then,                         astrocytes take up glutamate via high affinity sodium-dependent glutamate                         transporters, such as  . Importantly, one of                         these two glial-specific glutamate transporters ( ) is also                         transcriptionally over-expressed in the stroma of human breast cancer patients                         (Table 5). As such, the similarities between brain astrocytes,                         myofibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and tumor stromal cells may be more                         extensive than we previously appreciated.                                  

Methods of analysis

   In the Venn diagram of Figure 1, we show the                         intersections between the set of genes that are upregulated in Cav-1 (-/-)                         versus wild-type stromal cells [8] and three breast cancer gene sets [10].                                  

(a)        the set of stromal genes that are                         upregulated in breast cancer tumor patients versus normal breast stroma; (b)        the set of stromal genes that are                         upregulated in recurrence positive versus recurrence negative breast cancer                         patients (c)        the set of stromal genes that are                         upregulated in lymph-node metastasis positive versus lymph-node metastasis                         negative breast cancer patients.                                  

In the Venn diagram of Figure 2, we show the                         intersections between the set of genes that are upregulated in Alzheimer's                         brain disease [22] and the sets of genes (a)-(c) listed above. The p-values                         determining the significance of upregulation for each gene were computed using                         a one-sided t-test statistic (Tables 1, 2, and 5). For each pair (X,Y) of sets                         of genes, we also computed the probability (p-value) that the size of their                         intersection is less than or equal to the size of the intersection between set                         X and a randomly-chosen set of size equal to the size of set Y. This                         probability was calculated by applying the cumulative density function of the                         hypergeometric distribution on the size of set X, the size of set Y, the                         observed overlap between X and Y, and the total number of available genes.                                  

   For the functional analysis presented in Table 4, we                         used data from the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB [23]) which comprises                         a collection of gene sets: - collected from various sources such as online                         pathway databases, publications, and knowledge of domain experts, - comprising genes that share a conserved                         cis-regulatory motif across the human, mouse, rat, and dog genomes, - identified as co-regulated gene clusters by mining                         large collections of cancer-oriented microarray data, and - annotated by a common Gene Ontology (GO) term.                                  

For our analysis we used the latest release of MSigDB                         database v2.5 (April 7, 2008), after converting all the gene names in the                         database into RefSeq gene IDs. After this preprocessing step, we chose the                         sub-collection of gene sets that was relevant to our study, and for each gene                         set X in that sub-collection, we computed the overlap between X and the set of                         genes Y that are upregulated in lymph-node metastasis positive versus                         lymph-node metastasis negative breast cancer patients (p-value ≤0.05).                         Then, we computed the probability (p-value) of the observed overlap between                         sets X and Y as described in the "Venn diagrams" section.

                                         In "Neuron-Glia Metabolic Coupling", astrocytes take up more glucose, shift towards aerobic                                         glycolyis, secrete pyruvate and lactate, which is then taken up by adjacent                                         neurons and then "feeds" into the neuronal TCA cycle, resulting in                                         increased neuronal oxidative mitochondrial metabolism, and higher ATP                                         production in neurons. In essence, the astrocytes function as support cells                                         to "feed" the adjacent neuronal cells. This schematic diagram shows that                                         "Neuron-Glia Metabolic Coupling" and the "Reverse Warburg Effect" are                                         analogous biological processes, where the astrocytes are the                                         cancer-associated fibroblasts and the neurons are the epithelial tumor cells.  Thus, the "Reverse Warburg Effect"                                         could also be more generally termed "Epithelial-Stromal Metabolic Coupling"                                         or "Epithelial-Fibroblast Metabolic Coupling".
