Dietary emulsifiers impact the mouse gut microbiota promoting colitis and metabolic syndrome
Summary

The intestinal tract is inhabited by a large diverse community of microbes collectively referred to as gut microbiota. While gut microbiota provide important benefits to its host, especially in metabolism and immune development, disturbance of the microbiota-host relationship is associated with numerous chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the group of obesity-associated diseases collectively referred to as metabolic syndrome. A primary means by which the intestine is protected from its microbiota is via multilayered mucus structures that cover the intestinal surface thus allowing the vast majority of gut bacteria to be kept at a safe distance from epithelial cells that line the intestine 1. Thus, agents that disrupt mucus-bacterial interactions might have the potential to promote diseases associated with gut inflammation. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that emulsifiers, detergent-like molecules that are a ubiquitous component of processed foods and that can increase bacterial translocation across epithelia in vitro 2, might be promoting the post-mid 20th century increase in IBD 3. Herein, we observed that, in mice, relatively low concentrations of two commonly used emulsifiers, namely carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate-80, induced low-grade inflammation and obesity/metabolic syndrome in WT hosts and promoted robust colitis in mice predisposed to this disorder. Emulsifier-induced metabolic syndrome was associated with microbiota encroachment, altered species composition, and increased pro-inflammatory potential. Use of germ-free mice and fecal transplants indicated that such changes in microbiota were necessary and sufficient for both low-grade inflammation and metabolic syndrome. These results support the emerging concept that perturbed host-microbiota interactions resulting in low-grade inflammation can promote adiposity and its associated metabolic effects. Moreover, they suggest that broad use of emulsifying agents might be contributing to increased societal incidence of obesity/metabolic syndrome and other chronic inflammatory diseases.

Mice were administered the emulsifiers carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) or polysorbate-80 (P80), via drinking water (1.0% w/v or v/v, respectively) for 12 weeks. P80 has been studied for toxicity and carcinogenic potential 2,4,5 and is approved by the U.S. food and drug administration (FDA) for use in select foods at up to 1.0%. CMC has not been extensively studied but is deemed “generally regarded as safe (GRAS)” and used in various foods at up to 2.0% 3,6. We utilized wild-type (WT) C57Bl/6 mice and 2 engineered strains of mice, namely IL10−/− and TLR5−/−, that are prone to developing shifts in microbiota composition and inflammation 7,8. While observations that loss of TLR function alters microbiota composition and promotes inflammation was suggested to be an artifact of mouse husbandry practices 9, that epithelial cell specific deletion of TLR5 altered microbiota composition relative to WT siblings and resulted in low-grade inflammation/metabolic syndrome indicates that, at least for TLR5, this is not the case 10.

Confocal microscopy, using mucus-preserving Carnoy fixation 1,11 indicated that the closest bacteria resided, on average, about 25 μm from epithelial cells with no bacteria observed within 10 μm ( ). In contrast, emulsifier-treated mice exhibited some bacteria in apparent contact with the epithelium while the average distance was reduced by more than 50% ( ). Such microbiota encroachment correlated with reduced mucus thickness; not correlated with altered expression of Muc2 ( ). Both IL10−/− and TLR5−/− mice exhibited basal microbiota encroachment that was enhanced by both CMC and P80 ( ). ( ). Emulsifiers did not affect total levels of fecal bacteria in WT, IL10−/−, or TLR5−/− mice but resulted in more than a 2-fold increase in bacteria adherent to the colons of WT and IL10−/− mice ( ). Moreover, interrogation of microbiota composition via 16S RNA sequencing, followed by phylogenic analysis, and use of the unweighted UniFrac algorithm to compare community structure 12, revealed that both CMC and P80 dramatically altered microbiota composition in both fecal and intestinal-adherent bacteria of WT, IL10−/−, and TLR5−/− mice ( ).

In order to verify that differences in microbiota composition were a consequence of emulsifier treatment rather than simply reflecting that mice shared cages during treatment, which results in microbiota composition clustering in coprophagic animals, multiple litters were split equally into groups that were to receive water, CMC or P80 (3 separate cages per condition as schematized in  ). As expected, this experimental design avoided pre-treatment clustering. Yet, microbiota composition clustered strongly following treatment irrespective of cage clustering in both male and female mice in WT and TLR5−/− genotypes ( , confirming that emulsifiers alter microbiota composition.

Alterations in microbiota composition included reduced levels of Bacteroidales, associated with health13-15, and increased levels several mucolytic OTU including Ruminococcus gnavus 16 ( ). In IL10−/− mice, both CMC and P80 induced a marked reduction in microbial diversity, bloom in Verrucomicrobia phyla, especially Akkermansia muciniphila ( ) 17, and enriched mucosa-associated inflammation-promoting Proteobacteria 18,19. Emulsifier-induced changes in microbiota composition were sufficiently uniform such that a low number of OTUs (<15) afforded reliable prediction of emulsifier treatment ( ). Such distinguishing OTUs were spread across the Bacteria domain and several were common to all 3 host genotypes.

While most experiments herein utilized young mice (4 weeks-old at start of experiment) based on the notion that microbiota are more prone to disturbance at an early age 18,20, administration of emulsifiers beginning at 4 months of age also destabilized and altered microbiota composition ( ). Specifically, both CMC and P80 resulted in decreased alpha diversity and reduced stability, as evidenced by increased extent of week-to-week changes in principal coordinates, and greater extent of change over the course of the experiment that outweighed effects of cage clustering ( ). Thus, emulsifiers can alter gut microbiota composition of hosts of a broad age range.

Microbiota composition influences ability of a microbiota to activate innate immune signaling 21. Thus, we measured the capacity of feces from control and emulsifier-treated mice to activate pro-inflammatory gene expression via the LPS and flagellin receptors TLR4 and 5, respectively. Exposure to emulsifiers increased fecal levels of bioactive LPS and flagellin in WT, IL10−/−, and TLR5−/− mice ( ). Emulsifier treatment also increased gut permeability in WT and IL10−/− mice ( ), which correlated with increased levels of serum antibodies to flagellin and LPS ( ) thought to reflect gut permeability 22. Thus, chronic exposure to dietary emulsifiers results in erosion of the protective function of the mucus, increased bacterial adherence, and a more pro-inflammatory microbiota.

The hallmark of active colitis is the presence of immune cell infiltrates, which is typically paralleled by changes in gross colon morphology, elevated levels of the leukocyte enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), and pro-inflammatory markers. Based on such criteria, emulsifiers promoted the extent and incidence of colitis in both IL10−/− and TLR5−/− mice ( ). Emulsifiers did not induce overt colitis in WT mice but did result in subtle histopathologic and gross evidence of chronic intestinal inflammation including epithelial damage and shortened colons ( ). Fecal lipocalin-2 (Lcn-2) is a sensitive and broadly dynamic marker of intestinal inflammation in mice 23. Emulsifier-treated WT mice exhibited modestly-elevated fecal Lcn-2 levels 4 weeks following initial exposure ( ). In IL10−/− and TLR5−/− mice, basally elevated fecal Lcn-2 levels were further markedly elevated (about 10-fold) by 12 weeks of exposure to CMC and P80 ( ). Such robust colitis in IL10−/−, but not TLR5−/−, correlated with Bilophila and Helicobacter enrichment, analogous to previous observations in IL10−/− mice ( ) 24,25. The extent of inflammation inversely correlated with bacterial-epithelial distance in both WT and IL-10−/− mice ( ). Thus, emulsifiers may promote robust colitis in susceptible hosts and induce low-grade inflammation in WT hosts.

Metabolic syndrome is associated with, and may be promoted by, low-grade inflammation 26, Thus, we examined whether emulsifier-induced microbial dysbiosis and low-grade inflammation might promote this disorder in WT mice. Both CMC and P80 resulted in modest but significant gains in overall weight and a marked increase in adiposity as measured by fat mass ( ). Such increased adiposity was associated with increased food consumption ( ) that likely drove the increased adiposity. Emulsifier treatment also impaired glycemic control as assessed by fasting blood glucose concentration ( ) and glucose/insulin tolerance testing ( ).

Human exposure to dietary emulsifiers occurs in liquid and solid foods. Hence, we next examined whether incorporating emulsifiers into mouse chow would drive similar phenotypes. Supplementation of chow with 1.0% CMC or P80 fully mimicked the pro-inflammatory effects and metabolic changes induced by emulsifiers in drinking water ( ). While human emulsifier consumption is not a widely tracked parameter, their pervasive use in many foods exceed the 1.0% level (in food or water) used herein 6. Nonetheless, we next sought to better define the minimum doses of emulsifiers that would produce evidence of low-grade inflammation/metabolic syndrome. As little as 0.1% CMC resulted in modest increases in body weight and fasting glucose while 0.5% resulted in clear evidence of low-grade inflammation (shortened colon, enlarged spleen) and increased adiposity ( ). For P80, as little as 0.1% resulted in evidence of low-grade inflammation and increased adiposity, while 0.5% resulted in mild dysglycemia ( ). Emulsifier-induced metabolic syndrome was also observed in older mice ( ) and persisted for at least 6 weeks after stopping emulsifier consumption ( ). Promotion of metabolic syndrome was not seen upon exposure to sodium sulfite, which is a common food additive but not an emulsifier ( ). TLR5−/− mice are prone to developing metabolic syndrome 27, which results from poor microbiota management 18. Emulsifiers markedly promoted multiple parameters of metabolic syndrome in TLR5−/− mice ( ) including hyperphagia, increased adiposity, and glucose dysregulation, and was observed upon supplementation of chow or drinking water with as little as 0.1% P80 ( ). A trend toward development of metabolic syndrome in emulsifier-treated non-colitic IL10−/− mice was also observed, particularly evident upon exclusion of colitic mice, which exhibited weight loss ( ). Emulsifier-induced metabolic syndrome was observed in mice from multiple vivaria and strains, including Swiss-Webster, which, in contrast to C57BL/6 mice, are considered obesity-resistant 28 ( ).

Emulsifier-induced low grade inflammation and metabolic syndrome required the presence of a microbiota in that administration of emulsifiers to germ-free mice resulted in neither low-grade inflammation, as assessed by fecal Lcn-2, colon length and splenomegaly, nor all measured parameters of metabolic syndrome including body mass, fat mass, food intake and fasting glucose levels ( ). This result could reflect direct action of CMC and P80 on gut bacteria composition or metabolism. In accord with both of these possibilities, emulsifiers altered fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids ( ), including decreased levels of butyrate, which is thought to play a key role in dampening inflammation 29. Emulsifiers also altered bile acid levels ( , which influence microbiota composition 24. However, in germ free mice, emulsifiers did not alter bile acids, reduce mucus thickness, nor alter penetrance of 0.5 μm beads into the mucus ( ) suggesting these changes are not purely a direct effect of emulsifiers on mucus structures. Collectively, these data suggest alterations in mucus in emulsifier-treated mice might result, at least in part, from altered gut microbiota composition but do not exclude direct effects on the host.

Transfer of microbiota from emulsifier-treated mice to germ-free mice (not exposed to emulsifiers) transferred microbiota encroachment, low-grade inflammation ( ), increased adiposity, and dysglycemia ( ). Microbiota transplant from CMC-treated resulted in a more lasting increase in adiposity, paralleling that adiposity was less rapidly reversible following stoppage of CMC exposure ( ). Such transplanted phenotypes correlated with acquisition of elevated fecal LPS and flagellin ( ) and altered microbiota composition ( ). Thus, emulsifier-induced changes in microbiota play a role in driving the inflammation and metabolic changes promoted by these food additives.

The last half-century has witnessed a steady increase in consumption of food additives, many of which have not been carefully tested as they were given GRAS status at the time government entities charged with regulating food safety were created and/or expanded. Moreover, the testing of food additives that has been performed has generally utilized animal models designed to detect acute toxicity and/or promotion of cancer. Our data herein suggests that such testing may be inadequate - a notion supported by the recent observation that artificial sweeteners induce dysglycemia in humans 30. More specifically, our data suggests that one ubiquitous class of food additives, namely emulsifiers, can disturb the host-microbiota relationship resulting in a microbiota with enhanced mucolytic and pro-inflammatory activity that promotes intestinal inflammation. Such chronic gut inflammation can manifest as colitis or metabolic syndrome. While additional studies will be needed to determine if CMC, P80, and/or other emulsifiers impact human health, our observations in mice suggest the possibility that dietary emulsifiers may have contributed to the post-mid 20th century increased incidence of IBD, metabolic syndrome, and perhaps other chronic inflammatory diseases. Importantly, this hypothesis does not dispute the commonly held assumption that excess caloric consumption is a predominant factor driving the metabolic syndrome epidemic. Rather, it suggests such hyperphagia may be driven, in part, by food additives and other factors that might alter gut microbiota and promote low-grade intestinal inflammation.

METHODS

Mice

WT C57BL/6 and IL10−/− mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Swiss-Webster mice were purchased from Taconic, Inc. TLR5−/− were originally generated by Dr. Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Japan) 31 and backcrossed/maintained as previously described 27. All mice were then bred and housed at Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA under institutionally-approved protocols (IACUC # A14033). For WT mice, experiments were also performed on mice purchased directly from the above-mentioned providers and used within 3 days of receipt. Mice were fed Purina rodent chow # 5001, which is commonly used in many vivaria. Mice were weaned at 3 weeks of age and put into new cages (randomized to littermates) such that each experimental group contained mice from at least 2 different litters, and that each litter were used for at least 3 experimental groups. Experiments used either male or female mice (comparisons within a gender) except for figures 1M-P and 2 that utilized both male and female mice. For littermate control experiments (Fig. S7 and S8), all the mice from 10 (S7) and 8 (S8) different litters (from distinct mothers) were used and placed into cages such that each litter was split equally amongst groups that were to receive water, CMC or P80 (3 (S7) or 2 (S8) cages per sex per condition). For experiments using older mice (Fig. S13 and S14), mice were weaned at 3 weeks of age, put into new cages, and subjected to emulsifier treatment starting 3 months later.

Materials

Sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC, average M 250,000), Polysorbate-80 (P80) and Sodium Sulfite were purchased from Sigma (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).

Emulsifier agent treatment

Mice were exposed to CMC, P80 or sodium sulfite diluted in the drinking water (1.0% or indicated concentration) (not blinded). The same water (reverse-osmosis treated Atlanta city water) was used for the water-treated (control) group. These solutions were changed every week. Emulsifier solutions were autoclaved for experiments presented in figure 4A-H. When required, emulsifier solutions were replaced by water after 8 weeks of treatment for an additional 6 weeks. Body weights were measured every week and are expressed as % compare to the initial body weight (day 0) defined as 100%. Mice developing colitis (Lcn2 level ≥ 500 ng/g of feces) were excluded for metabolic syndrome parameters analysis. Fresh feces were collected every week for downstream analysis. After 3 months of emulsifier treatment, mice were fasted for 5-h at which time blood was collected by retrobulbar intraorbital capillary plexus. Hemolysis-free serum was generated by centrifugation of blood using serum separator tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Mice were then euthanized, and colon length, colon weight, spleen weight and adipose weight were measure. Organs were collected for downstream analysis. Incorporation of CMC and P80 in the diet was performed by Research Diets Inc. (New Brunswick, NJ, USA) using Purina Rodent Chow diet #5001. These diets are now referenced by Research Diets as C13050701 and C13050702, respectively.

Food intake measurement

Groups of mice were placed in a clean cage with a known amount of food. Twenty-four hours later, amount of remaining food was measured with the difference viewed as food intake per 24h. Error bars reflect S.E.M. of 3 measurements made one week apart.

Overnight fasting blood glucose measurement

Mice were placed in a clean cage and fasted for 15h. Blood glucose concentration was then determined using a Nova Max Plus Glucose Meter and expressed in mg/dL.

Glucose and insulin tolerance test

WT and TLR5−/− mice were treated with CMC or P80 diluted to 1% drinking water for 8 weeks. Followed a 5h fasting, baseline blood glucose levels were measured using a Nova Max Plus Glucose Meter and expressed in mg/dL. Mice were then injected intraperitoneally with 2 g glucose/kg body weight in sterile PBS or with 0.5 U insulin/kg body weight (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and blood glucose levels were measured 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after injection, as previously described 27.

In vivo epithelial barrier permeability

In vivo assay of intestinal barrier function was performed using an FITC-labeled dextran method, as previously described 32. Mice were deprived of food and water for 4 hours, and were then gavaged with 15mg of permeability tracer FITC–labeled dextran 4 kDa (FD4, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Blood was collected retro-orbitally after 3 hours, and fluorescence intensity was measured in the serum (excitation, 490 nm; emission, 520 nm; BIOTEK Fluorescence Spectrophotometer). FITC-dextran concentrations were determined using a standard curve generated by serial dilution of FITC-dextran in mice serum.

Germ-free experiments

Germ-free Swiss Webster mice were kept under germ-free conditions in a Park Bioservices isolator in our germ-free facility. CMC and P80 were diluted to 1% in water and then autoclaved for germ-free purpose. Same water was used for the water-treated (control) group. After 3 months of emulsifier agent treatment, mice were fasted for 5-h and then removed from isolator to be euthanized. Samples were collected as previously described. For the analysis of mucus layer integrity, germ-free C57BL/6 mice were kept under germ-free conditions and treated with CMC or P80 as described above. After 2 months of emulsifier agent treatment, mice were removed from isolator, and inoculated with 0.5 μm green fluorescent beads (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Seven hours post inoculation, mice were euthanized, colonic tissue were collected and placed in methanol-Carnoy's fixative solution, followed by immunostaining of mucins, as described below.

Microbiota transplantation

Cecal contents from detergent treated mice were suspended in 30% glycerol diluted in PBS (1.0 ml) and stocked at −80°C until analysis. Germ-free Swiss Webster mice (4 weeks old) were removed from isolator and were orally administered with 200μL of fecal suspension made using glycerol stocks. Transplanted mice were then monitored as previously described.

Colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay

Neutrophil influx in tissue was analyzed by assaying the enzymatic activity of MPO, a marker for neutrophils. Briefly, tissue (50 mg/mL) were thoroughly washed in PBS and homogenized in 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 50 mM PBS, (pH 6.0), freeze-thawed 3 times, sonicated and centrifuged. MPO was assayed in the clear supernatant by adding 1 mg/mL of dianisidine dihydrochloride (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 5×10−4% H2O2 and the change in optical density measured at 450 nm. Human neutrophil MPO (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used as standard. One unit of MPO activity was defined as the amount that degraded 1.0 μmol of peroxide/min at 25°C 33.

H&E staining and histopathologic analysis

Following euthanasia, mouse colons and small intestines were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours at room temperature and then embedded in paraffin. Tissues were sectioned at 5-μm thickness and stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) using standard protocols. H&E stained slides were scored as follows. Each colon was assigned four scores based on the degree of epithelial damage and inflammatory infiltrate in the mucosa, submucosa and muscularis/serosa, as previously described 34. A slight modification was made to this scoring system 23; each of the four scores was multiplied by 1 if the change was focal, 2 if it was patchy and 3 if it was diffuse. The 4 individual scores per colon were added, resulting in a total scoring range of 0–36 per mouse.

Periodic Acid Schiff Staining

Following euthanasia, mouse colons were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours at room temperature and then embedded in paraffin. Tissues were sectioned at 5-μm thickness, deparaffinized and oxidized for 5 minutes in 0.5% periodic acid solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After rinsing, tissues were placed in Schiff reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 15 minutes, washed in warm water, and counterstained using hematoxylin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for one minute.

Immunostaining of mucins and localization of bacteria by FISH

Mucus immunostaining was paired with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), as previously described 11, in order to analyze bacteria localization at the surface of the intestinal mucosa. Briefly, colonic tissues (proximal colon, 2nd cm from the cecum) containing fecal material were placed in methanol-Carnoy's fixative solution (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, 10% glacial acetic acid) for a minimum of 3 h at room temperature. Tissue were then washed in methanol 2 × 30 min, ethanol 2 × 15 min, ethanol/xylene (1:1) 15 min and xylene 2 × 15 min, followed by embedding in Paraffin with a vertical orientation. Five μm sections were performed and dewax by preheating at 60°C for 10 min, followed by xylene 60°C for 10 min, xylene for 10 min and 99.5% ethanol for 10 minutes. Hybridization step was performed at 50°C overnight with EUB338 probe (5’-GCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3’, with a 5' labeling using Alexa 647) diluted to a final concentration of 10 μg/mL in hybridization buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9 M NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 20% formamide). After washing 10 min in wash buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9 M NaCl) and 3 × 10 min in PBS, PAP pen (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used to mark around the section and block solution (5% fetal bovine serum in PBS) was added for 30 min at 4°C. Mucin-2 primary antibody (rabbit H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted 1:1500 in block solution and apply overnight at 4°C. After washing 3 × 10 min in PBS, block solution containing anti-rabbit Alexa 488 secondary antibody diluted 1:1500, Phalloidin-Tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 1μg/mL and Hoechst 33258 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 10μg/mL was applied to the section for 2h. After washing 3 × 10 min in PBS slides were mounted using Prolong anti-fade mounting media (Life Technologies). Observations were performed with a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope with software Zen 2011 version 7.1. This software was used to determine the distance between bacteria and epithelial cell monolayer, as well as the mucus thickness.

Quantification of fecal Lcn-2 by ELISA and determination of colitis incidence

For quantification of fecal Lcn-2 by ELISA, frozen fecal samples were reconstituted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 to a final concentration of 100 mg/mL and vortexed for 20 min to get a homogenous fecal suspension 23. These samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 14 000 g and 4°C. Clear supernatants were collected and stored at −20°C until analysis. Lcn-2 levels were estimated in the supernatants using Duoset murine Lcn-2 ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) using the colorimetric peroxidase substrate tetramethylbenzidine, and optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm (Versamax microplate reader). For determination of colitis incidence, a fecal Lcn2 level ≥ 500 ng/g of feces was use to determine colitic mice.

Fecal flagellin and lipopolysaccharide load quantification

We quantified flagellin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as previously described 21 using human embryonic kidney (HEK)-Blue-mTLR5 and HEK-BluemTLR4 cells, respectively (Invivogen, San Diego, California, USA). We resuspended fecal material in PBS to a final concentration of 100 mg/mL and homogenized for 10 s using a Mini-Beadbeater-24 without the addition of beads to avoid bacteria disruption. We then centrifuged the samples at 8000 g for 2 min and serially diluted the resulting supernatant and applied to mammalian cells. Purified E. coli flagellin and LPS (Sigma, St Louis, Missouri, USA) were used for standard curve determination using HEK-Blue-mTLR5 and HEK-Blue-mTLR4 cells, respectively. After 24 h of stimulation, we applied cell culture supernatant to QUANTI-Blue medium (Invivogen, San Diego, California, USA) and measured alkaline phosphatase activity at 620 nm after 30 min.

Serum flagellin and LPS-specific immunoglobulins

Flagellin- and LPS-specific IgA and IgG levels were quantified by ELISA, as previously reported 22,35. Microtiter plates were coated overnight with purified E. coli flagellin (100 ng/well) or LPS (1 μg/well). Serum samples diluted 1:500 were then applied. After incubation and washing, wells were incubated either with anti-mouse IgA or anti-mouse IgG. Quantification was performed using the colorimetric peroxidase substrate tetramethylbenzidine, as described above. Data are reported as OD corrected by subtracting background (determined by readings in samples lacking serum).

Gene expression analysis by q-RT-PCR

Total RNAs were isolated from colonic tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the iScriptTM One-Step RT-PCR Kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in a CFX96 apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with specific mouse oligonucleotides. The sense and antisense oligonucleotides used were, respectively, the following: 36B4 5’-TCCAGGCTTTGGGCATCA-3’ and 5’-CTTTATTCAGCTGCACATCACTCAGA-3’, Tff3 5’-CCTGGTTGCTGGGTCCTCTGG-3’ and 5’-GTCTCCTGCAGAGGTTTGAAGC-3’, Klf4F 5’-TGTGACTATGCAGGCTGTGG-3’ and 5’-AGTGCCTGGTCAGTTCATCG-3’. Results were normalized to the housekeeping 36B4 gene.

Bacterial quantification by q-PCR

For quantification of total fecal bacterial load, total bacterial DNA was isolated from weighted feces using QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen). DNA was then subjected to quantitative PCR using QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR kit (Biorad) with universal 16S rRNA primers 8F: 5’-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3’ and 338R: 5’-CTGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3’ to measure total bacteria 36. Results are expressed as bacteria number per mg of stool, using a standard curve. For quantification of mucosa-associated bacteria, total DNA was isolated from PBS-washed and weighted colonic tissue using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). DNA was then subjected to quantitative PCR as described above, and results are expressed as bacteria number per mg of colonic tissue, using a standard curve.

Fecal microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing using Illumina technology

16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing were done using the Illumina MiSeq technology following the protocol of Earth Microbiome Project with their modifications to the MOBIO PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit procedure for extracting DNA (www.earthmicrobiome.org/emp-standard-protocols) 37,38. Bulk DNA were extracted from frozen extruded feces using a PowerSoil-htp kit from MoBio Laboratories (Carlsbad, California, USA) with mechanical disruption (bead-beating). The 16S rRNA genes, region V4, were PCR amplified from each sample using a composite forward primer and a reverse primer containing a unique 12-base barcode, designed using the Golay error-correcting scheme, which was used to tag PCR products from respective samples 38. We used the forward primer 515F 5’-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC GTGTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGT AA-3’: the italicized sequence is the 5’ Illumina adapter B, the bold sequence is the primer pad, the italicized and bold sequence is the primer linker and the underlined sequence is the conserved bacterial primer 515F. The reverse primer 806R used was 5’-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT XXXXXXXXXXXX   CCGGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3’: the italicized sequence is the 3’ reverse complement sequence of Illumina adapter, the 12 X sequence is the golay barcode, the bold sequence is the primer pad, the italicized and bold sequence is the primer linker and the underlined sequence is the conserved bacterial primer 806R. PCR reactions consisted of Hot Master PCR mix (Five Prime), 0.2 μM of each primer, 10-100 ng template, and reaction conditions were 3 min at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 45 s at 95°C, 60s at 50°C and 90 s at 72°C on a Biorad thermocycler. Four independent PCRs were performed for each sample, combined, purified with Ampure magnetic purification beads (Agencourt), and products were visualized by gel electrophoresis. Products were then quantified (BIOTEK Fluorescence Spectrophotometer) using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay. A master DNA pool was generated from the purified products in equimolar ratios. The pooled products were quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay and then sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq sequencer (paired-end reads, 2 × 250 bp) at Cornell University, Ithaca.

16S rRNA gene sequence analysis

The sequences were demultiplexed, quality filtered using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME, version 1.8.0) software package 39, and forward and reverse Illumina reads were joined using the fastq-join method 40,41. We used QIIME default parameters for quality filtering (reads truncated at first low-quality base and excluded if: (1) there were more than three consecutive low quality base calls (2), less than 75% of read length was consecutive high quality base calls (3), at least one uncalled base was present (4), more than 1.5 errors were present in the bar code (5), any Phred qualities were below 20, or (6) the length was less than 75 bases). Sequences were assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using UCLUST algorithm 42 with a 97% threshold of pairwise identity (without the creation of new clusters with sequences that do not match the reference sequences), and classified taxonomically using the Greengenes reference database 43. A single representative sequence for each OTU was aligned and a phylogenetic tree was built using FastTree 44. The phylogenetic tree was used for computing the unweighted UniFrac distances between samples 12,45, rarefaction were performed (3,500 – 20,000 sequences per sample) and used to compare abundances of OTUs across samples. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots were used to assess the variation between experimental group (beta diversity) and Jackknifed beta diversity was used to estimate the uncertainty in PCoA plots. In addition to using PCoA, samples were clustered using UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean). Alpha diversity curves were determined for all samples using the determination of the number of observed species, and Shannon diversity index was used to characterize species diversity in a community. Our full 16S rRNA gene sequence data are deposited under Study ID XXXX and YYYY in the QIIME-DB database (http://www.microbio.me/qiime/).

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids composition analysis

Fecal samples were used to analyze SCFA and bile acid composition at Metabolomics Core of the University of Michigan (supported by grant U24 DK097153 of NIH Common Funds Project to the University of Michigan).

Statistical analysis

All replicates in this study were biological; i.e. repeat experiments with additional mice. D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus test was used to verify that all data were normally distributed. Significance was determined using t-test, one-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons with Sidak test, two-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni test, or two-way group ANOVA (GraphPad Prism software, version 6.01). Differences were noted as significant *p≤0.05. A ‘nearest-shrunken centroid’ classification approach was performed to detect the OTUs that were particularly representative of each experimental group 46. The amount of shrinkage was set to minimize the misclassification error. When OTUs were used to classify samples, accuracy of the classification was perfect (overall error rate=0). These analyses allowed the identification of the 15 OTUs whose abundances were the most significantly different between experimental groups, which were then used for heatmap generation and sample clustering. These analyses were performed using the Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM) package within R software 46.
