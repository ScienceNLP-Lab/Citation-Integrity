Regulation of energy metabolism by inflammation: A feedback response                         in obesity and calorie restriction

Abstract

                     Caloric                             restriction (CR), in the absence of malnutrition, delays aging and prevents                             aging-related diseases through multiple mechanisms. A reduction in chronic                             inflammation is widely observed in experimental models of caloric                             restriction. The low inflammation status may contribute to the reduced                             incidence of osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular diseases and                             cancer in the aging subjects. The association of caloric restriction with                             low inflammation suggests a role of energy accumulation in the origin of                             the chronic inflammation. This point is enforced by recent advances in                             obesity research. Abundant literature on obesity suggests that chronic                             inflammation is a consequence of energy accumulation in the body. The                             emerging evidence strongly supports that the inflammatory response induces                             energy expenditure in a feedback manner to fight against energy surplus in                             obesity.                      If                         this feedback system is deficient (Inflammation Resistance), energy                         expenditure will be reduced and energy accumulation will lead to obesity. In this perspective, we propose                             that an increase in inflammation in obesity promotes energy expenditure                             with a goal to get rid of energy surplus. A decrease in inflammation under                             caloric restriction contributes to energy saving. Inflammation is a                             mechanism for energy balance in the body. Inflammation resistance will lead                             to obesity. We will review the recent literature in support of the                             viewpoints.                 

Introduction

Caloric restriction (CR) reduces the                         levels of multiple aspects of inflammation [1-3], suggesting a link between                         energy status and inflammation. This linkage is enforced by recent progress in                         obesity research. Chronic inflammation is widely observed in obesity (metabolic                         syndrome). The obesity-associated inflammation is involved in pathogenesis of                         type 2 diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, fatty liver, cancer metastasis,                         and asthma in obesity. Obesity has a higher prevalence in the aging population                         as a result of reduced energy expenditure with less physical activity. Physical                         activities consume a major portion of energy in our daily life, which are                         usually reduced in the aging population. This reduction in energy expenditure                         may lead to energy accumulation in the body and consequently a gain in                         adiposity. In obesity, systemic chronic inflammation occurs with elevated proinflammatory                         cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, CRP, PAI-1,                    et al.) in the circulation. The systemic inflammation                         is due to an inflammatory response in adipose tissues that are under quick                         expansion. Adipocytes produce these cytokines. In addition, macrophage                         infiltration into the adipose tissue contributes significantly to the cytokine                         production. Although we have learned a lot about the signaling pathways that                         link energy accumulation (adiposity) to chronic inflammation, we know little                         about the real biological significance of the inflammation. This article                         addresses this issue, and provides an overview of the interaction of                         inflammation and energy balance.                                  

1.                             Chronic inflammation from energy accumulation                         

In                             obesity research, the link between chronic inflammation and energy (fat)                             accumulation is well established. The initial observation of TNF-α elevation in adipose tissue of obese mice provides                             the first evidence for the chronic inflammation in 1993 by Hotamisligil and                             colleagues [4]. Thereafter, the concept was enforced by abundant literature                             identifying increases in many other inflammatory cytokines, such as plasma                             C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), plasminogen activator                             inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), in models of obesity. Activation of inflammatory kinases                             such as IKKβ (IkBα kinase beta) and JNK1 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1)                             provides additional evidence for activation of intracellular inflammatory                             pathways in obesity [5-6]. Obesity-associated inflammation is chronic,                             systemic, low-grade, and not linked to any infection. In contrast to                             inflammation induced by bacteria or virus infection where neutrophil                             granulocytes are elevated in the circulation, neutrophil granulocytes are not                             increased in blood in obesity. The inflammation is systemic since the                             inflammatory cytokines are increased in the circulation. The inflammation is at                             a low grade in obesity since there is no fever and malaise, which are often                             observed for inflammation associated with bacteria/viral infection.                                          

2.                             Inflammation origin: Energy accumulation may induce inflammation through                             metabolites of fatty acids and glucose (Figure 1)                         

The                             metabolites of fatty acids and glucose include diaglyceride (DAG), Ceramide,                             and reactive oxygen species (Figure 1). They activate inflammatory response                             through several approaches. They may direct interact with signaling kinases                             (PKCs, JNKs and IKKs) in cells [7]. They may also act through cell membrane                             receptors for lipids, such as TLR4, CD36 or GPR [8-11]. The reactive oxygen                             species (ROS) are generated from fat or glucose oxidation in mitochondria. ROS                             may induce activation of the inflammatory kinases (JNK and IKK). The lipids                             also induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress for activation of JNK and IKK                             [12-13]. In CR, these metabolites of glucose and fatty acids are reduced from                             less calorie intake. The risk of inflammation is reduced.                                          

In obesity, adipose tissue is a major                             source of chronic inflammation [14-15]. In adipose tissue, adipocytes and                             adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) are the major cell types responsible for the                             production of inflammatory cytokines. The representative cytokines include TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1 and PAI-1. Adipokines (Leptin and adiponectin) are                             produced by adipocytes and also involved in the regulation of inflammation.                             Macro-phages and adipocytes are activated during the process of adipose tissue                             expansion. Recent studies suggest that the adipose tissue expansion induces a                             local hypoxia response [16]. The hypoxia response serves as a common root for                             all of the stress responses in adipose tissue, such as oxidative stress, ER                             stress, and inflammatory stress [17-19]. Hypoxia directly promotes the chronic                             inflammation through activation of transcription factors (NF-kB and HIF-1) in                             adipocytes and macrophages [16]. The hypoxia response is a result of tissue                             expansion. In CR, adipose tissue expansion is reduced or under controlled. The                             risk factors for inflammation, such as adipose tissue hypoxia, lipid                             accumulation, ER stress and oxidative stress are all reduced or absent. These                             may explain why CR reduces the risk for chronic inflammation in the body.                                          

3.                             Inflammation feedback to energy accumulation                         

The                             inflammation observed in adipose tissue likely serves as a feedback signal                             locally in adipose tissue and systemically for energy expenditure (Figure 2).                             In adipose tissue, inflammation inhibits adipocyte expansion and adipocyte                             differentiation, changes adipocyte endocrine and induces extracellular matrix                             remodeling [20]. The local response is translated into a systemic response                             through cytokines and free acids released from adipose tissue.                                          

(a) Adipocyte                             inhibition. A major function of adipocytes is to store fat. In addition, the                             adipocytes secrete many cytokines/hormones in its endocrine activity. Inflammatory                             cytokines inhibit adipocyte function in multiple aspects. These include                             inhibition of preadipocyte differentiation, induction of lipolysis and                             suppression of adiponectin expression in mature adipocytes. These inhibitory                             activities are well documented for TNF-α and IL-1 [21-23]. At the molecular level, inflammation                             inhibits insulin signaling pathway [24-26] and PPARγ activities in adipocytes [27].                             These effects contribute to suppression of tissue expansion, and alteration in                             cytokine profile. The disorders in lipid metabolism and cytokine balance                             contribute to the whole body insulin resistance, a result of impaired insulin                             signaling in multiple organs (skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue)                             [28-30]. Insulin resistance may induce hyperglycemia, which in turn leads to                             glucose excretion through urine (type 2 diabetes). The type 2 diabetes is an                             extreme condition in the body to get ride of energy surplus in an effort to                             prevent energy accumulation in the body.                                          

(b) Adipose tissue remodeling: Macrophage infiltration                             is a major marker of local inflammation in the adipose tissue in obesity.                             Adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) have been under active investigation since                             2004 when macrophage infiltration was initially identified in obese mice                             [31-34]. The discovery provides a source for TNF-α                             in adipose tissue since mature adipocytes produces very little TNF-α [31-34]. The biological significance of macrophage                             infiltration remains to be elucidated. However, more and more evidence suggests                             that macrophages are required for adipose tissue remodeling and adipogenesis of                             preadipocytes. Macrophages may serve as a signal amplifier in the adipose                             tissue for stimulation of angiogenesis [35]. Macrophages produce many                             angiogenic factors, such as PDGF, TGF-β and HGF, which are                             increased in adipose tissue in obese individuals [36-37]. Interestingly, this                             activity of macrophages is required for adipose tissue growth in lean mice                             [38-39] and obese mice [35]. Macrophages may also regulate blood flow through                             production of vasodilators (such as NO). Macrophages may clean the cell debris                             of dead adipocytes within the adipose tissue [40]. An increase in adipocyte                             death was reported in the adipose tissue of obese mice, and the dead cells were                             surrounded by ATMs to form the "Crown" like structure [40-41]. The cell death                             in adipose tissue may be a result of the hypoxia response [42]. In CR, the                             adipose tissue expansion is under control, there are not such risk factors for                             macrophage activation in adipose tissue.                                          

(c) Fuel mobilization. Inflammation regulates fuel                             mobilization. Fuel (fatty acids) mobilization from adipose tissue to other                             tissues is controlled by the nervous system and hormones/cytokines. The role of                             inflammatory cytokines has drawn a lot of attention in the fuel mobilization.                             Cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, et al., activate fuel efflux in                             adipocytes through lipolysis, in which free fatty acids (FFAs) are generated                             from triglycerides under hydrolysis and released into blood stream. FFAs are                             normally oxidized in mitochondria for ATP production. An increase in FFA supply                             may lead to acceleration of energy expenditure. However, when FFA supply                             overrides the consumption, they deposit in non-adipocytes in the form of                             ectopic fat deposition. The ectopic fat contributes to pathogenesis of fatty                             liver disease and atherosclosis (deposit on the blood vessel wall). In the                             physiological conditions, IL-6 secreted by contracting muscle is involved in                             coordination of fuel mobilization between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle                             during exercise [43-44]. In CR, the fatty acid supply is limited as a result of                             reduced calorie intake, the risk for ectopic fat deposition will be reduced.                             This may help in prevention of fatty liver and atherosclosis.                                          

(d) Energy intake. Inflammatory cytokines are involved                             in the regulation of energy intake and expenditure. IL-1 and IL-6 reduces food                             intake and prevent hyperphagia [45-46]. Cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α)                             also induce energy expenditure [46-50]. These activities of cytokines are                             dependent on their actions in the central nervous system [46-47,51-52].                             Therefore, inflammatory cytokines may serve as an anti-obesity signal by                             modifying both energy intake and energy expenditure. Additionally, these data                             indicate that the inflammatory cytokines may serve as a link between peripheral                             tissues and central nervous system in the control of energy balance.                                          

4. Energy expenditure by inflammation                         

The activities of inflammatory cytokines                             on adipocytes and neurons suggest that inflammation may inhibit energy                             accumulation. They induce energy expenditure and inhibits food intake. These                             possibilities are strongly supported by phenotypes of transgenic mice with                             chronic inflammation and by cytokine infusion studies. Transgenic mice of                             IKK2/NF-kB have provided new evidence.                                          

The                             IKK2/NF-kB pathway is a dominant inflammation signaling pathway. The pathway                             has been under active investigation in the obesity field after IKKβ was                             found to induce insulin resistance in obese mice [5]. The serine kinase IKK has                             three major isoforms including IKKα (IKK1), IKKβ (IKK2) and                             IKKγ, in which IKKβ is required for NF-kB activation [53]. In obesity,                             IKKβ is activated by several intracellular signals, such as ROS, ER                             stress, DAG, and Ceramide. IKKβ is also activated by the extracellular                             stimuli including TNF-α, IL-1, and fatty acids [8], and hypoxia [54].                             IKKβ induces NF-kB activation by phosphorylation of the Inhibitor Kappa B                             alpha (IkBα) [55].                                          

NF-kB                             (nuclear factor kappa B) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is formed by                             two subunits of Rel family, which include seven members, p65 (RelA), p50                             (NF-kB1), c-Rel, RelB, p100, p105, p52 [56]. These members form a homodimer or                             heterodimer in the regulation of gene transcription. In most case, NF-kB is a                             heterodimer of p65 and p50. P65 contains the transactivation domain and                             mediates the transcriptional activity of NF-kB. P50 usually inhibits the                             transcriptional activity of p65 [57], and the inhibition disappears in the                             NF-kB p50 knockout mice [58]. In the classical pathway, NF-kB activation is                             mediated by IKKβ-induced phosphorylation, proteasome-mediated degradation                             of IkBα [53]. In response to stress responses, NF-kB promotes                             lipid mobilization through suppression of PPARγ activity in                             the nucleus [59]. It also induces transcription of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α,                             IL-1, IL-6, MCP-1, et al.). In the alternative pathway, NF-kB is activated by                             hypoxia in the absence of IkBα degradation. This type of NF-kB                             activation in adipocytes and macrophages contributes to chronic inflammation in                             the adipose tissue of obese individuals [16].                                          

NF-kB                             activity may promote energy expenditure. This activity of NF-kB is supported by                             documents on energy expenditure in cachexia [60-61] and infection. However, the                             role of NF-kB in energy expenditure was not tested in transgenic models. To                             this point, we investigated energy metabolism in transgenic mice with elevated                             NF-kB activities. The transcriptional activity of NF-kB is enhanced either by                             over-expression of NF-kB p65 (RelA) in the fat tissue, or inactivation of NF-kB                             p50 (NF-kB1) by global gene knockout [65]. In these two models, inflammatory                             cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) were elevated in blood and energy expenditure                             was increased in day and night [65]. The oxygen consumption and CO2 production                             were both increased in the mice. Locomotion                             was not altered, but food intake was increased in the mice. Expression of                             inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) was elevated in adipose tissue and                             macrophages. On a high fat diet (HFD), both lines of transgenic mice were                             protected from obesity and insulin resistance [65-66]. The data suggests that                             the transcription factor NF-kB promotes energy expenditure and inhibits energy                             accumulation. The inflammatory cytokines may mediate the NF-kB activity in                             energy expenditure. In the mice, lipid accumulation is prevented by the                             enhanced energy expenditure. The studies suggest that inflammation may prevent                             insulin resistance by eliminating lipid accumulation. IKKβ was investigated in the control                             of insulin sensitivity [5,62-63] and food intake in transgenic mice [64].                             However, IKKβ was not                             investigated in the control of energy expenditure in these studies.                                          

NF-kB                             may promote energy expenditure through the inflammatory cytokines. In the two                             transgenic models, systemic inflammation was observed with elevated proteins                             for TNF-α and IL-6 in the serum [65-66]. Expression of TNF-α and IL-1                             mRNA was increased in adipose tissue and macrophages. These cytokines are                             positively associated with energy expenditure in the body [61]. In transgenic                             mice with deficiency in these cytokines or their receptors, energy accumulation                             is enhanced, suggesting a reduction in energy expenditure. This positive energy                             balance was reported in transgenic mice with deficiency in TNF-α [50],                             IL-1 [45] or IL-6 [46]. On the other side, when these cytokine activities are                             enhanced in transgenic mice, energy accumulation is decreased leading to a lean                             phenotype [48-49,67-68]. The cytokines may act in the hypothalamus of central                             nervous system to regulate the energy balance [46-47,51-52]. In addition to                             the central mechanism, activation of mitochondria by the cytokines in the                             peripheral tissues may also contribute to the energy expenditure. TNF-α                             and IL-1 enhances mitochondrial function through phosphorylation-mediated                             activation of PGC-1α [69]. This activity of inflammatory cytokines may                             contribute to energy consumption in mitochondria-enriched tissues/organs such                             as liver, skeletal muscle and brown fat. Inflammation may be a drug target in                             the management of energy metabolism [70-71].                                          

5.                             CR and chronic inflammation                         

Studies have demonstrated that CR                             decreases the circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory                             signaling activities in a wide variety of tissues [1-3]. CR is able to decrease                             global levels of inflammatory responses in the body. Interestingly, the                             beneficial effects of CR may be related to a decrease in visceral fat and                             adipose reactivity [3,72]. It has been documented that adiposity during aging                             contributes to a number of morbidity factors including insulin resistance,                             dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, hypercoagula-bility and hypertension [73-74]. However,                             it is important to remember that the most inflammation data are derived from                             the visceral fat and ectopic fat [72-74].  For example, subcutaneous fat has                             been observed to have beneficial effects on lipid and energy homeostasis, and                             even counteract the negative effects of visceral adipose tissue [75].  It is                             important to note that CR has beneficial effects in non-obese humans as well as                             non-obese rodents [76-77], indicating that decreased adiposity may not be the                             only mediator of beneficial effects of CR. This fact suggests that a decrease                             in energy accumulation is more important in the control of inflammation since                             this may apply to both obese and non-obese conditions.                                             

Summary

Energy                         accumulation induces chronic inflammation. This view is supported by data from                         many model systems of CR and obesity. Inflammation may promote energy                         expenditure in a regulatory-feedback manner to fight against energy surplus                         (Figure 2). This concept extends our understanding of biological significance                         of inflammation in obesity. It also helps us to understand why CR reduces                         inflammation. The inflammation may act in the peripheral organs/tissues as well                         as in the central nervous system to regulate energy balance. In the peripheral,                         inflammation induces fat mobilization and oxidation to promote energy                         expenditure. Inflammation may induce energy disposal through glucose excretion                         in urine as a result of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. In the central,                         inflammation may inhibit food intake and activate neurons for energy                         expenditure. If this feedback system is deficient, energy expenditure will be                         interrupted and fat will be accumulated in the body for adiposity. We call this condition of "Inflammation Resistance". In CR,                         the energy accumulation is prevented. In turn, the risk factors for the chronic                         inflammation are limited. In our view, the low inflammation serves as a                         mechanism for energy saving in CR.                                  

Figure 1.

 Energy accumulation leads to elevation                                                 in glucose and fatty acids. These substrates lead to production of                                                 diaglycerids (DAG), Ceramide, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation                                                 of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in cells including macrophages and endothelial                                                 cells. All of these events may activate the inflammatory signaling                                                 pathways, such as IKK/NF-kB and JNK/AP-1. As a consequence, expression of                                                 inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules may increase for chronic                                                 local inflammation. When inflammatory cytokines are elevated in the                                                 circulation, the energy accumulation causes systemic chronic inflammation,                                                 which is observed in obesity. This kind of chronic inflammation is limited                                                 or prevented by calorie restriction                                                                  

Figure 2.

 Rapid growth of                                                 adipose tissue leads to quick expansion of adipose tissue. When                                                 angiogenesis or vessel dilation can not meet the demand for blood supply,                                                 there will be an adipose tissue hypoxia (ATH) from lack of blood supply.                                                 ATH will induce angiogenesis and trigger inflammation. Inflammation will                                                 promote angiogenesis and vasodilation locally in the tissue for                                                 extracellular remodeling. When inflammatory cytokines and fatty acids are                                                 elevated in the circulation, they will promote energy expenditure                                                 systemically. The inflammatory response may also induce hyperglycemia and                                                 energy disposal through glucose excretion in urine. In this way,                                                 inflammation acts through insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.
