Dauer-independent insulin/IGF-1-signalling implicates collagen remodelling in longevity
Summary

Interventions that delay ageing mobilize mechanisms that protect and repair cellular components1–3, but it is unknown how these interventions might slow the functional decline of extracellular matrices4,5, which are also damaged during ageing6,7. Reduced Insulin/IGF-1 signalling (rIIS) extends lifespan across the evolutionary spectrum, and in juvenile C. elegans also allows the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO to induce development into dauer, a diapause that withstands harsh conditions (Supplementary Discussion)1,2. It has been suggested that rIIS delays C. elegans ageing through activation of dauer-related processes during adulthood2,8,9, but some rIIS conditions confer robust lifespan extension unaccompanied by any dauer-like traits1,10,11. Here we show that rIIS can promote C. elegans longevity through an program that is genetically distinct from the dauer pathway, and requires the Nrf (NF-E2-related factor) ortholog SKN-1 acting in parallel to DAF-16. SKN-1 is inhibited by IIS and has been broadly implicated in longevity12–14, but is rendered dispensable for rIIS lifespan extension by even mild activity of dauer-related processes. When IIS is decreased under conditions that do not induce dauer traits, SKN-1 most prominently increases expression of collagens and other extracellular matrix (ECM) genes. Diverse genetic, nutritional, and pharmacological pro-longevity interventions delay an age-related decline in collagen expression. These collagens mediate adulthood ECM remodelling, and are needed for ageing to be delayed by interventions that do not involve dauer traits. By genetically delineating a dauer-independent rIIS ageing pathway, our results show that IIS controls a broad set of protective mechanisms during C. elegans adulthood, and may facilitate elucidation of processes of general importance for longevity. The importance of collagen production in diverse anti-ageing interventions implies that ECM remodelling is a generally essential signature of longevity assurance, and that agents promoting ECM youthfulness may have systemic benefit.

Results and Discussion

We hypothesized that SKN-1 would be required for rIIS lifespan extension under conditions in which dauer-associated processes are inactive. Class 2 mutations in the insulin/IGF-1 receptor DAF-2 induce adulthood dauer-related traits that are mild at 20°C, and severe at 22.5°C or above, but Class 1 mutations do not (Video 1, 2; Supplementary Discussion)10. SKN-1 is inhibited by IIS phosphorylation but is dispensable for dauer development13, adulthood dauer-related traits (Extended Data Fig. 1a–d; Supplementary Table 1), or lifespan extension by Class 2 daf-2 mutations at 20°C (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 2)13. By contrast, at 15°C SKN-1 was completely required for longevity in the same Class 2 daf-2 mutants (Fig. 1a; Extended Data Fig. 1a, 1e, Extended Data Table 1, and Supplementary Table 2), which do not show dauer traits at 15°C10 because low temperature inhibits dauer entry (Supplementary Discussion). skn-1 was also essential at 20°C in Class 2 daf-2; daf-16 double mutants that expressed DAF-16 specifically in the intestine, a condition that rescues longevity but not dauer development1,15 or traits (Extended Data Fig. 1f, 1g and Table 1). Finally, skn-1 was required at 15°C, 20°C, or 25°C for lifespan extension from daf-2 RNA interference (RNAi) (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1a and Table 1, and Supplementary Table 2), which promotes dauer entry only at extreme temperature and does not induce dauer traits in adults (Extended Data Fig. 1h–j). In these last two scenarios, the absence of dauer traits may reflect DAF-16 insufficiency in neurons, which are central to dauer regulation15,16 and resistant to RNAi (Extended Data Fig. 1h, 1i, and Table 1). Lifespan extension is extremely robust when daf-2 RNAi is performed in the Class 1 mutant daf-2(e1368)11, which lacks adulthood dauer traits but predisposes to dauer entry10. skn-1 was largely required for this lifespan extension at 20°C, and was essential for the even greater healthy lifespan extension seen at 15°C (117 days maximum; Fig.1c, 1d; Extended Data Fig. 1a and Table 1).

The skn-1-dependence of rIIS longevity tracked inversely with predisposition to dauer entry or adulthood dauer traits, and was not determined by temperature (Extended Data Fig. 1a). skn-1-dependence also did not correlate with the magnitude of rIIS lifespan extension, suggesting that it was not determined by the extent of IIS reduction (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Accordingly, DAF-16 and SKN-1 nuclear localization was increased as robustly by daf-2 RNAi as by Class 1 or Class 2 daf-2 mutations, and was similar in daf-2 mutants at 15°C and 20°C (Extended Data Fig. 1k–o). Activation of dauer processes in adults by a mechanism other than genetic IIS reduction should extend lifespan without skn-1. Accordingly, skn-1 was dispensable for lifespan extension from adulthood dauer pheromone exposure (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 1p, 1q and Table 1).

We conclude that skn-1 is needed for rIIS longevity specifically when dauer-associated mechanisms are inactive (Extended Data Fig. 1a). This genetic requirement for skn-1 reveals that rIIS extends lifespan through two downstream pathways that may overlap (Fig. 1f). During the reproductive life cycle, IIS inhibits a protective program that requires both DAF-16 and SKN-1, and does not involve dauer-specific processes. This program may be controlled mainly by IIS acting outside the nervous system. The requirement for SKN-1 for lifespan extension is relieved under conditions that activate vestiges of the dauer developmental pathway in adults.

Analyses of how rIIS affects ageing have typically involved conditions that predispose to mild or even severe dauer-related traits (Supplementary Discussion), and would therefore allow skn-1-independent lifespan extension. We investigated the basis for dauer-independent rIIS longevity by identifying genes that are regulated by SKN-1 in daf-2 mutants at 15°C. At a false discovery rate of <3%, microarrays identified 429 genes with higher expression in daf-2(−) than daf-2(−); skn-1(−) animals (SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) genes), and 477 SKN-1-downregulated daf-2(−) genes, including direct and indirect SKN-1 targets (Extended Data Fig. 2a–e; Supplementary Table 3). Many of these genes affected lifespan as would be predicted by these expression patterns (Extended Data Fig. 2f–h; Supplementary Table 4, 5). Overlap with a dauer-expressed gene set was insignificant, as was overlap between SKN-1- and DAF-16-downregulated daf-2(−) genes (Extended Data Fig. 2i–k). However, many SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) genes were activated by DAF-16 (Extended Data Fig. 2j, 2l-t), which is also required for daf-2 lifespan extension at 15°C17, indicating that SKN-1 responds to rIIS by functioning in parallel to and independently of DAF-16.

SKN-1 has conserved functions in stress defence, protein homeostasis, and metabolism12,18,19 and was required for daf-2 oxidative stress resistance (Supplementary Table 6)13, but only 40/429 SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) genes had been identified under normal or stress conditions (Extended Data Fig. 3a–g; Supplementary Table 7)18. Unexpectedly, by far the most overrepresented functional group within the SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) gene set consisted of collagen genes, which seemed to be regulated by SKN-1 indirectly (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 3, 8, and 9). In humans, collagens constitute about 1/3 of all protein and accumulate damage during ageing, leading to functional decline in tissues throughout the body6,7. C. elegans collagens form basement membranes as well as the cuticle, a complex structure that covers the animal, lines the buccal cavity, pharynx, and rectum, and becomes thickened and wrinkled with age20. The SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) collagens are of the type that forms the cuticle, but are expressed in multiple tissues (Extended Data Fig. 3h; Supplementary Table 9). Collagen production decreases in human skin during ageing21, and 27 SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) collagens are among a set of genes that decline in expression as C. elegans ages22 (Supplementary Table 10). These and other collagens were prominently upregulated in each of 20 C. elegans longevity-associated gene sets we examined (Extended Data Table 2; Supplementary Table 10). Moreover, in mice extracellular matrix genes were overrepresented in some longevity or Nrf2-dependent sets (Supplementary tables 11, 12), and in silico analysis of longevity-associated genes identified a predicted ECM network23. The possible significance of these expression signatures has not been explored.

We investigated the functional importance of specific SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) collagen genes that decline during aging, and are upregulated in other longevity-associated gene sets (Extended Data Table 2). SKN-1 increased expression of these genes during adulthood, and delayed their age-related decline in expression in response to multiple interventions that promote longevity: daf-2 RNAi, rapamycin (mTOR kinase inhibitor24), the dietary restriction (DR) model eat-2, and inhibition of germ cell proliferation (glp-1(−))1 (Fig. 2b–g; Extended Data Fig. 3i–k, 4a, 4b). Adulthood knockdown of these collagen genes did not affect wild type lifespan, but dramatically reduced longevity of the canonical daf-2 Class 2 mutant e1370 at 15°C but not 20°C (Fig. 3a, 3b; Extended Data Fig. 4c and Table 3; Supplementary Table 13), at which skn-1 is dispensable for longevity (see above). Additionally, knockdown of these collagens significantly reduced lifespan extension from daf-2 RNAi at 20°C, and from other skn-1-dependent14,24,25 longevity interventions (Fig. 3c–e; Extended Data Fig. 4d and Table 3; Supplementary Table 13). Most of these genes include regions related to other collagens, but col-120 is unique (Supplementary Table 14), and at 15°C, daf-2(e1370) but not wild-type lifespan was reduced by the collagen mutation dpy-1(e1) (Extended Data Fig. 4e, Supplementary Table 13). Lack of a single critical collagen can therefore impair lifespan extension. At 15°C, daf-2(e1370) lifespan was also decreased by adulthood knockdown of certain extracellular protease genes from the SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) set, or other genes important for cuticle formation (Extended Data Fig. 4f, 13, 15). Remarkably, transgenic overexpression of key collagens from the SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) gene set but not other collagens modestly but consistently increased lifespan (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Table 13). Adulthood SKN-1-dependent expression of particular collagen and ECM genes therefore promotes lifespan extension in diverse pathways that slow C. elegans ageing.

Adulthood collagen RNAi did not affect body size, detectably impair cuticle function, or increase markers of various stresses (Extended Data Fig. 5a–v, 6a–i). Collagen RNAi sensitized to exogenous oxidative stress, however, and increased the prominence of ageing markers in daf-2 mutants at 15°C, and in rapamycin-treated animals (Fig. 4a, 4b, Extended Data Fig. 6j–m; Supplementary Table 16). Apparently, knockdown of these collagens interfered with the capacity of these interventions to delay ageing.

ECM gene upregulation might allow ECM remodelling to occur in adults. During ageing the collagens LON-3 and ROL-6 decline in expression22 and largely disappear from the cuticle (Fig. 4c; Extended Data Fig. 4a and 7a), indicating that C. elegans ECM proteins turn over. Adulthood daf-2 RNAi and other anti-ageing interventions increased total collagen in older C. elegans (Fig. 4d), indicating deposition of new ECM. This also occurred in daf-2(e1370) (Class 2) at 20°C, even though by adulthood day 8 expression of SKN-1 upregulated daf-2(−) collagens was not generally maintained in older daf-2(e1370) adults under these conditions (Fig. 4d; Extended Data Fig. 7b, 7c). Perhaps different genes might promote ECM remodelling under dauer-predisposed conditions, consistent with dauers having a distinct cuticle structure (Supplementary Discussion).

Longevity interventions delay ageing by acting through non cell-autonomous signalling pathways1. Adulthood col-120 knockdown reduced total daf-2 collagen levels (Fig. 4e), implying that individual collagens and the ECM influence these pathways. Adulthood collagen RNAi also inhibited SKN-1-responsive gene expression in adults that would otherwise be long-lived (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 7d–g), possibly explaining the importance of these collagens for oxidative stress resistance. These longevity interventions therefore require adulthood expression of particular ECM genes in order to maintain their beneficial regulatory program. Why would diverse longevity interventions induce and depend upon ECM remodelling? Under conditions of low nutrient availability, it might be advantageous to allocate resources towards ECM maintenance. The ECM also may directly affect signalling that orchestrates these longevity pathways, consistent with studies in other systems that identified signalling functions of collagens, and critical effects of the ECM on signalling pathways26–28.

We determined that in adult animals rIIS can activate a longevity program that is distinguished from the dauer developmental pathway by its lack of dauer-like traits, and its dependence upon skn-1 and SKN-1-dependent collagens (Fig. 1f). Further analyses will determine which rIIS longevity mechanisms are linked to the dauer program, and which are dauer-independent and possibly more broadly involved in pathways that promote longevity. Considerable effort has been devoted to enhancing collagen function in order to maintain youthful human skin during ageing29. By demonstrating that increased collagen expression is a shared feature of multiple conserved longevity pathways, our results suggest strategies for promoting ECM function that may be widely applicable. The long-lived naked mole rat is remarkably cancer resistant at least in part because it produces a uniquely dense hyaluronan, an ECM component30. Our results suggest that functional enhancement of the ECM may be generally important for longevity assurance per se. We speculate that interventions that promote collagen and ECM function systemically are likely to be beneficial in human chronic disease and ageing.

Methods

Strains

Caenorhabditis elegans strains were maintained on NGM plates and OP50 Escherichia coli bacteria at 20°C as described (Brenner, 1974)31, except that daf-2 mutants (and corresponding controls for a given assay) were maintained at 15°C unless otherwise noted. The wild-type strain was N2 Bristol31. Mutant strains used are described in Wormbase (www.wormbase.org): LGI: daf-16(mgDf47, mu86); LGII: eat-2(ad1116); LGIII: daf-2(e1368, e1370, and m596), rrf-3(pk1462), glp-1(bn18); and LGIV: eri-1(mg366), skn-1(tm3411, zu67, zu129, and zu135).

Construction of transgenic lines

To construct the collagen overexpression transgenes, the genomic region of each gene, including approximately 3 kb of promoter, the coding region, and 3’UTR sequences that encompass at least 2 predicted cleavage/polyadenylation sites, were amplified by PCR. These PCR products were injected at 50 ng/µl together with 100 ng/µl of pRF4 rol-6(su1006gf) into wild-type (N2) animals. For the triple collagen gene transgenic line (ldEx111), 50 ng/µl each of PCR products for col-10, col-13, col-120 were injected together with 50 ng/µl of pRF4 rol-6(su1006gf). For the control line (ldEx102), pBluescript KS(+) 50 ng/µl was injected along with 100 ng/µl of pRF4 rol-6(su1006gf)). Lines were isolated from at least 2 independent transgenic P0 animals. For col-10, a 4.4 kb genomic region was amplified using the primers 5’-CCACCAACAACTCCATCCACC-3’ and 5’- GTAAAGTGGGCAGGCCGTAG-3’. The resulting transgenic lines were ldEx103 and ldEx104. For col-13, a 4.3 kb genomic region was amplified using the primers 5’-TAGCCCAAGTCTGACCGAAG-3’ and 5’- CGGATCTTCCCAACCAGGAG-3’. The resulting transgenic lines were ldEx105, ldEx106, ldEx107, and ldEx108. For col-120, a 4.4 kb genomic region was amplified using the primers 5’-CAATATGACCCGAGGCGCTG-3’ and 5’-CGCCAGAATCGTAAGGCTCC-3’. The resulting transgenic lines were: ldEx109 and ldEx110. Transgene overexpression levels were determined by qRT-PCR of one-day old adults.

Scoring of phenotypic experiments

No statistical methods were used in choosing sample sizes. In analyses of fluorescent reporters, either all or representative trials were scored blindly. All other phenotypic assays were not scored blindly.

Body length measurements

Animals were maintained at 15°C and either kept at 15°C, or shifted to 25°C at the first day of adulthood. At day 3 of adulthood, animals were mounted on 2% agar pads, immobilized with 0.06% tetramisole and images were taken at 10x magnification with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope and with a Zeiss AxioCam HRc digital camera. Body lengths were measured by placing a line through the middle of the body starting from head to tail using Zeiss AxioVision V 4.8.2.0 program (Extended Data Fig. 1d).

Lifespan assays

Strains were age-synchronized by picking L4 animals onto fresh OP50 plates, then day-one adults were placed on either OP50 or RNAi plates containing 50 µM 5-Fluoro-2’deoxyuridine (FUdR), unless otherwise indicated, and assayed either at 15°C, 20°C, or 25°C as described in14. All lifespans were plotted with L4 as time-point=0. For glp-1(bn18) lifespans, wild type (N2) and glp-1(bn18) were maintained at 15°C, then shifted to 25°C at the mid-L1 stage as described in45. At the first day of adulthood they were placed on plates containing FUdR and RNAi bacteria for lifespan assay at 20°C (Fig. 4g; Extended Data Table 3). For rapamycin lifespans, one-day old animals were placed on plates containing FUdR, RNAi bacteria, and either rapamycin (100µM) dissolved in 0.2% DMSO or 0.2% DMSO control as described in14. Lifespan was determined at 20°C (Fig. 3d; Extended Data Table 3; Supplementary Table 13). For dauer pheromone experiments, day-one adults were placed on plates containing FUdR, RNAi bacteria, and either crude dauer pheromone (a gift from Piali Sengupta) dissolved in 6% ethanol, or 6% ethanol control as described in46. Those lifespans were determined at 25°C (Fig. 1e; Extended Data Table 1; Supplementary Table 2). Animals were classified as dead animals if they failed to respond to prodding. Exploded or bagged animals were excluded from the statistics. The estimates of survival functions were calculated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method. The log-rank (Mantel-Cox) method was used to test the null hypothesis and calculate P values (JMP software v.9.0.2.).

Scoring of transgenic protein nuclear accumulation or expression

Nuclear accumulation of SKN-1 that was expressed from the SKN-1bc::GFP transgene (LD001 strain), which encodes two of the three SKN-1 isoforms, was scored blindly after mounting on slides essentially as in14 (Extended Data Fig. 1k–n). none = no GFP observed in nuclei; low = some nuclei show GFP; medium = more than half of the nuclei show GFP; high = all intestinal nuclei show GFP. Nuclear accumulation of DAF-16a/b::GFP (zIs356) was scored as described in47 (Extended Data Fig. 1n). Nuclear accumulation of DAF-16f::GFP (lpIs14) was scored as none = no GFP observed in nuclei; medium = more than half of the nuclei show GFP; high = all intestinal nuclei show GFP (Extended Data Fig. 1o). For Pcol-12::dsRED, Pcol-144::GFP, Pgst-4::GFP, and Phsp-4::GFP: one-day adult animals were placed on RNAi and three and/or seven days later the green or red fluorescence intensity was scored by using a Zeiss AxioSKOP2 microscope. Green or red fluorescence was categorized in none/very low, low, medium, or high intensity and was scored blindly (Fig. 4f,Extended Data Fig. 3j–k, 6h–j, 7d–g).

RNA interference

RNAi clones were picked from the Ahringer48 or Vidal49 libraries. Cultures were grown overnight in LB with 12.5 µg/ml tetracycline and 100 µg/ml ampicillin, diluted to an OD600 of 1, and induced with 1 mM IPTG. This culture was seeded onto NGM agar plates containing tetracycline, ampicillin, and additional IPTG. Empty vector (EV) plasmid pL4440 was used as control. For double RNAi, clones were grown separately in parallel and after spin-down equal amounts of two clones were mixed and spread on plates.

RNA isolation for microarray analysis

After a timed egg-lay on HT115 E. coli, daf-2(e1368) and daf-2(e1368);skn-1(zu67) or daf-2(e1370) and daf-2(e1370);skn-1(zu67) worms were grown at 15°C until the late L4 stage. Approximately 200 worms were collected and washed three times in M9 buffer31 to remove bacteria. TriReagent (Sigma) was added, and samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated using TriReagent and an RNA purification column (RNAeasy, Qiagen). RNA quality was determined by visualization of 28S and 18S rRNA bands on a denaturing formaldehyde gel, or an RNAse-free 1.5–2% agarose TBE gel.

RNA preparation, hybridization and data collection for microarray experiments

RNA (325 ng) was linearly amplified and labeled using the Agilent Low RNA Input Linear Amplification Kit, with Cy3- or Cy5-CTP (Perkin Elmer), and cRNA was hybridized on Agilent 4×44k C. elegans arrays. A dye swap replicate was performed for each set of biological replicate samples as previously described18. Data were extracted with Agilent Feature Extraction software and submitted to the Princeton University Microarray database for storage and filtering (http://puma.princeton.edu).

Microarray analysis

Data were filtered to remove spots that were not above background intensity in both channels, and replicate spots within each array were averaged. Genes for which more than 20% of data were missing across replicates were removed from further analysis. One-class SAM analysis was used to identify genes that were significantly up- or downregulated across all replicates in a set50. Expression profiles were clustered using Cluster 3.051 and visualized using Java TreeView52. Up- and downregulated genes identified by SAM analysis were submitted to DAVID53 to identify overrepresented functional annotations. Annotations used were: Gene ontology (GO) Biological Process FAT (GO BP, filtered by DAVID to remove the broadest GO terms), GO Molecular Function, Kegg Pathway, and Interpro Protein Domains. The Benjamini test for multiple hypothesis testing was applied to P values. Up- and downregulated genes were also submitted to GOToolBox to perform a hypergeometric test using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Enriched GO Terms were submitted to ReviGO to remove redundant terms. Co-occurrence between our datasets and previously published datasets was visualized with GeneVenn54 and BioInfoRx Area-Proportional Venn Diagram.

Motif analysis

We used two distinct algorithms, Weeder55 and FIRE56 to perform an unbiased search for overrepresented sequences in the promoters of SKN-1-regulated genes that were identified by SAM. We submitted upstream sequences (1000 bp) to Weeder and performed a scan for motifs of length 6 and 8 (“Normal” scan mode). FIRE was run using default parameters, with all genes partitioned into three groups to identify motifs that are informative about each group: SKN-1-upregulated, SKN-1-downregulated, and background. To search in a directed manner for occurrence of the consensus SKN-1 binding motif, we used RSATools57 to search the 600 bp upstream of up- and downregulated targets for the SKN-1 binding motif (WWTRTCAT). For comparison with the percentage of promoters in a random sample of genes that would be expected to contain the SKN-1 motif, we searched for the motif in 10,000 random samplings of gene promoter sets of equal size to the number of up- or downregulated genes, to empirically determine a distribution. To calculate a P value, we z-transformed the percentage of SKN-1 target promoters (z = (%  - mu)/sigma), where mu and sigma are the mean and standard deviation of the distribution.

Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) Assays

For validation of the microarray data with skn-1 and daf-16 mutants, C. elegans were allowed to lay eggs for 3–4 hours on RNAi plates. After 2–4 days (depending upon the temperature and strain), 200 L4 worms were harvested (15°C for Extended Data Fig. 2c; 20°C Extended Data Fig. 2m–t). For adult RNAi, one-day adults were placed on RNAi plates and 3–8 days later 100–200 worms were harvested (Fig. 2a–c and Extended Data Fig. 4b). For rapamycin treatment, one-day old animals were placed on plates containing rapamycin (100µM) dissolved in 0.2% DMSO or in 0.2% DMSO control as described in14 and three days later mRNA was harvested for qRT-PCR (Extended Data Fig. 3l–m). For the glp-1 experiment, glp-1(bn18) or wild type (N2) animals were maintained at 15°C and L2 worms were upshifted to 25°C. One-day adults were placed on L4440 (empty vector RNAi) plates at 20°C and 3 days later 200 worms were harvested (Extended Data Fig. 3p–q). RNA was isolated with Trizol (TRI REAGENT Sigma), DNAse-treated, and cleaned over a column (RNA Clean & Concentrator™ ZYMO Research). First-strand cDNA was synthesized in duplicate from each sample (Invitogen SuperScript III). SYBR green was used to perform qRT-PCR (ABI 7900). For each primer set, a standard curve from genomic DNA accompanied the duplicate cDNA samples58. mRNA levels relative to N2 control were determined by normalizing to the number of worms and the geometric mean of three reference genes (cdc-42, pmp-3, and Y45F10D.459). Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 17. Except for col-12/13, primers bind uniquely to the corresponding gene transcript (Supplementary Table 14 and 17). At least two biological replicates were examined for each sample. For statistical analysis, one sample t-test, two-tailed, hypothetical mean of 1 was used for comparison using Prism 4.0a software (GraphPad).

Oxidative stress assays

In oxidative stress assays, day-one daf-2 or skn-1 adults were placed in 5 mM sodium arsenite (in 1mL H O) at 20°C and scored for survival hourly (Supplementary Table 7). For RNAi oxidative stress assays, wild type (N2) or daf-2(e1370) day-one adults were placed on RNAi plates at 15°C, and three days later animals were placed either on plates containing 15.4 mM t-BOOH and scored hourly at 20°C, or in 5 mM sodium arsenite (in 1mL M9 buffer) and scored after 21 hours (N2) or 30 hours (daf-2) at 20°C (Extended Data Fig. 6j–l and Supplementary Table 16).

Age-related phenotypic marker and body-size assays

Age-related phenotypes were described in60. One-day old animals were placed on RNAi food until day 10 of adulthood and the following phenotypes were scored: (1) Pharyngeal pumping was determined by counting grinder movements in 20 second intervals when the animals were placed on food (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6m); (2) Lipofuscin levels were determined by mounting animals onto slides and taking bright field and DAPI channel pictures with a Zeiss Imager M2 microscope. Blue fluorescence from the DAPI channel pictures were analysed in Image J (imagej.nih.gov/ij/) by selecting the intestine and measuring the mean grey value minus the background (Fig. 4b); (3) The body size was determined from bright field images by drawing a line through the middle of the worm from anterior to posterior by using Zeiss Zen 2012 software (Extended Data Fig. 6a).

Collagen assays

Synchronized L1 larvae were placed on 10 cm NGM plates containing OP50 bacteria at 15°C, 20°C, or 25°C and monitored for development to the L4 stage. After an additional day, day-one adults were either harvested for the assay (Extended Data Fig. 7b), or placed on either 10 cm OP50 or RNAi plates containing 50 µM 5-Fluoro-2’deoxyuridine (FUdR) and maintained at the corresponding temperature. At day 8 of adulthood, the remaining animals were harvested (Fig. 4d, 4e). In each case, the animals were washed 3 times with M9, the number of worms was determined, and at least 3000 worms per strain and condition were used for the assay. Collagen levels were determined using the QuickZyme Biosciences Total Collagen Kit (QZBTOTCOL1), which detects Hydroxyproline 61, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Barrier function assay

One-day old adults were placed on RNAi food and at day 9 were harvested, washed 3 times with M9 and incubated in 1µg/ml Hoechst (Hoechst 33342, which is cuticle-impermeable but membrane-permeable) for 15 minutes in darkness at room temperature. The animals were then washed 3 times in M9, allowed to recover for 10 minutes on plates with food, and mounted for microscopy (Extended Data Fig. 6b, 6c; method adapted from 62).

Extended Data Table 1 skn-1 dependence of daf-2 lifespan extension in the absence of dauer-related mechanismsLifespans were measured from the L4 stage, and animals that left the plates, buried into the agar, bagged, or exploded were censored. Analyses performed in parallel are grouped. L4440 empty vector was used as the RNAi control. Each skn 1 mutant analysed is a strong loss-of-function and possible null. The Class 2 alleles daf-2(e1370) and daf-2(m596) have comparably extended lifespans at 20°C and 15°C (Supplementary Table 2). daf-2(e1370);skn-1 double mutants lived 55% longer at 20°C than at 15°C (Supplementary Table 2), because skn-1–independent dauer-related processes increase their lifespan at the higher temperature (see text). This finding is striking given that C. elegans generally lives longer at lower temperatures1 (Supplementary Table 2). Previous analyses of these transgenically-rescued daf-16 strains showed that DAF-16 expression specifically in neurons rescues the dauer but not longevity phenotypes of daf-2(e1370), whereas intestine-specific DAF-16 rescue allows lifespan extension but not dauer entry15.. Extended Data Table 2 Collagen genes are upregulated by diverse interventions that increase lifespanCollagens were overrepresented in each C. elegans longevity-associated gene set we examined. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment clusters were identified by DAVID, using high stringency classification. Enrichment scores were ranked from highest (1) to lowest (>10). Additional information is provided in Supplementary Table 10, including P-values that were determined by DAVID using the Fisher Exact test53,78,79.. Extended Data Table 3 Suppression of lifespan extension by adulthood collagen gene knockdownLifespans were measured and presented as in Extended Data Table 1, and one-day old animals were placed on RNAi plates. Additional related experiments are shown in Supplementary Table 13. col-10 and col-12 share >99% protein sequence identity with col-144 col-13, respectively. In analysis of glp-1(bn18), both N2 and glp-1 animals were upshifted from 15°C to 25°C from the mid-L1 stage until the first day of adulthood, then lifespan analysis was performed at 20°C..

  “When maintained at 15°C, daf-2(e1370) mutants (Class 2) are mobile throughout their lifespan as shown here at day 14 of adulthood (10 min; 8x speed).” “When upshifted from 15°C to 20°C at the first day of adulthood, daf-2(e1370) is typical of other Class 2 mutants in that it becomes relatively immobile during much of its adult lifespan, as shown here at day 14 (10 min; 8x speed).”

 , Data from this study illustrating that rIIS longevity dependence upon skn-1 correlates with low dauer pathway activity, not temperature or percent increase in mean lifespan extension.  , Partial schematic of the IIS pathway in C. elegans. Insulin-like peptides (ins) bind to DAF-2, leading to activation of the AKT-1/2 and possibly SGK-1 kinases1,13,80, which phosphorylate DAF-16 and SKN-1. Class 1 daf-2 mutations are typically located on the extracellular portion of DAF-2, whereas most Class 2 mutations affect its intracellular domains81.  , daf-2 mutant phenotypes.

For additional information see Supplementary Table 2.  , skn-1-dependence of daf-2(e1370) longevity at 20°C when DAF-16 is expressed specifically in the intestine (strain description in Extended Data Table 1).  , Intestine-specific DAF-16 expression fails to rescue a Class 2 dauer-like trait (immobility) in daf-2(e1370).  , Condition-specific induction of dauer by daf-2 RNAi. daf-2 RNAi fails to induce dauer entry even at 25°C ( ), although some dauers are seen under more extreme conditions (27°C)82. The activity of IIS and DAF-16 in neurons is critical for dauer regulation15,16,83, and in the wild-type RNAi is comparatively ineffective in neurons84, suggesting that the extremely weak dauer propensity of daf-2 RNAi might derive from a failure to reduce IIS sufficiently in neurons. Supporting this idea, daf-2 RNAi induced dauer entry even at 20°C in eri-1(mg366); lin-15B(n744) mutants, in which neuronal RNAi is robust85 ( ). N>100 for each condition, 2 merged trials.  , Robust SKN-1 and DAF-16 nuclear localization under conditions of dauer inactivity. SKN-1 nuclear accumulation is inhibited comparably by IIS at 15°C and 20°C.

Columns represent biological samples. blue = down; black = unregulated.  , Confirmation of microarray data for SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) genes by qRT-PCR at 15°C. One and three biological replicates were analysed in the left and right panels, respectively. SAM scores are in Supplementary Table 3. Data are represented as mean ± s.e.m. P values *<0.05, **<0.001, ***<0.0001 relative to daf-2 were determined by one sample t-test, two-tailed, hypothetical mean of 1.  , Enrichment of SKN-1 binding sites upstream of SKN-1-regulated daf-2(−) genes. An unbiased search using the Weeder and FIRE algorithms did not detect any overrepresented form of the consensus SKN-1 binding motif (WWTRTCAT) (W=A/T, R=G/A)86. Given the degeneracy of this motif, we used RSA Tools to perform a directed search of 600 bp upstream of SKN-1 upregulated ( ) and downregulated ( ) genes. This search window was based upon the location of SKN-1 binding sites identified by genome-wide ChIP-seq using transgenically-expressed SKN-187. A SKN-1 motif was detected at only 13% of a random sample of 10,000 genes, but at 37% and 24% of the SKN-1-upregulated (out of 429 genes) and downregulated genes (out of 477 genes), respectively.  , Importance of SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) genes for daf-2(e1368) lifespan. The Class 1 daf-2 allele e1368 is partially dependent upon skn-1 for lifespan extension at 20°C (Extended Data Table 1)13. Adult RNAi against 5 of 12 genes tested reduced daf-2(e1368) lifespan at 20°C.  , Several SKN-1-downregulated daf-2(−) genes decrease lifespan. Knockdown was performed in the RNAi-sensitive strain rrf-3(pk1426)88. ( ) Genes for which RNAi knockdown increased lifespan, from 12 that were analysed without regard to their function. ( ) Analysis of 6 Skp1-related genes, an overrepresented category among SKN-1-downregulated daf-2(−) genes (Supplementary Table 8). Only genes that affected lifespan are shown. Other data and all statistics are in Supplementary Table 6. For 15 other SKN-1-downregulated daf-2(−) genes, it has been shown previously that RNAi increases lifespan (Supplementary Table 5). ( ) and ( ) each show a single trial, and a composite of 3 trials is shown in ( ). In ( ) the negative RNAi control is elpc-4(RNAi) instead of L4440. Mean lifespan (days) is indicated for each gene.  , Overlap between the daf-2(−); SKN-1-dependent upregulated gene set (429 genes, this study) and a set of genes preferentially upregulated in dauers (358 genes)89. The overlap of 6 genes was not significant (P-value 0.6391 by two-sided Chi-square). The number of genes that were present in neither set (no/no) was determined by subtracting the total number in both gene sets from the total number of genes encoded in C. elegans 19,73590.  , Overlaps between SKN-1-regulated daf-2(−) and DAF-16-regulated daf-2(−) gene sets72. For both up- and down-regulated daf-2(−) genes, overlaps between the SKN-1- and DAF-16-regulated sets were significant (P-value <0.0001 determined by two-sided Chi-square). Moreover, hierarchical clustering identified additional SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) genes that were also upregulated by DAF-16 even though they were not present in this list of highest-confidence DAF-16-regulated genes ( ). The number of genes that were in neither set (no/no) was determined as ( ).  , Hierarchical clustering of SKN-1-downregulated daf-2(−) gene sets with DAF-16-regulated genes. SKN-1-regulated genes identified here were queried as to how they were influenced by DAF-16 in a comparison of daf-2(e1370) vs daf-2(e1370);daf-16(mu86) animals raised at 20°C72. 393 SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) genes that were present in this DAF-16-regulated dataset are shown. Most SKN-1-downregulated daf-2(−) genes did not appear to be regulated by DAF-16.  , Hierarchical clustering of SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) genes with DAF-16-regulated genes that were identified by comparing daf-2(e1370) vs daf-2(e1370);daf-16(mu86) at 20°C72. 272 SKN-1-upregulated daf-2(−) genes that were present in this DAF-16-regulated dataset are shown, 46% of which were upregulated by both SKN-1 and DAF-16. yellow = up; blue = down; black = unregulated.  , Effects of SKN-1 and DAF-16 on individual genes in response to daf-2 RNAi at 20°C. A qRT-PCR analysis of skn-1(zu67) daf-16(mgDf47), and skn-1;daf-16 skn-1(zu67); daf-16(mgDf47) double mutants indicated that many genes are upregulated by daf-2(RNAi) (red) in a skn-1-dependent manner, but also that these genes vary in how they are affected by DAF-16. DAF-16 and SKN-1 increased activity of gst-4 col-65, and col-176, but DAF-16 seemed to downregulate dod-24 nas-7, and F55G11.2. All of these genes except ins-7 were identified in our daf-2;skn-1 data sets. For each condition, 3 biological samples of 200 worms each were analysed by qRT-PCR. All data are represented as mean ± s.e.m. P values of *<0.05, **<0.001, ***<0.0001 relative to wild type RNAi control were determined by one sample t-test, two-tailed, hypothetical mean of 1.

 , Age-associated decline in expression of selected collagen and SKN-1-dependent detoxification genes. 88 collagens are among many genes that decline in expression as C. elegans ages22. Fifty of these age-downregulated genes were in our SKN-1 upregulated daf-2(−) gene set, including 27 collagen genes (Supplementary Table 10). These daf-2(−); SKN-1-dependent collagens were neither flanked by SKN-1 binding sites nor bound by SKN-1 in a genome-wide survey (Supplementary Table 9)87, suggesting that they are regulated by SKN-1 indirectly. The average Cy5-labeled cDNA values of day 2–11 adults (indicated as “exp”) are plotted in binary logarithm (log ) relative to cy3-labeled reference cDNA from mixed stage hermaphrodites (indicated as “ref”). Data are from22. nit-1 gst-4, and F56D5.3 are predicted to encode a nitrilase, glutathione S-transferase, and NADPH oxidoreductase, respectively (WormBase).  , Expression of SKN-1-regulated collagen and oxidative stress response genes (nit-1 and gst-4) are maintained during ageing in daf-2(RNAi) animals. One-day old adult wild type (N2) animals were placed on either empty vector control (L4440)(black) or daf-2 RNAi (red) at 20°C. mRNA was harvested at days 3, 6 and 8. mRNA levels are shown relative to wild type (N2) day 3 adults on empty vector control (L4440) RNAi and are represented as mean ± s.e.m. For each condition, 2 biological samples of >100 worms each were analysed by qRT-PCR. For each gene, statistical difference of relative mRNA expression levels between L4440 and daf-2(RNAi) treatment over the time-course (day 3,6,8) is shown by two-way ANOVA (repeated measures).  , Adulthood knockdown of SKN-1-upregulated collagens did not affect wild-type lifespan (for statistics and additional trials: Extended Data Table 3 and Supplementary Table 13).  , Importance of SKN-1-upregulated collagens for daf-2(RNAi) longevity.

For details and statistics see Supplementary Table 13.  , daf-2(e1370) longevity at 15°C requires the SKN-1-upregulated extracellular proteases asp-14 and suro-1, along with cuticle integrity genes acs-20 and acs-2262, suggesting a general importance of ECM gene expression. For details and statistics see Supplementary Table 13.

Permeability was assessed by nuclear Hoechst staining in the tail62 (N>50 per condition; 1 trial). Approximately half of the animals in each group showed nuclear staining in the tail that is likely to have arisen through uptake in the intestine, as suggested by the high levels of intestinal Hoechst staining ( ).

Day-one adult wild-type animals were placed RNAi food for 3 days, and then on plates containing food and high concentrations of salt for 24 hours prior to assay (NaCl: 450 mM, 500 mM, 600 mM; N>60 per condition; 2 trials).  , Adulthood knockdown of SKN-1-upregulated collagens did not impair body movement. Neither the frequency nor morphology (not shown) of body movement was affected. In parallel, the daf-2 RNAi control increased movement frequency because these animals were chronologically younger.

 , The collagen ROL-6 is present in the cuticle during development and early adulthood93, then largely disappears during aging. The upper panels show the mid-body (left) and head (right) regions in an L4 animal. Day-one adults exhibited similar levels and patterns of jgIs5 ROL-6::GFP fluorescence (not shown). Lower panels show the corresponding regions in a day-8 adult, in which jgIs5 ROL-6::GFP levels are reduced. The orange signal corresponds to gut autofluorescence. Representative images are shown, with scale bar = 20 µm. N=30 for each sample set (L4, day 1, and day 8).  , Total collagen levels are elevated in long-lived animals at the first day of adulthood. Note that these long-lived animals also maintain higher collagen levels in later life despite an age-related decline (Fig. 4d). Relative collagen levels were estimated by a hydroxyproline assay61. In daf-2 mutants total collagen levels were elevated at both temperatures but the increase was greater at 15°C, at which skn-1 and SKN-1-dependent collagens are required for lifespan extension (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 13). Temperature-sensitive glp-1(bn18) mutants were maintained at 15°C (permissive temperature), or upshifted to 25°C (restrictive temperature) as L1 larvae until the L4 stage, then placed at 20°C.  , SKN-1-dependent collagen genes from the daf-2(−) set are not upregulated in 8 day-old daf-2(e1370) adults at 20°C. Expression of these collagens remains increased at this age in daf-2(e1370) at 15°C or after daf-2 RNAi at 20°C (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2c, 4b), conditions in which the dauer pathway is inactive and lifespan extension is skn-1-dependent (see text). 200 day-8 adults were assayed in each sample, with 3 merged independent trials shown.  , Scoring categories for the Pcol-144::GFP reporter are shown in ( ; Fig. 4f; scale bar = 100 µm).  , Adulthood rapamycin treatment increases col-144 promoter activity.
