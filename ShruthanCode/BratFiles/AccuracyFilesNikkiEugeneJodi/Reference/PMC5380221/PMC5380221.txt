FOXO1 couples metabolic activity and growth state in the vascular endothelium

Abstract

Endothelial cells (ECs) are plastic cells that can switch between growth states with different bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements1. Although quiescent in most healthy tissues, ECs divide and migrate rapidly upon proangiogenic stimulation2,3. Adjusting endothelial metabolism to growth state is central to normal vessel growth and function1,4, yet poorly understood at the molecular level. Here we report that the forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor FOXO1 is an essential regulator of vascular growth that couples metabolic and proliferative activities in ECs. Endothelial-restricted deletion of FOXO1 in mice induces a profound increase in EC proliferation that interferes with coordinated sprouting, thereby causing hyperplasia and vessel enlargement. Conversely, forced expression of FOXO1 restricts vascular expansion and leads to vessel thinning and hypobranching. We find that FOXO1 acts as a gatekeeper of endothelial quiescence, which decelerates metabolic activity by reducing glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Mechanistically, FOXO1 suppresses signalling by c-MYC (termed MYC hereafter), a powerful driver of anabolic metabolism and growth5,6. MYC ablation impairs glycolysis, mitochondrial function and proliferation of ECs while its EC-specific overexpression fuels these processes. Moreover, restoration of MYC signalling in FOXO1-overexpressing endothelium normalises metabolic activity and branching behaviour. Our findings identify FOXO1 as a critical rheostat of vascular expansion and define the FOXO1 – MYC transcriptional network as a novel metabolic checkpoint during endothelial growth and proliferation.

FOXOs are effectors of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) / AKT pathway that links growth and metabolism7,8. PI3K signalling inhibits FOXOs through AKT-mediated phosphorylation leading to their nuclear exclusion9,10. We investigated the role of FOXO1 in ECs, an enriched FOXO family member in the endothelium11-15. To this end, we bred floxed Foxo1 mice (Foxo1flox)16 with a Tie2-Cre deleter (Extended Data Fig. 1a), which recombines in endothelial and hematopoietic cells. Tie2-Cre-mediated deletion of Foxo1 (Foxo1EC-KO) caused defective vascular development and embryonic lethality around E10.517 (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c), suggesting that endothelial FOXO1 is essential for embryo development.

Immunofluorescence analysis of developing blood vessels in the postnatal retina showed high levels of FOXO1 expression in the endothelium (Fig. 1a). Further examination of the subcellular distribution revealed a diffuse nucleo-cytoplasmic localization of FOXO1 at the angiogenic front, where most of the EC proliferation occurs, but a stronger nuclear pattern in the plexus, where vessels remodel, and endothelial proliferation abates (Fig. 1a). This spatial difference in subcellular localization suggests that FOXO1 is important for governing endothelial growth. To test this, we assessed the impact of Foxo1 deletion on retinal angiogenesis using the tamoxifen-inducible, endothelial-selective Pdgfb-CreERT2 line (Foxo1iEC-KO). Recombination was monitored with the Rosa26-mT/mG (mTmG) reporter that expresses GFP upon Cre-mediated recombination. 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen- (4-OHT) treatment resulted in broad GFP expression in ECs as well as extinction of endothelial FOXO1 staining (Extended Data Fig. 1d-f). Endothelial loss of Foxo1 caused a dense and hyperplastic vasculature and resulted in the inability of ECs to extend proper sprouts (Fig. 1b-f). Instead, ECs grew in clusters leading to vessel enlargement and blunting of the angiogenic front (Fig. 1d,f). Strikingly, numerous filopodial bursts were emanating from the stunted front (Fig. 1c,d), suggesting that FOXO1 deficiency results in uncoordinated vascular growth. Staining Foxo1iEC-KO retinas for ERG (marking endothelial nuclei) and VE-cadherin (marking endothelial junctions), revealed an abundance of abnormally aligned ECs, which formed vessels with wide and irregular lumens (Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). Assessment of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) labelling demonstrated a substantial increase in endothelial proliferation in the Foxo1iEC-KO mutants (Fig. 1g,j and Extended Data Fig. 2d), indicating that deregulated proliferation drives this aberrant vessel phenotype. Importantly, the vascular defects of the Foxo1iEC-KO mice did not normalize at later stages of development, but showed a persistent increase in endothelial number, density and vessel diameter (Fig. 1h,i and Extended Data Fig. 2e-g). We conclude that FOXO1 is a suppressor of endothelial growth and proliferation, whose inactivation leads to uncontrolled overgrowth.

Next, we determined the consequences of FOXO1 activation in ECs. We used a Cre-inducible gain-of-function allele (Foxo1CA) in which the AKT phosphorylation sites are mutated, thus, rendering FOXO1 constitutively nuclear (Extended Data Fig. 3a)18. Tie2-Cre-mediated expression of this IRES-GFP coexpressing mutant (Foxo1EC-CA) was incompatible with embryo survival beyond E10.5 (Fig. 2a), highlighting the sensitivity of ECs towards changes in FOXO1 status. We then used the Pdgfb-CreERT2 strain to express Foxo1CA in the retinal endothelium (Foxo1iEC-CA). Immunofluorescence studies revealed an enriched FOXO1 signal in endothelial nuclei and confirmed the EC-specific expression of GFP (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3b,c,g). Forced activation of FOXO1 led to a sparse and hyperpruned vascular network that contained less ECs (Fig. 2c,d,f-h and Extended Data Fig. 3g). These retinal vessels established a lumen but were thinner and extended fewer filopodia (Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 3d). Staining for BrdU-incorporation and pHH3 revealed a reduction in EC proliferation in Foxo1iEC-CA mice while endothelial apoptosis was not altered (Fig. 2e,f,i and Extended Data Fig. 3e,g). Similar phenotypes were observed in the hindbrain vasculature (Fig. 2j,k and Extended Data Fig. 4a-c), indicating that FOXO1 is a critical driver of endothelial quiescence. To further examine this, we analysed mosaic retinas of mTmG coexpressing control- and Foxo1iEC-CA mice, in which the majority of ECs are un-recombined. Compared to controls, Foxo1iEC-CA mice showed an impaired propagation of GFP-positive ECs in the retinal plexus (Extended Data Fig. 4d-f), arguing that the proquiescent activity of FOXO1 is cell-autonomous.

We next assessed whether FOXO1 regulates endothelial metabolism. Since ECs rely on glycolysis for vessel branching4, we first studied the effects of FOXO1 on this metabolic pathway. Transduction of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with a FOXO1CA-encoding adenovirus (AdFOXO1CA) led to a robust reduction in glycolysis as evidenced by a reduction in extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), glucose uptake, glycolytic flux and lactate production (Fig. 3a-d and Extended Data Fig. 5a). This metabolic phenotype correlates with the reduced proliferation in FOXO1CA-expressing ECs and raises the question whether FOXO1 promotes mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Surprisingly, FOXO1 did not stimulate but instead diminished oxidative metabolism as indicated by a decline in oxygen consumption in AdFOXO1CA-expressing HUVECs (Fig. 3e). Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and ATP levels were decreased (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 5b). Importantly, FOXO1 did not induce endothelial apoptosis, senescence, autophagy or energy distress under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 5c-h). Together, our data indicate that FOXO1 adapts metabolic activity to the lower requirements of the quiescent endothelium.

To gain insight into the underlying mechanisms, we performed transcriptome analysis of FOXO1CA- and GFP-transduced HUVECs. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed an enrichment of the FOXO1 DNA-binding elements in genes induced by FOXO1, while the MYC DNA-binding motif was highly enriched in the repressed genes (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Moreover, MYC target gene signatures were downregulated in the FOXO1 transcriptome (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 6c). Since MYC is a powerful driver of glycolysis, mitochondrial metabolism and growth5, FOXO1 might antagonize endothelial MYC signalling. In line with this, overexpression of FOXO1CA suppressed MYC expression, whereas FOXO1 depletion enhanced MYC levels, both in HUVECs and in ECs derived from the mutant mice (Fig. 3j-l and Extended Data Fig. 6d-h). Immunofluorescence studies in Foxo1iEC-CA retinas confirmed these findings and showed a suppression of endothelial MYC expression (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Accordingly, numerous genes that are induced by MYC were downregulated in FOXO1CA-overexpressing HUVECs including genes involved in cell metabolism and cell-cycle progression (Fig. 3i,l). This regulation is in line with the repression of MYC by FOXOs in cancer cells19-23 and points to MYC as a crucial effector of FOXO1 in the coordination of endothelial metabolism and growth.

Remarkably, FOXO1 also induced the expression of negative regulators of MYC signalling including MXI1, an antagonist of MYC transcriptional activity6, and FBXW7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets MYC for proteasomal degradation6 (Fig. 3l and Extended Data Fig. 7a). Consistent with these findings, MYC protein stability was decreased in FOXO1CA-expressing ECs and co-treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 partially restored MYC protein levels (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). Knockdown of MXI1, on the other hand, did not affect the FOXO1-induced repression of MYC but attenuated the ability of FOXO1 to downregulate MYC target genes (Extended Data Fig. 7d-f). These data are in accordance with the function of MXI1 as a negative regulator of MYC activity6,19,20, and suggest that FOXO1 intersects with MYC signalling at different levels.

To further explore the role of MYC in ECs, we profiled the transcriptome of MYC siRNA-transfected (siMYC) HUVECs. This analysis showed a suppression of MYC signature genes involved in metabolic processes and cell cycle progression and validated the regulation of predicted MYC targets that were repressed by FOXO1 (Extended Data Fig. 8a-g). Bioenergetic analysis revealed that MYC deficiency attenuated glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, whereas adenoviral overexpression of MYC (AdMYC) stimulated these metabolic activities (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 9e). Conditional deletion of Myc (Mycflox)24 in mice using the Pdgfb-CreERT2 deleter impaired vascular expansion and led to a thinned and poorly branched vasculature with reduced EC proliferation (Fig. 4c-e and Extended Data Fig. 9a-d). These phenotypes resemble the vascular defects in Foxo1iEC-CA mutant mice and imply that MYC is a central component of endothelial FOXO1 signalling. To test this directly, we attempted to rescue the endothelial phenotypes imposed by FOXO1 activation by restoring MYC signalling with a Cre-inducible Myc overexpressor allele (MycOE)25. Pdgfb-creERT2-induced overexpression of MYC caused sustained vascular overgrowth and led to a profound increase in EC number, proliferation and vessel density (Fig. 4f,g and Extended Data Fig. 9f-k). We then combined the MycOE, Foxo1CA and Pdgfb-creERT2 alleles to generate endothelial-specific double mutants. Remarkably, reexpression of MYC in ECs of Foxo1iEC-CA mice normalized the hypobranched and hypocellular vascular phenotype caused by FOXO1 activation (Fig. 4h,i and Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Moreover, coexpression of MYC and FOXO1CA in HUVECs restored glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration and ROS formation (Fig. 4j,k and Extended Data Fig S10c), indicating that regulation of MYC signalling by FOXO1 is critical for the coordination of endothelial metabolism and growth.

This study identifies FOXO1 as a critical checkpoint of endothelial growth that restricts vascular expansion. Our data suggest that FOXO1 promotes endothelial quiescence by antagonizing MYC, which leads to a coordinated reduction in the proliferative and metabolic activity of ECs. The FOXO1-induced deceleration of metabolic activity might not only enforce quiescence but also support endothelial function. For instance, by lowering metabolism, ECs will consume less energetic fuel for their homeostatic needs, thereby ensuring efficient nutrient and oxygen delivery. Reducing metabolic activity might also contribute to endothelial redox balance. ECs are long-lived cells that need to protect themselves against oxidative damage exerted by high oxygen levels in the bloodstream. The FOXO1-induced reduction in oxidative metabolism might thus be a mechanism to minimize the production of mitochondria-derived ROS, thereby conferring protection against the high-oxygen environment. Such a role of FOXO1 in endothelial metabolism aligns with the broader function of FOXOs in mediating oxidative stress resistance26-30, and might also explain why ECs are exquisitely sensitive to a change in FOXO1 status. It will now be interesting to determine how endothelial FOXO1 is regulated in vivo and how deregulation contributes to disease.

Methods

Animals and genetic experiments

All conditional Foxo1 and Myc mutant mice were on a C57BL/6 genetic background and generated as described16,18,24,25. For constitutive Cre-mediated recombination in ECs, Foxo1flox or Rosa26-Foxo1CA mice were bred with Tie2-Cre transgenic mice31. To avoid recombination in the female germline, only Tie2-Cre-positive male mice were used for intercrossing. Embryos were collected from Cre-negative females at the indicated time points and genotyping performed from isolated yolk sacs. For inducible Cre-mediated recombination in ECs, floxed mice were bred with transgenic mice expressing the tamoxifen-inducible, Pdgfb promoter-driven CreERT232. The degree of Cre-mediated recombination was assessed with the double fluorescent Cre-reporter Rosa26-mT/mG33 allele, which was crossed into the respective mutant mice. For the analysis of angiogenesis in the postnatal mouse retina, Cre-mediated recombination was induced in newborn mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 25 μl 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT; 2 mg/ml; Sigma-Adrich) from postnatal day (P)1 – P4. Eyes were harvested at P5 or P21 for further analysis. In mosaic recombination experiments, 4-OHT (20 μl/g body weight of 0.02 mg/ml) was intraperitoneally injected at P3 and eyes collected at P5. To induce Cre-mediated recombination in mouse embryos, 100 μl of 4-OHT (10 mg/ml) was injected i.p. into pregnant females from embryonic day (E)8.5 – E10.5. Embryos were harvested at E11.5 for the analysis of angiogenesis in the embryonic hindbrain. The Rosa26-Foxo1CA, Rosa26-Myc, and Rosa26-mT/mG alleles were kept heterozygous for the respective transgene in all experimental studies. Apart from the mosaic studies, control animals were littermate animals without Cre expression. Male and female mice were used for the analysis, which were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Experiments involving animals were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines and laws, following protocols approved by local animal ethics committees and authorities (Regierungspraesidium Darmstadt).

Immunohistochemistry of mouse tissues

To analyse blood vessel growth in the postnatal retina, whole mouse eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) on ice for 1 hour. Eyes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before the retinas were dissected and partially cut into 4 leaflets. After blocking / permeabilization in 2% goat-serum (Vector labs), 1% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100 (in PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature, the retinas were incubated at 4°C overnight in incubation buffer containing 1% goat-serum, 0.5% BSA and 0.25% Triton X-100 (in PBS) and the primary antibody. Primary antibodies against the following proteins were used: cleaved Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology, #9664, 1:100), Collagen IV (AbD Serotec, #2150-1470, 1:400), ERG 1/2/3 (Abcam, #ab92513, 1:200), FOXO1 (Cell Signaling Technology, #2880, 1:100), GFP (Invitrogen, #A21311, 1:100), ICAM2 (BD Biosciences, #553326, 1:200), MYC (Millipore, 06-340, 1:100), PECAM-1 (R&D Systems, AF3628, 1:400), phospho-histone H3 (Chemicon, #06-570, 1:100), TER119 (BD Biosciences, #553670, 1:100), and VE-Cadherin (BD Biosciences, #555289, 1:25). After 4 washes with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST), retinas were incubated with Alexa-Fluor 488-, Alexa-Fluor 555- or Alexa-Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:400) for 2 hours at room temperature. For staining ECs with isolectin B4 (iB4), retinas were washed with PBLEC buffer (1 mM CaCl , 1 mM MgCl , 1 mM MnCl  and 1% Triton X-100 in PBS) and incubated with biotinylated iB4 (Griffonia simplicifolia, #B1205, Vector labs, 1:100) diluted in PBLEC buffer. After washing, retinas were incubated in Alexa-Fluor-coupled streptavidin (Invitrogen, #S21374, 1:200) for 2 h at room temperature. For nuclear counterstain, retinas were incubated with DAPI (Sigma Aldrich, #D9542, 1:1000) for 15 min following washes with PBST and PBS. The labelling of proliferating cells with 5-bromo-2′ deoxyuridine (BrdU) was performed in P5 pups. In brief, 50 mg/kg of BrdU (Invitrogen, #B23151) per pup was injected intraperitoneally 3 h before they were sacrifized. Retinas were fixed for 2 h in 4% PFA and then incubated for 1 h in 65°C warm formamide, followed by an incubation of 30 min in 2N HCl. Afterwards retinas were washed twice with 0.1M Tris-HCl (pH8) and then blocked in 1% BSA, 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS and incubated overnight at 4°C with a mouse anti-BrdU antibody (BD Biosciences, #347580, 1:50). The detection was performed with Alexa Fluor-488 anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen, A21202, 1:400). After the BrdU staining, retinas were processed for the iB4 staining as described above. The dissection of the embryonic hindbrain was performed as described34. Following overnight fixation in 4% PFA, dissected hindbrains were incubated in a blocking solution containing 10% serum, 1% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS at 4°C. After washes with PBS, hindbrains were incubated for 1 h in PBLEC buffer prior to the overnight incubation with Alexa Fluor-conjugated iB4 (Invitrogen, #I21411, 1:100 in PBLEC) at 4°C. Hindbrains were washed with PBS and stained with DAPI. Retinas and embryonic hindbrains were flat-mounted with Vectashield (Vector labs) and examined by confocal laser microscopy (Leica TCS SP5 or SP8). Immunostainings were carried out in tissues from littermates and processed under the same conditions.

Immunohistochemistry of cell cultures

HUVECs were seeded on glass bottom culture dishes (Mattek) and cultured at 37°C and 5% CO . To detect autophagy, cells were washed and fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature. Permeabilisation was performed in 1% BSA, 10% donkey serum and 0.5% Tween-20 in PBS. Cells were stained for anti-LC3A/B (Cell signaling Technology, #12741, 1:400), Phalloidin-TRITC (Sigma Aldrich, #P1951, 1:500) and DAPI in incubation buffer (0.5% BSA, 5% donkey serum and 0.25% Tween-20 in PBS). Following washes with PBST, samples were incubated with AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:200). Cells were washed and mounted in VectaShield. As a positive control, HUVECs were treated with 50 μM Chloroquine overnight prior to fixation.

Image acquisition and processing

Stained tissue / cells were analysed at high resolution with a TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Leica). Volocity (Perkin Elmer), Fiji / ImageJ, Photoshop (Adobe) and Adobe Illustrator (Adobe) software were used for image acquisition and processing. For all of the images in which the levels of immunostaining were compared, settings for laser excitation and confocal scanner detection were kept constant between groups.

Quantitative analysis of the retinal and hindbrain vasculature

All quantifications were done on high-resolution confocal images of thin z sections of the sample using the Volocity (Perkin Elmer) software. In the retina, endothelial coverage, the number of endothelial branchpoints, and the average vessel branch diameter were quantified behind the angiogenic front in a region between an artery and a vein. In the embryonic hindbrain, randomly chosen fields were used to quantify the vascularization in the ventricular zone. All parameters were quantified in a minimum of four vascularized fields per sample. Endothelial coverage was determined by assessing the ratio of the iB4-positive area to the total area of the vascularized field (sized 200 μm × 200 μm), and expressed as percentage of the area covered by iB4-positive ECs. Average vessel diameter was analysed by assessing the diameter of individual vessel branches in a vascularized field (sized 200 μm × 200 μm), which was used to calculate the mean diameter in each field. The diameter of individual vessel branches was averaged from three measurements taken at the proximal, middle and distal part of the vessel segment. The number of filopodial extensions was quantified at the angiogenic front. The total number of filopodia was normalized to a vessel length of 100 μm at the angiogenic front, which was defined and measured according to published protocols35. For quantifying vascular outgrowth in the mouse retina, the distance of vessel growth from the centre of the optic nerve to the periphery was measured in each leaflet of a dissected retina, which was used to calculate the mean value for each sample. The number of ERG-/iB4- and BrdU-/iB4-labelled cells was counted in at least 4 fields sized 200 μm × 200 μm per sample. Because of the lower incidence of pHH3-positive ECs, the number of pHH3-/iB4- double-positive cells was quantified in larger fields (sized 580 μm × 580 μm). For the quantification of the mosaic control (Pdgfb-CreERT2;Rosa26-Foxo1+/+;Rosa26-mTmGflox/+) and Foxo1iEC-CA (Pdgfb-CreERT2;Rosa26-Foxo1CA/+;Rosa26-mTmGflox/+) retinas, the GFP/IB4 double-positive area per field was determined and divided by the total IB4-positive area. The percentage of the GFP/IB4 double-positive area per total IB4 area was measured in 4 fields (400 μm × 400 μm) per sample and used to calculate the mean value. For the quantification of nuclear FOXO1 expression in control and Foxo1iEC-CA mice, high-resolution confocal images were taken with a 40x objective. The resulting images were analysed with the Bitplane Imaris software. Vessels were first segmented using the Surface module in Imaris. FOXO1 immunofluorescence was then used to set a threshold in the new vascular surface area, in which only CD31-positive nuclei were selected (Surface module). The sum intensity of the nuclear FOXO1 fluorescence was divided by the total vascular area to adjust for differences in vascular density on each image. An average of 6 images per sample was quantified in 3 animals per group. All of the images shown are representative of the vascular phenotype observed in samples from at least two distinct litters per group.

Cell culture

Pooled human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Lonza and authenticated by marker expression (CD31/CD105 double-positive) and morphology. HUVECs were cultured in endothelial basal medium (EBM, Lonza) supplemented with hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml), bovine brain extract (12 μg/ml), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), amphotericin B (50 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies). HUVECs were tested negative for mycoplasma and cultured until the fourth passage. The isolation of mouse lung ECs was performed as described36. In brief, adult mice were sacrificed, lungs removed, and incubated with dispase. The homogenate was filtered through a cell strainer, collected by centrifugation, and washed with PBS containing 0.1% BSA (PBSB). The resulting cell suspension was incubated with rat anti-mouse VE-Cadherin antibody- (BD Pharmingen, #555289) coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen, #11035). Next, the beads were washed with PBSB and then re-suspended in D-MEM/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% FCS, endothelial growth factor (Promocell, #c-30140), penicillin and streptomycin. The isolated cells were seeded on gelatin-coated culture dishes and re-purified with the VE-Cadherin antibody during the first three passages.

Adenoviral infection

Sub-confluent HUVECs were infected with adenoviruses to overexpress constitutively active human FOXO1-Flag (FOXO1CA)37, human c-MYC-HA38 (Vector Biolabs) and GFP or LacZ as a control. HUVECs (70–80% confluent) were incubated in EBM containing 0.1% BSA for 4 h. Prior to infection, adenoviruses were incubated with an antennapedia-derived peptide (Eurogentec) to facilitate the infection. The mixture was then applied to the HUVECs cultured in EBM containing 0.1% BSA and incubated for 4 h. Thereafter, the cells were washed five times and cultured in EBM with 10% FCS and supplements. The adenoviral infection of murine ECs was performed with adenoviruses encoding for Cre or GFP (Vector Biolabs) as a control.

RNA interference

To silence FOXO1, MYC or MXI1 gene expression, HUVECs were transfected with a pool of siRNA duplexes directed against human FOXO1, human c-MYC or human MXI1 (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool, Dharmacon). A negative control pool of four siRNAs designed and microarray-tested for minimal targeting of human, mouse or rat genes was used as a control (ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting pool, Dharmacon). HUVECs were transfected with 50 nM of the indicated siRNAs using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Microarray and gene set enrichment analysis

Total RNA quality was verified using the Agilent Bioanalyser and the 6000 nano kit. RNA was labelled according to the Affymetrix Whole Transcript Sense Target Labelling protocol. Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays were hybridized, processed and scanned using the appropriate Affymetrix protocols. Data were analysed using the Affymetrix expression console using the RMA algorithm, statistical analysis was done using DNAStar Arraystar 11. Heat maps were generated using GENE-E, publicly available from the Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/). For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), gene set collections from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) 4.0 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/) were used for the analysis of the endothelial FOXO1 and MYC transcriptomes.

RNA extraction and quantitative realtime-PCR (qRT-PCR)

RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed on 2 μg of total RNA using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). qPCR was performed with TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan probes (TaqMan Gene Expression Assays) available from Applied Biosystems. TaqMan Gene Expression Assays used were as follows: human ACTB Hs99999903_m1; CCNB2 Hs00270424_m1; CCND1 Hs00765553_m1; CCND2 Hs00153380_m1; CDK4 Hs00262861_m1; c-MYC Hs00153408_m1; ENO1 Hs00361415_m1; FASN Hs01005622_m1; FBXW7 Hs00217794_m1; FOXO1 Hs01054576_m1; LDHA Hs00855332_g1; LDHB Hs00929956_m1; MXI1 Hs00365651_m1; PKM2 Hs00987254_m1. Mouse probes were: Actb Mm 00607939_s1; Myc Mm00487804_m1. All qPCR reactions were run on a StepOnePlus real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems) and data were calculated using the ΔΔCt method.

Western blot analysis and antibodies

Western blot analyses were performed with precast gradient gels (Bio-Rad) using standard methods. Briefly, HUVECs were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mix (Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor cocktail tablets, Roche) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed with specific primary antibodies and then with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The following antibodies were used: AMPKα (Cell Signaling Technology, #2532, 1:1000), Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology, #9662, 1:1000), cleaved Caspase 3 (Asp175) (Cell Signaling Technology, #9664, 1:1000), cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling Technology, #5625, 1:1000), c-MYC (Cell Signaling Technology, #9402, 1:1000), FBXW7 (Abcam, #12292, 1:500), Flag M2 (Sigma, #F-3165, 1:1000), FOXO1 (Cell Signaling Technology, #2880, 1:1000), HA (Covance, clone 16B12, MMS-101P), 1:1000), LC3A/B (Cell Signaling Technology, #12741, 1:1000), MXI1 (Santa Cruz, SC-1042, 1:500), P-ACC (Cell Signaling Technology, #3661, 1:1000), P-AMPKα (Thr172) (Cell Signaling Technology, #2535, 1:1000), PARP (Cell Signaling Technology, #9532, 1:1000), Tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology, #2148, 1:1000). The bands were visualised by chemiluminescence using an ECL detection kit (Clarity Western ECL Substrate, Bio-Rad) and a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad). The gel source data of the Western blot analysis is illustrated in Supplementary Figure 1. Quantification of band intensities by densitometry was carried out using the Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).

Metabolic Assays

Extracellular acidification (ECAR) and oxygen consumption (OCR) rates were measured using the Seahorse XFe96 analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, ECAR and OCR were measured 4 h after seeding HUVECs (40.000 cells per well) on fibronectin-coated XFe96 microplates. HUVECs were maintained in non-buffered assay medium in a non-CO  incubator for 1 h before the assay. The Glycolysis stress test kit (Seahorse Bioscience) was used to monitor the extracellular acidification rate under various conditions. Three baseline recordings were made, followed by sequential injection of glucose (10 mM), the mitochondrial / ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin (3 μM), and the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG; 100 mM). The Mito stress test kit was used to assay the mitochondrial respiration rate under basal conditions, in the presence of the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin (3 μM), the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl-hydrazone (FCCP; 1 μM), and the respiratory chain inhibitors antimycin A (1.5 μM) and rotenone (3 μM). To measure glycolysis in ECs, HUVECs were incubated for 2 hours in growth medium containing 80 mCi/mmol [5-3H]-D-glucose (Perkin Elmer). Thereafter, supernatant was transferred into glass vials sealed with rubber stoppers. 3H O was captured in hanging wells containing a Whatman paper soaked with H O over a period of 48 hours at 37°C to reach saturation4. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting and normalized to protein content. Lactate concentration in the HUVEC culture media was measured by using a Lactate assay kit (Biovision) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Glucose uptake was assessed by analysing the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) with a Colorimetric Assay (BioVision). ATP was measured from lysates from HUVECs (1× 106/ml) with an ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit CLS II (Roche) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

Intracellular ROS measurement

Intracellular ROS levels were determined using CM-H DCFDA dye (Life technologies). Dye was reconstituted in DMSO (10mM) and diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing CaCl  and MagCl  as working solution. 24 hours post transduction, 1 × 106 cells were incubated in 1 ml working solution for 40 min at 37°C in the dark. Subsequently fluorescence of 10,000 living endothelial cells per sample was measured at the BD FACS LSR II flow cytometer. The assays were performed with adenoviruses, which did not co-express fluorescent reporter genes. Data were analysed using BD FACSDiva software (Version 8.0.1).

Senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining

To detect senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity in HUVECs, a cellular senescence assay kit (#KAA002, Chemicon) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were fixed in 1 ml Fixing Solution at room temperature for 15 min. 2 ml of freshly prepared SA-β-gal Detection Solution was added and cells were incubated overnight at 37°C without CO  and protected from light. Then Detection solution was removed and cells were washed and mounted in 70% glycerol in PBS. H O -treated HUVECs were used as a positive control.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test, or non-parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test unless mentioned otherwise. For all bar graphs, data are represented as mean ± s.d. P values < 0.05 were considered significant. All calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism software. No randomization or blinding was used and no animals were excluded from the analysis. Sample sizes were selected on the basis of published protocols34,35 and previous experiments. Several independent experiments were performed to guarantee reproducibility and robustness of findings.
