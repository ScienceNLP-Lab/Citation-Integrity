OCT4 as a target of miR-34a stimulates p63 but inhibits p53 to promote human cell transformation

Abstract

Human cell transformation is a key step for oncogenic development, which involves multiple pathways; however, the mechanism remains unclear. To test our hypothesis whether cell oncogenic transformation shares some mechanisms with the process of reprogramming non-stem cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), we studied the relationship among the key factors for promoting or inhibiting iPSC in radiation-transformed human epithelial cell lines derived from different tissues (lung, breast and colon). We unexpectedly found that p63 and OCT4 were highly expressed (accompanied by low expressed p53 and miR-34a) in all transformed cell lines examined when compared with their non-transformed counterparts. We further elucidated the relationship of these factors: the 3p strand of miR-34a directly targeted OCT4 by binding to the 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR) of OCT4 and, OCT4, in turn, stimulated p63 but inhibited p53 expression by binding to a specific region of the p63 or p53 promoter. Moreover, we revealed that the effects of OCT4 on promoting cell oncogenic transformation were by affecting p63 and p53. These results support that a positive loop exists in human cells: OCT4 upregulation as a consequence of inhibition of miR-34a, promotes p63 but suppresses p53 expression, which further stimulates OCT4 upregulation by downregulating miR-34a. This functional loop contributes significantly to cell transformation and, most likely, also to the iPSC process.

Human cell transformation is an initial key step from normal development to an oncogenic stage. Multiple pathways such as cell growth control, apoptosis, senescence and DNA damage response contribute to cell transformation;1 however, the whole picture remains unclear. Human cancer stem cells share many characteristics with human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). It is possible that as normal human cells transform into an oncogenic stage, they share some similar mechanisms with the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) process. Besides OCT4, SOX2, MYC and KLF4, the major transcriptional factors that have a key role during the iPSC process,2, 3 other factors such as p53 family members and their downstream regulator, the miR-34 family, also affect the iPSC process either as an enhancer or inhibitor.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 As a member of the p53 family, the TP63 gene is transcribed from two alternative promoters: the N-terminal transactivation (TA) isoforms (including TAp63α, TAp63βand TAp63γ) and the isoforms lacking the TA domain (including ΔNp63α, ΔNp63β and ΔNp63γ). Interestingly, although p63 shares many functions with p53 in the DNA damage response, senescence, apoptosis and metastasis inhibition,13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 p63 has many different functions from p53.20 Humans heterozygous for a p53 mutation develop a variety of cancers at early ages,13, 21 while humans carrying a mutation in one allele of p63 do not develop cancer at high rates although p63 has an essential role in epithelia development.13, 22, 23 Also, p63 inhibits miR-34a, which is a tumor suppressor,24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 that is different from p53 that stimulates miR-34a expression.30, 31, 32, 33 In addition, p63 has an opposite role in maintaining stem cell characteristics.7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 34, 35, 36 However, the controversial effects of p63 on tumor development at this time are poorly elucidated.

To study whether the effects of the iPSC factors contribute to human cell oncogenic transformation, and if and how the factors affect cell transformation, we examined the expression levels of the key iPSC reprogramming factors, OCT4, SOX2, MYC and KLF4, and the inhibitors of iPSC, the miR-34 family (including miR-34a, miR-34b and miR-34c),5 as well as p53, the positive regulator of miR-34a,31, 32, 33 and p63, the negative regulator of miR34a,30 in heavy particle ionizing radiation (IR)-transformed human epithelial cells from different tissues (lung, breast and colon). The purpose of choosing IR-transformed cells is based on the following facts: (1) IR is a weaker carcinogenic factor when compared with the viral or chemical factors that immediately inhibit some key tumor suppressors or stimulate some key oncogenes, yet it enhances the background of spontaneous cancer frequency for almost all types of tumors.37 (2) Heavy particle IR is more efficient than X- or γ-ray (low linear energy transfer IR) in transforming cells, especially at low doses.38 By studying these IR-transformed cells, we revealed a novel functional link among p53 or p63 and miR-34a to target OCT4, as well as OCT4 feedback to target p53 or p63 with different consequences, which significantly affects cell transformation. We believe that such information will provide new insights into both cancer prevention and the iPSC process.

Results

Transformed human epithelial cells showed upregulated OCT4 and p63 but downregulated p53 and miR-34a

To explore the functional link between stem cell factors and p63 or p53, we examined the mRNA levels of four stem cell factors: OCT4, SOX2, MYC and KLF4, as well as the inhibitor of iPSC, the miR-34 family (including miR-34a, miR-34b, miR-34c), and the positive or negative regulator of miR-34a, p53 or p63, in four controls (non-transformed) and eight IR-transformed human cell lines derived from different tissues (lung, breast and colon) (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S1). In contrast to non-transformed cells, these different transformed human cell lines showed varied levels of SOX2 (barely detected in all measured cell lines, with the cycle threshold (CT) values>32), MYC, KLF4 and miR-34b, miR-34c (Supplementary Figure S1d). However, all the transformed cells showed higher levels of OCT4 (the major functional form, see the discussion section) and p63 and lower levels of p53 and miR-34a (Figure 1, Supplementary Figures S1b–d). The increased levels of p63 in these tested cells were only amplified with the primers that recognize TAp63 but not ΔNp63 (Supplementary Table S2), and the p63 protein signals with the antibody recognizing all isoforms of p63 showed single band in these tested cells (Supplementary Figures S1b and c), which excludes the presence of ΔNp63 isoforms. Based on the size of the p63 signals (Supplementary Figure 1b), we believe that the upregulated p63 in the transformed cells is TAp63α. The changes in the level of these factors: p53, p63, OCT4 and miR-34a in these transformed human epithelial cell lines suggest that there might be some functional links among these factors. We were interested in exploring whether there were any functional links among these factors, and if the functional links exist, whether they affected cell oncogenic transformation.

OCT4 is a target of miR-34a-3p

It has been reported that miR-34a directly targets other iPSC factors in mouse cells: SOX2, MYC and NANOG, but OCT4 is excluded,5 which is likely due to the absence of an optimal miR-34a-5p (the guide strand) binding sites at the 3′untranslated region (UTR) of OCT4. However, we found a miR-34a-3p (the passenger strand or miR-34a*) matched sequence at the 3′UTR (277 nucleotides (Nts)) of human OCT4 (Figure 2a) and showed that miR-34a-3p has a similar expression level to miR-34a-5p in all cell lines examined (Figure 2b). The complementary characteristics of two strands (5p and 3p) of a miRNA determine the different mRNAs that the 5p and 3p strands of the miRNA could target. Our results suggest that both strands of miR-34a are functional and that miR-34a-3p also has an equally important role to miR-34a-5p in regulating its targets. To examine whether miR-34a-3p targets OCT4, we designed two constructs with different primers (Supplementary Table S2): one plasmid encoding HA fused to OCT4 without 3′UTR (HA-OCT4d3′UTR) and the other plasmid encoding HA fused to OCT4 with 3′UTR (HA-OCT4-3′UTR) (Figure 2c). HA-OCT4 expression was similar in 293FT cells regardless of the presence or absence of the OCT4 3′UTR: the levels were highest at 24 h, decreased at 48 h, and reached the lowest level at 72 h after transfection (Supplementary Figure S2a). Alternatively, the miR-34a-3p levels increased significantly at 24 h and maintained similar levels until 72 h after transfection of miR-34a plasmid (Supplementary Figure S2b). Based on these results, we chose the 48-h post-transfection time point to examine the effects of miR-34a-3p on the HA-OCT4 levels in 293FT cells. At this time point, miR-34a-3p had no effect on the expression of OCT4 without the 3′UTR but significantly inhibited the expression of OCT4 with the 3′UTR (Figure 2d). Using a similar approach, we examined the effects of miR-34a-3p on the expression of OCT4 with a mutated 3′UTR (HA-OCT4-M3′UTR, deleted the binding site for miR-34a-3p). MiR-34a-3p failed to inhibit OCT4 expression in cells with the mutated 3′UTR (Figure 2e), indicating that the deletion in the OCT4 3′UTR is the binding site of miR-34a-3p.

To verify that OCT4 is a direct target of miR-34a-3p, we constructed luciferase reporters that contain the OCT4 wild-type (WT) or mutated 3′UTR (deleted the key binding site of miR-34a-3p). The OCT4 WT 3′UTR could be repressed by exogenous expression of miR-34a in 293FT cells (Figure 2f); however, the OCT4 mutated 3′UTR significantly compromised the miR-34a-3p-dependent inhibition (Figure 2f). These results confirm that miR-34a-3p directly targets OCT4 through its binding site. To further verify the target relationship between miR-34a-3p and OCT4, we examined the effects of miR-34a upregulation on human epithelial cells, LE1, and their transformed counterpart cells, LET1-1 (Supplementary Table S1). When compared with the control RNA, miR-34a-3p mimics downregulated OCT4 expression (Supplementary Figure S2c). These results provide additional evidence to support that OCT4 is a direct target of miR-34a-3p.

OCT4 is suppressed by miR-34a-3p in hESCs

To test whether the target relationship of miR-34a-3p and OCT4 existed in stem cells, we examined the effects of upregulating miR-34a on a hESC line, H9 cells. H9 cells have a significantly higher level of OCT4 compared with transformed human epithelial cells as detected by immunoblots. When compared with the control RNA transfection, the miR-34a mimics transfection resulted in increased levels of miR-34a-3p (Figure 3a) and decreased levels of OCT4 in H9 cells (Figure 3b). Notably, the decreased OCT4 expression in H9 cells induced by miR-34a upregulation occurred before cell differentiation as the stem cell marker, SSEA4, was clearly observed (Figure 3c). Similar results were observed in mouse embryonic stem cells (Supplementary Figure S3). These results exclude the possibility that miR-34a targeted other stem cell factors to promote stem cell differentiation that results in the reduced OCT4. These results also provide strong evidence that the miR-34 upregulation that resulted in stem cell differentiation5 is partially due to the downregulation of OCT4 by miR-34a-3p.

OCT4 stimulates p63 but inhibits p53 expression

It has been reported that p53 and p63 have opposite regulatory effects on miR-34a expression. We next tested whether OCT4 has any effect on p53 or p63 expression by observing the level of p53 or p63 in human epithelial cell lines, LE1 and LET1-1 (Supplementary Table S1), in which OCT4 was knocked down. Knocking down OCT4 with siRNA increased the protein levels of p53 and p21 (a downstream target of p53) but decreased p63 levels in these cells (Supplementary Figure S4a). On the other hand, p53 levels decreased but p63 levels increased when OCT4 was overexpressed in 293FT cells (Figures 4a and b, Supplementary Figure S4b). Furthermore, the real time PCR results with the primers specifically recognizing Tap63α, Tap63βor Tap63γ (Supplementary Figure S2) showed that the increased p63 levels in the OCT4 upregulated cells were mainly the Tap63α form (Supplementary Figure S4c). These results provide important evidence supporting that OCT4 promotes p63 (Tap63α) but inhibits p53 expression.

To investigate how OCT4 upregulates p63 expression, we searched the promoter region of p63 based on the reported OCT4 binding site for stimulating expression as described in previous publications.39, 40 We found three potential sites in the p63 promoter region (from −4044 to −4037, from −3044 to −3037 and from −2630 to −2623) that are similar to the consensus OCT4 binding sequence: ATG(C/A)(A/T)(A/T)(A/G)(T/C). We then compared the binding efficiencies of OCT4 to these sites using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as previously described41 with some modifications. We generated a new construct as a negative control by replacing the START codon of OCT4 (ATG) with the STOP codon (TAA) in the HA-OCT4 plasmid, which completely abolished the HA-OCT4 expression in whole-cell lysates (Supplementary Figure S5b) and in the nuclear extracts (Figure 4c). The biotin-p63 probe spanning site 2 (Supplementary Figure S5a) produced a substantial shift in the nuclear extract of 293FT cells overexpressing HA-OCT4 (Figure 4d). This shift signal was much lower in the nuclear extracts of 293FT cells without OCT4 expression (Figure 4d). Furthermore, the rabbit serum against HA, but not the rabbit non-specific serum, disrupted the shift band (Figure 4d), suggesting the specificity of the interaction. Finally, the addition of cold competitor probes of p63 site 2 (without a biotin label) also abolished the shift band (Figure 4d). Thus, the EMSA data suggest that the promoter region site 2 of p63 (Supplementary Figure S5a) is a specific OCT4 binding site. We made constructs with or without the potential OCT4 binding sequence from the promoter region of p63 (Supplementary Figure S5a) and examined the effects of the potential binding sequence on the transcriptional activity of p63 using a luciferase promoter assay. When co-transfected with an OCT4 expression plasmid (Supplementary Figure S5a), the luciferase reporter (∼1.8 kb) containing site 2, showed dramatically increased activity as compared with the reporters (∼1.8 kb) containing site 1 or 3 (Supplementary Figure S5a) or co-transfected with an OCT4-nonexpression plasmid (the START codon-replaced vector) (Supplementary Figure 5b, Figure 4e). These results confirm that site 2 (ATGAATGT) at the promoter region of p63 is the key sequence for p63 transcription activation by OCT4. In addition, the data from the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using 293FT (with or without overexpressed HA-OCT4) or H9 cells further support that OCT4 could directly bind to the specific region of the p63 promoter (Figure 4h).

Using a similar approach, we examined how OCT4 inhibited p53 expression. Based on what is known about the negative regulation site of OCT4,42 we performed the motif search at the promoter region of p53 and found two potential OCT4 negative regulation binding sites (from −1719 to −1710 and from −508 to−499) (Supplementary Figure S5c). A biotin-p53 probe, spanning site 1, produced a significant shift band with the nuclear extract from 293FT cells overexpressing OCT4 (Figure 4f). This shift band signal was less significant in the extracts from 293FT cells without OCT4 expression (Figure 4f). Furthermore, the rabbit serum against HA (for binding to HA-OCT4), but not the rabbit non-specific serum, disrupted the shift band (Figure 4f), which suggests the specificity of the interaction. Finally, the addition of cold competitor probes for the p53 site 1 abolished the shift band (Figure 4f). Thus, the EMSA suggested that the promoter of p53 contains a specific OCT4 repressor binding site. Next, we made the constructs with or without the potential OCT4 repressor binding sites from the promoter region of p53 (Supplementary Figure S5c) and examined the specific binding sequence on the transcriptional activity of p53 using a luciferase promoter assay. The results showed that the expressed OCT4 significantly suppressed the activity of the luciferase reporter containing sites 1 and 2 of p53 promoter (∼1.2 kb), WT (Figure 4g, Supplementary Figure S5c). In addition, the expressed OCT4 could not suppress the activity of the mutant reporter deleted site 1 (M1) (∼1.2 kb) but could still suppress the activity of the mutant reporter deleted site 2 (M2) (∼1.2 kb) (Figure 4g, Supplementary Figure 5c). These results confirm that site 1 (TGAGAAATCG) at the promoter region of p53 is the key sequence for p53 suppression by OCT4. Furthermore, the data from the ChIP assay using 293FT cells (with or without overexpressed HA-OCT4) or H9 cells further support that OCT4 could directly bind to the specific region of the p53 promoter (Figure 4h).

Upregulating miR-34a or downregulating OCT4 or p63 diminishes the transforming characteristics of human epithelial cells

It is known that upregulation of miR-34a stimulates iPSC differentiation5 and miR-34a is a tumor suppressor.24, 25, 27, 28, 29 When combining this information with our results, we were interested in testing whether upregulating miR-34a or downregulating OCT4 or p63 could suppress oncogenic transformation. For this purpose, we generated cell lines with stably knocked down OCT4 or p63 by using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression plasmids in the LET1-1 and LET1-2 cells (Supplementary Table S1). These cells transformed by IR were derived from non-transformed LE1 cells (Supplementary Table S1) that were immortalized by Cdk4 and hTERT without involving a viral oncogene or chemical reagent and had normal p53 expression and function.43 As a control, we simultaneously generated cell lines that stably silence p53 in these cells. All of the generated cell lines had clear GFP signals (Supplementary Figure S6a), indicating that the transfection of the GFP encoding plasmid was successful. The miR-34a levels showed significantly increased expression in the cells transfected with the miR-34a plasmid (Figure 5a). The p53, p63 or OCT4 levels were significantly reduced in the cells transfected with p53-shRNA, p63-shRNA or OCT4-shRNA (Figure 5b). Notably, upon p53 knockdown, the miR-34a level decreased (Supplementary Figure S6b), resulting in increased OCT4 levels (Figure 5b). On the other hand, upon p63 knockdown, miR-34a levels increased (Supplementary Figure S6b) but OCT4 levels decreased (Figure 5b). Most importantly, downregulating OCT4 or p63, or upregulating miR-34a dramatically decreased the soft agar colony-forming ability when compared with the vector-alone transfected cells (Figure 5c). As a control, downregulating p53 dramatically increased the soft agar colony-forming ability (Figure 5c). These results demonstrate that two functional loops exist in cells: p53 promotes miR-34a expression that targets OCT4 and OCT4, in turn, inhibits p53 expression; p63 inhibits miR-34a expression that targets OCT4 and OCT4, in turn, stimulates p63 expression (Figure 5d). Thus, in a similar way, the stem cell-related factors affect oncogenic cell transformation.

Discussion

In this study, we found a new function of the human OCT4 in promoting epithelial cell transformation. The human genome contains various OCT4 genes:44 the OCT4 gene located on chromosome 6p21.3 and several pseudogenes located on other chromosomes. The OCT4 signals that we measured are the active transcript form of OCT4 that includes the OCT4 gene and pseudogene 1. Pseudogene 1 is located on chromosome 8 and has 95% homology with the OCT4 gene and overexpressed in certain types of human tumors.45, 46 To determine whether the OCT4 signals that we detected (by real time PCR and western blot) in human epithelial cells were the OCT4 gene or OCT4 pseudogene 1, we used the specific primers as described previously.45 The results showed that there were some levels of OCT4 pseudogene 1 in both human stem cells (∼1% of the OCT4 gene) and epithelial cells (∼20% of the OCT4 gene). However, there was no difference in the levels of OCT4 pseudogene 1 between non-transformed and transformed cells. The increased OCT4 levels in transformed epithelial cells were mainly the OCT4 gene, although the levels of the OCT4 gene in human stem cells were significantly higher (with the CT of 20–22) than in the human epithelial cell lines (with the CT of 26–28). These results confirmed that changes in the OCT4 levels in the human epithelial cells are the real OCT4 form and not its pseudogenes. OCT4 is one of the important factors in iPSC reprogramming. In this study, we report that OCT4 contributes to human cell oncogenic transformation, although these data await further confirmation in in vivo models, they strongly support the role of OCT4 in promoting tumor-initiation47 and suggest the shared function of OCT4 in the two processes.

p63, as a member of the p53 family, has been challenging to dissect, particularly owing to its three isoforms, including its N-terminal truncated form (ΔNp63).48, 49 We reported in this study that the main p63 protein (TAp63α), but not its other isoforms, cooperates with OCT4 to contribute to cell transformation. The sequence (ATGAATGT) that could be bound by OCT4 in the promoter of TAp63 as shown in this study also exists in the upstream (1487 nt and 931 nt) of the ΔNp63 transcription start site ( GAGAGAGAA). However, while the signals of TAp63 clearly increased, no signal of ΔNp63 changed using the approach of real-time PCR (with the specific primers as shown in Supplementary Table S2), indicating that the potential OCT4 binding sites in the promoter of ΔNp63 could not be efficiently bound by OCT4 in 293FT cells. Whether OCT4 has any promoting role for ΔNp63 in human tumor cells needs to be elucidated in the future studies. Our results support that OCT4 inhibits p53 but stimulates p63 (as described in this study), which provides an additional regulation of p63, which helps to explain a role of p63 in stimulating tumor development.22, 23, 50, 51, 52 It seems that p63 has different roles1, 12, 39, 42 at different stages of tumor development: p63 stimulates cell transformation at the initial stage of tumor development22, 23, 50, 51, 52 but inhibits metastasis at a later stage of tumor development. DNA damage-induced p53 and p63 affect the expression of miR-34a, which further affects OCT4 expression and depends on the balance of p53 and p63 as well as their co-factors. Our results also suggest that if the p53 pathway over the p63 pathway has a major role, the repaired cells might maintain their normal status; on the other hand, if the p63 pathway over the p53 pathway has a major role, the repaired cells might gain the potential to develop into a transformation status. Such a prediction should be tested with further experiments.

In summary, p53 and p63 have opposite effects on human cell transformation by regulating miR-34a/OCT4 and, in turn, are affected by OCT4. Our results detail the functional relationships among these factors and demonstrate that the balance of two functional loops, p53-miR-34a-OCT4-p53 and p63-miR-34a-OCT4-p63, are decisive in cell transformation. These results provide strong evidence for the similarity between iPSC and oncogenic cell transformation. Therefore, understanding the two functional loops, p53-miR-34a-OCT4-p53 and p63-miR-34a-OCT4-p63, will benefit both cancer prevention and iPSC reprogramming.

RNA isolation, RT-PCR and real-time PCR analyses

Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) and its concentration was determined using NanoDrop (Wilmington, DE, USA). cDNA was synthesized using 500 ng of total RNA from each sample in a 20-μl reverse transcriptase reaction mixture from QuantiTect (Qiagen Inc.). The mRNA levels of OCT4, SOX2, c-MYC, KLF4, p53 or p63 in different samples were measured with the custom-designed microarrays with incorporated primers (GAPDH was used as the internal control) from SABioscience, a Qiagen Company, by real-time PCR with a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System, Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY, USA). In addition, the levels of OCT4, p53 and p63 (TAp63 or ΔNp63, the primer information is described in Supplementary Table S2) as well as the levels of the mature or pri-miR-34 family were measured with TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA) or Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Invitrogen Life Technology, Grand Island, NY, USA) by real-time PCR with a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. The RT-PCR products were analyzed using eletrophoresis. The expression levels were normalized to GAPDH (for mRNA) or RNU48 (for miRNA).

Cell transfection

pEZX-MR03-miR-34a was purchased from GeneCopoeia Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA) Human transformed cell lines and 293FT cells were transfected with plasmid or small RNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. H9 cells or mouse embryo stem cells were transfected with miR-34a mimic (miRIDIAN) or control RNA (Dharmacon RNAi Technologies, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) using a nucloefection kit (Amaxa, Invitrogen Life Technology) and program B030 according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Immunoblots

At different times after transfection (vector or miRNA mimic), whole-cell lysates were subjected to western blotting analyses. Antibodies against human OCT4 (sc-8628), p53 (sc-126), p63 (sc-8343), p21 (sc-397), PCNA (sc-7907), HA (sc-805) and Actin (sc-47778) used in the western blotting were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc (Dallas, TX, USA). Antibody against SOX2 (AB5603) used in the western blotting were purchased from Millipore Inc (Billerica, MA, USA).

EMSA

Nuclear extracts from 293FT cells with or without HA-OCT4 expression were prepared using an NE-PER Kit (Thermo Scientific, Atlanta, GA, USA) following the manufacturer's directions. The DNA probes (the sequence information are described in Supplementary Table S3) generated by annealing biotin-labeled oligos were purchased from IDT (San Jose, CA, USA). The DNA binding reaction, including biotinprobes (50 pmol), nuclear extracts (7 μg), 1.0 μl Poly d(I-C) (1 μg/μl) in binding buffer with or without competitor probes (20 × molar excess), was mixed and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The reaction was added with 1.0 μl of TF Probe (total volume was 10 μl) and then incubated at 15 °C for 30 min in a thermal cycler. To perform supershift, anti-HA-OCT4 antibody or non-specific anti-serum (2 μl) was added to the reaction and incubated for another 20 min. The DNA–protein complexes were resolved on a 0.5X TBE gel, 120V at 4 °C for 50 min and then transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA). After UV fixation, the membrane was blocked with the blocking buffer (Panomics, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for 15 min at room temperature. Biotin probes were detected with HRP-labeled Streptavidin (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), followed by washing three times with the wash buffer. The membranes were exposed using Hyblot (Metuchen, NJ, USA) CL premium autoradiography film.

Luciferase assays

The human OCT4 3′UTR containing one miR-34a-binding site, p53 or p63 5′UTR containing the potential OCT4 binding sites was cloned into the psiCHECK-2 Vector (Promega) added with SpeI digestion site and with proper primers as described in Supplementary Table S2. Mutagenesis of the binding sites within these 3′UTR or 5′UTR fragments was carried out using the primers as described in (Supplementary Table S2). WT, mutated 3′UTR or 5′UTR constructs were each cloned downstream of a firefly luciferase (Luc) reporter. Each Luc construct (100 ng) was transfected into 293FT cells together with a Renilla luciferase construct (10 ng) as a normalization control and 50 nM control RNA or miR-34a mimics (for the 3′UTR experiments) and an empty vector (100 ng) or the vector encoding OCT4 (for the 5′UTR experiments), respectively. The firefly and Renilla luciferase activity of each transfection was determined by a dual luciferase assay (Promega) 48 or 72 h post transfection.

ChIP assay

The ChIP assay was performed using 293FT cells that were transfected with either the HA control vector or the HA-OCT4 vector as described above (see section ‘Plasmid constructs') or H9 with a Piece Agarose Kit purchased from Thermo Inc. according to the manufacturer's instructions. A HA antibody (for 293FT cells) or an OCT4 antibody (for H9 cells) was used to immunoprecipitate the cross-linked mixture including the protein and Nt. The primers for the p53 promoter or the p63 promoter are as described in Supplementary Table S2.

Immunocytochemistry

Human or mouse embryo stem cells were grown on BD matrigel-coated coverslips (Fisher Scientific, Atlanta, GA, USA), fixed by 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells on the coverslide were incubated with the primary SSEA-4 antibody for human cells or SSEA-1 for mouse cells (Stem Cell Technologies). The primary antibody was detected using species-specific fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA).

Cell transformation

Cell transformation was measured by using a soft agar colony forming assay as described previously.54 LET1-1 or LET1-2 cells were stably expressed with control plasmid, plasmid encoding GFP-fused miR-34a (GeneCopoeia Inc.), shRNA of p53 (obtained from Dr. Trono's lab55), shRNA of p63 or shRNA of OCT4 (OriGene, Rockville, MD, USA). Briefly, 4% low melting temperature agarose and 1 × complete medium were mixed to obtain a 0.5% agarose concentration, then 2 ml of 0.5% agarose–complete medium mixture was added to each well in six-well plates, and the agar was solidified at 4 °C. These plates were kept in the incubator until the next day. Cells were harvested and mixed (500, 1000, 1500 cells per well) with tissue culture medium containing 0.7% agar to a final agar concentration of 0.35%. Then 2 ml of the cell suspension were immediately plated in six-well plates coated with 2 ml of 0.5% agar in tissue culture medium per well (in triplicate), and the cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO  for 3 weeks. The culture was stained with 0.2% p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and scanned for colony counting, and colonies >100 μm in diameter were counted.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis of data was done using the Student's t-test. Differences with p<0.05 are considered significant.
