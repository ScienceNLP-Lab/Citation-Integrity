Cyclin D-CDK4 kinase destabilizes PD-L1 via Cul3 SPOP  to control cancer immune surveillance

SUMMARY

Targeting immune checkpoints such as the one mediated by programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 have been approved for treating human cancers with durable clinical benefit 1,2. However, many cancer patients fail to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, and the underlying mechanism(s) is not well understood 3–5. Recent studies revealed that response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade might correlate with PD-L1 expression levels in tumor cells 6,7. Hence, it is important to mechanistically understand the pathways controlling PD-L1 protein expression and stability, which can offer a molecular basis to improve the clinical response rate and efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in cancer patients. Here, we report that PD-L1 protein abundance is regulated by cyclin D-CDK4 and the Cullin 3SPOP E3 ligase via proteasome-mediated degradation. Inhibition of CDK4/6 in vivo elevates PD-L1 protein levels largely through inhibiting cyclin D-CDK4-mediated phosphorylation of SPOP, thereby promoting SPOP degradation by APC/CCdh1. Loss-of-function mutations in SPOP compromise ubiquitination-mediated PD-L1 degradation, leading to increased PD-L1 levels and reduced numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in mouse tumors and in primary human prostate cancer specimens. Notably, combining CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy enhances tumor regression and dramatically improves overall survival rates in mouse tumor models. Our study uncovers a novel molecular mechanism for regulating PD-L1 protein stability by a cell cycle kinase and reveals the potential for using combination treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors and PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade to enhance therapeutic efficacy for human cancers.

Deregulated cell cycle progression is a hallmark of human cancer, and targeting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) to block cell proliferation has been validated as an effective anti-cancer therapy 8. Although it has been reported that PD-L1 expression can be regulated at both transcriptional 9,10 and post-translational levels 11,12, it remains unclear whether PD-L1 stability is regulated under physiological conditions such as during cell cycle progression. We found that PD-L1 protein abundance fluctuated during cell cycle in multiple human cancer cell lines, peaking in M/early G1 phases, followed by a sharp reduction in late G1/S phases (Fig. 1a–d; Extended Data Fig. 1a–g). Elevated PD-L1 protein abundance was also observed in multiple mouse tumor-derived cell lines arrested in M phase by nocodazole or taxol 13 (Extended Data Fig. 1h–m).

Cyclin-dependent kinases play crucial roles in regulating the stability of cell cycle-related proteins during cell cycle progression 14,15. Therefore, we adopted a genetic method to ablate each major cyclin and found that ablating all three D-type cyclins (D1, D2 and D3), but not cyclin A (A1 and A2) nor cyclin E (E1 and E2), strongly elevated PD-L1 protein abundance in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a–e). Using MEFs lacking individual D-type cyclins, we observed that depletion of cyclin D1, and to a lesser extent cyclin D2 or D3, upregulated PD-L1 protein levels (Fig. 2b, c). Conversely, reintroduction of cyclin D1, and to a lesser extent cyclin D2 or D3, suppressed PD-L1 protein abundance in cyclin D1−/−D2−/−D3−/− MEFs (Extended Data Fig. 2f). In further support of a physiological role for cyclin D1 in negatively regulating PD-L1 protein level in vivo, mammary tumors arising in cyclin D1−/− MMTV-Wnt-1 or MMTV-c-Myc mice displayed elevated PD-L1 protein levels, as compared to tumors arising in cyclin D1+/+ animals (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2g).

Depletion of cyclin D catalytic partner, the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) 16, but not CDK6 16 nor the cyclin A and cyclin E binding-partner, CDK2 17, also increased PD-L1 protein abundance in cells (Fig. 2e, f; Extended Data Fig. 2h–j). Conversely, ectopic expression of wild-type CDK4, but not kinase-dead N158F mutant, decreased PD-L1 levels (Extended Data Fig. 2k, l). Furthermore, treatment of multiple cancer cell lines with two different selective inhibitors of CDK4/6 kinase, palbociclib or ribociclib 8, upregulated PD-L1 protein abundance and stability even in pRB knock-down cells (Fig. 2g, h; Extended Data Fig. 2m–q).

Rb is frequently inactivated in human cancers 18,19. In agreement with previous reports 20,21, we found that Rb-deficient cancer cells often displayed high levels of cyclin D-CDK4/6 inhibitor, p16INK4a. Consistent with the notion that cyclin D1-CDK4 kinase suppresses PD-L1 levels, we observed that upregulation of 16INK4 correlated with elevated PD-L1 levels. Moreover, in Rb-proficient/p16-low cancer cell lines, higher PD-L1 levels correlated with relatively low CDK4 expression (Extended Data Fig. 2r). In addition, ectopic expression of p16INK4 in Rb-proficient/p16-low cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) or Rb-deficient/p16-low cell line (HLF) elevated PD-L1 protein abundance (Extended Data Fig. 2s–u), while depletion of p16INK4 in Rb-deficient/p16-high cell lines (MDA-MB-436, BT549, and HCC1937) had an opposite effect (Extended Data Fig. 2v–x), further documenting an inverse correlation between the CDK4 activity and PD-L1 expression.

To extend these observations to an in vivo setting, we treated MMTV-ErbB2 mice bearing autochthonous breast cancers, or mice carrying allografts of murine MC38 or B16-F10 cancer cell lines with palbociclib, and monitored PD-L1 levels. Inhibition to CDK4/6 led a significant upregulation of PD-L1 in all these cancer models, which was accompanied by a reduction in the number of infiltrating CD3+ TILs (Fig. 2i–k; Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). We also observed that palbociclib treatment significantly elevated PD-L1 protein levels in various organs of normal mice (Extended Data Fig. 3d–h). Collectively, these results demonstrate that cyclin D-CDK4 kinase plays a rate-limiting role in regulating PD-L1 levels in vivo.

To understand how cyclin D-CDK4 regulates PD-L1 levels, we first determined that treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitor MG132, or with cullin-based ubiquitin E3 ligase inhibitor, MLN4924 22 elevated PD-L1 protein levels (Fig. 3a). To identify which cullin family E3 ligase(s) regulates PD-L1, we screened the potential interaction of PD-L1 with each cullin family proteins and found that Cullin 3, and to a lesser extent, Cullin 1 interacted with PD-L1 in cells (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). These results indicate that in addition to Cullin 1/β-TRCP 11, Cullin 3-based E3 ligase(s) might play a role in regulating PD-L1 stability. Consistent with this notion, depletion of Cullin 3 elevated the protein abundance of endogenous PD-L1 (Extended Data Fig. 4c).

Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin ligases recognize their downstream substrates through substrate-recruiting adaptor proteins 23. We found that SPOP, but not other adaptor proteins examined interacted with PD-L1 in cells (Fig. 3c, d). We further determined that deletion of the C-tail, or the last eight amino acids of PD-L1 (283-290), disrupted binding of PD-L1 to SPOP, and rendered PD-L1 resistant to SPOP-meditated poly-ubiquitination (Extended Data Fig. 4d–h), indicating that the 283-290 region of PD-L1 might represent the potential binding motif for SPOP. Importantly, the cancer-derived PD-L1 T290M mutant (cBioPortal) located within the SPOP-binding motif also lost its ability to interact with SPOP and became more stable through decreased SPOP-mediated poly-ubiquitination and degradation (Extended Data Fig. 4i–l). Furthermore, depleting SPOP or deleting its substrate-interacting MATH domain elevated and stabilized PD-L1 in cells (Fig. 3e, f; Extended Data Fig. 5a–m). However, depleting known SPOP substrates including AR, ERG, Trim24, or DEK in SPOP-WT or SPOP−/− cells did not lead to obvious changes in PD-L1 levels (Extended Data Fig. 5n–u), arguing against a possibility of secondary effects for the observed elevation of PD-L1 upon SPOP depletion.

SPOP mutations occur in 10–15% of human prostate cancers, and are largely clustered within the MATH domain 24,25 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Notably, these cancer-derived SPOP mutants failed to promote PD-L1 degradation due to their deficiency in binding to PD-L1 and promoting PD-L1 poly-ubiquitination (Fig. 3g–i and Extended Data Fig. 6b, c), which resembles the Elongin C-encoding TCEB1 hotspot mutants in clear cell renal carcinoma, resulting in deficiencies in the ability of Cullin 2/Elongin B/C/VHL E3 ligase complex to promote HIF1α degradation 26. We also observed that mutations in the PD-L1 C-tail (degron) are mutually exclusive with mutations in the substrate-interacting MATH domain of SPOP (Extended Data Fig. 6d, e).

To further explore the impact of SPOP mutations on tumorigenesis, we generated tumor cell lines expressing SPOP-WT or cancer-derived mutants. We found that cells expressing cancer-derived SPOP mutants displayed elevated levels of endogenous PD-L1 protein, as compared to cells expressing SPOP-WT. (Fig. 3j and Extended Data Fig. 6f–j). Upon inoculation into immunoproficient mice, the growth of implanted tumors expressing cancer-derived SPOP-F102C was faster than tumors expressing SPOP-WT (Fig. 3k and Extended Data Fig. 6k). Tumors expressing cancer-derived SPOP-F102C mutant displayed elevated PD-L1 levels and significantly reduced numbers of CD3+ TIL (Fig 3l and Extended Data Fig. 6l). Strikingly, the difference in tumor weights between SPOP-WT and SPOP-F102C groups was largely alleviated after treatment with anti-PD-L1 antibody (Extended Data Fig. 6m–p), or when tumor cells were inoculated into T cell-deficient Tcrα−/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 6q–s). Hence, enhanced tumorigenic potential of SPOP-mutant cells is largely caused by elevated PD-L1 levels resulting in increased immune evasion.

We next explored whether loss-of-function SPOP mutations regulate PD-L1 levels or TILs in primary human prostate cancers. To this end, we identified 15 SPOP-mutant and 82 SPOP-wild type tumors through large-scale sequencing as described 27,28. IHC staining results revealed that approximately 80% of SPOP-mutant tumors exhibited strong PD-L1 staining, while only approximately 10% of SPOP-WT tumors exhibited strong staining for PD-L1 and 70% of SPOP-WT cases displayed weak or no PD-L1 staining (Fig. 3m, n; Extended Data Fig. 7a–d). Moreover, the numbers of CD8+ TILs were reduced in samples harboring SPOP mutations, as compared to SPOP-WT tumors (Fig. 3o; Extended Data Fig. 7e–h). These results indicate that SPOP-deficiency correlates with elevated PD-L1 protein abundance and decreased numbers of TILs in primary human prostate cancers.

We further found that SPOP protein abundance fluctuated during the cell cycle and displayed an inverse correlation with PD-L1 protein levels (Fig. 1a and Fig. 4a); depleting SPOP resulted in stabilization of PD-L1 across the cell cycle (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8a). We noted that the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) E3 ligase adaptor protein Cdh1 displayed an inverse correlation with SPOP protein levels during cell cycle (Fig. 1a, 1c and Fig. 4a). Furthermore, depletion of Cdh1, but not Cdc20, elevated SPOP protein abundance, which was accompanied by a simultaneous reduction in PD-L1 protein levels (Extended Data Fig. 8b, c). Consistent with these results, we detected a physical interaction between the endogenous SPOP and Cdh1 proteins (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 8d, e), and identified an evolutionarily conserved destruction-box motif (D-box: RxxLxxxxN) 29 in SPOP (Extended Data Fig. 8f). Deleting the D-box motif in SPOP disrupted its binding to Cdh1 and rendered SPOP resistant to Cdh1-mediated poly-ubiquitination and degradation (Fig. 4c, d; Extended Data Fig. 8g–i). Moreover, depletion of Cdh1 led to SPOP stabilization, which subsequently resulted in a reduction in PD-L1 protein level during cell cycle progression (Fig. 4e). Taken together, these results indicate that Cdh1 is a physiologically important upstream E3 ligase responsible for negatively regulating SPOP protein stability.

To elucidate how the cyclin D-CDK4 kinase affects this mechanism, we established that cyclin D1-CDK4 directly phosphorylates SPOP at Ser6, but not Ser222, the only two conserved serine-proline sites in SPOP (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 9a–d). Conversely, treatment of cells with CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, reduced the phosphorylation of SPOP in cells (Extended Data Fig. 9e). We observed that 14-3-3γ protein physically interacted with SPOP in a pSer6-dependent manner and disrupted the interaction of SPOP with Cdh1 in cells (Fig. 4g, h; Extended Data Fig. 9f–h). Inhibition of SPOP-pSer6 decreased the interaction of SPOP with 14-3-3γ and increased its binding to Cdh1, leading to elevated SPOP poly-ubiquitination (Fig. 4i; Extended Data Fig. 9i–p). Consequently, palbociclib treatment decreased SPOP protein abundance and elevated PD-L1 levels in SPOP-WT, but not SPOP-deficient cells (Fig. 4j). Moreover, depletion of 14-3-3γ dramatically upregulated PD-L1 levels and stabilized PD-L1 during cell cycle progression (Extended Data Fig. 9q–t).

Recent clinical studies revealed that the success of PD1/PD-L1 blockade correlates with PD-L1 expression levels in tumor cells 6,7. Given our observation that inhibition of CDK4/6 elevated PD-L1 levels, we hypothesized that inhibitors of CDK4/6 kinase might synergize with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy to elicit an enhanced therapeutic effect. Notably, we observed that treatment of immunoproficient mice bearing CT26 tumors with palbociclib plus anti-PD-1 antibody dramatically retarded tumor progression and resulted in 8 complete responses out of 12 treated mice (Fig. 4k; Extended Data Fig. 10a). Moreover, combining CDK4/6 inhibitor with anti-PD-1 therapy resulted in a significant improvement of overall survival compared to single-agent treated group (Fig. 4l). Similar results were obtained using mice bearing tumors derived from MC38 cells. (Extended Data Fig. 10b, c). As expected from our earlier observations, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with palbociclib decreased the absolute numbers of TILs, including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, Granzyme B+ and IFNγ+ cells. Importantly, addition of anti-PD-1 antibody to palbociclib treatment restored essentially normal numbers of TILs (Extended Data Fig. 10d–j).

A recent study revealed that another inhibitor of CDK4/6, abemaciclib, increased immunogenicity of cancer cells via an Rb-dependent mechanism, which activates tumor cell expression of endogenous retroviral elements, thereby stimulating production of type III interferons and antigen presentation by tumor cells 30. Together with our demonstration that cyclin D-CDK4 regulates PD-L1 stability through Cullin 3SPOP (Extended Data Fig. 10k), these studies provide complementary molecular rationale for combining CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy to enhance tumor regression.

Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analyses

Cells were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (phosphatase inhibitor cocktail set I and II, Calbiochem). Protein concentrations were measured by the Beckman Coulter DU-800 spectrophotometer using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for cell pellets, xenografted tumors or human prostate tumor specimens

The cultured cells (MDA-MB-231 PD-L1 WT and KO cells; HBP-ALL shScr and shCD8 cells; KE37 shScr and shCD8 cells) were washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes. Cells pellets or xenografted (MDA-MB-231 PD-L1 WT or KO) tumors were embedded into TFM and frozen. After cryostat sections (10 μM) were placed on Superfrost Plus Stain slides, samples were then permibilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 minutes. For IHC analysis, we used UltraSensitive™ SP (Mouse) IHC Kit (KIT-9701, Fuzhou Maixin Biotech) following the manufacturer’s instructions with minor modification. The sections were incubated with 3% H O  for 15 min at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidase activity. After incubating in normal goat serum for 1 hour to block non-specific binding of IgG, sections were treated with primary antibody (PD-L1, 298B.3G6, 18 μg/ml; CD8α, sc-53212, clone C8/144B, dilution 1:40) at 4°C overnight. Sections were then incubated for 30 minutes with biotinylated goat-anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Fuzhou Maixin Biotech), followed by incubation with streptavidin-conjugated HRP (Fuzhou Maixin Biotech). Specific samples were developed with 3′3-diaminobenzidine (DAB-2031, Fuzhou Maixin Biotech). Images were taken using an Olympus microscopic camera and matched software.

The prostate tumor specimens were obtained from Shanghai Changhai Hospital in China. Usage of these specimens was approved by the Institute Review Board of Shanghai Changhai Hospital. For IHC, the paraformaldehyde fixed paraffin embedded prostate tumor samples were deparaffinized in xylene (3 × 10 min), rehydrated through a series of graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 85%, and 75%) to water. Samples were then subjected to heat-mediated antigen retrieval at 95°C for 20 min. The following IHC steps were the same as described above.

The expression level of PD-L1 in prostate cancer tumor samples was determined according to the intensity of the staining as 0, negative; 1, weak expression; 2, intermediate expression and 3, strong expression. The numbers of intraepithelial CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) was counted as described in Hamanishi et al 37. Briefly, three independent areas with the most abundant infiltration were selected under a microscopic field at 200 × magnification (0.0625mm2). The number of intraepithelial CD8+ TILs was counted manually and calculated as cells per mm2. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the difference in PD-L1 expression between SPOP mutated and wide type cases. The Student’s t test was used to determine P values of the difference in CD8+ TILs between SPOP mutated and wide type cases. P < 0.05 was considered as significant.

In vitro cyclin D/CDK4 kinase assays

Kinase assays were performed in a final volume of 30 μl of a kinase buffer as described previously 38: 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl , 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM NaF, containing 10 μM ATP and 0.4 mCi [32P]γATP (Perkin Elmer). 0.2 μg of CDK4/cyclin D1 (0142-0143-1, Pro-Qinase), CDK4/cyclin D2 (0142-0375-1, Pro-Qinase), or CDK4/cyclin D3 (0142-0373-1, Pro-Qinase) were used as kinases. 2 μg of His-SPOP, His-SPOP-S6A, His-SPOP-S222A, or His-SPOP-S6A/S222A mutant proteins immobilized on Ni-NTA beads were used as kinase substrates. 0.1 μg of Rb1 C-terminal recombinant protein (Cat. SC-4112, Santa Cruz) was used as a positive control for kinase assays. 2 μg of BSA was used as a negative control. After 60 min incubation at 30°C, proteins were denatured, resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and exposed to X-ray films.

Kinase assay for Rb by immune-purified endogenous CDK4/cyclin D1 from mice tissues

For endogenous kinase assays, the endogenous CDK4 was immunoprecipitated by 6 μg of anti-CDK4 Ab (Santa Cruz, sc-23896 AC) from 2.5 mg of lysates (buffer: 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl , 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% NP40) of livers or brains isolated from C57BL6 mice. The association of cyclin D1 was also confirmed by cyclin D1 antibodies (abcam, ab134175).

Hoechst (life technology, 1:10,000) was used to stain nucleus. Tumor tissues were mounted with fluoromount-G® (SouthernBiotech) at 4°C overnight. Tissue sections were examined with fluorescent microscope under a 20 × objective lens. CD3+ cell numbers were counted in an area of 5.95 × 105 μm2.

Single cell generation from tumor tissue and flow cytometry analysis

Tumor tissues were minced and digested with 5 ml of 2 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma) in DMEM for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were then collected by centrifuge and filtered through a 70 μm strainer in DMEM. Cell pellets were suspended and lysed in red blood cell lysis buffer for 5 min. The cells were then filtered through a 40 μm strainer in 1 x PBS with 2% BSA. 1 million cells were incubated with antibodies against PD-L1 (564715, BD Biosciences, 1:100) conjugated with APC or antibodies against CD3 (Biolegend, 1:100) conjugated with APC or corresponding isotype IgG1 control at room temperature for 30 min.

In vivo experimental therapy in MC38 and CT26 mice tumor models

Animal studies were approved by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC; protocol number 04-047), and performed in accordance with guidelines established by NIH Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. MC38 or CT26 tumors were established by subcutaneously injecting 1 × 105 MC38 or CT26 tumor cells in 100 μl HBSS into the right flank of 6-week old C57BL/6 or BALB/c female mice (Jackson Lab, ME). Tumor sizes were measured every three days by caliper after implantation and tumor volume was calculated by length × width2 × 0.5. On day 7 after tumor cells were injected, animals were pooled and randomly divided into four groups with comparable average tumor size. Moreover, the lab members who measured the mice were blinded to the treatment groups. Mice were grouped into control antibody treatment, PD-1 mAb treatment, CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, and PD-1 mAb plus CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment. As illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 10a, control and PD-1 mAb treatments were conducted by intraperitoneal injection (200 μg/mouse in 200 μl HBSS saline buffer) every three days for a total of 8 injections. The CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment was given by oral gavage once a day with a dosage of 100 mg/kg for three weeks with a break every week for one day. For survival studies, animals were monitored for tumor volumes every three days for 120 days after initial treatment, until tumor volume exceeded 2000 mm3, or until tumor had ulcer with diameter reached 1 cm. Statistical analysis was conducted using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Kaplan-Meier curves and corresponding Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxo tests were used to evaluate the statistical differences between groups in survival studies. P < 0.05 was considered to be significant.

T cell analysis for MC38 implanted tumors

MC38 implanted tumors were established by subcutaneously injecting 1 × 105 of MC38 cells were injected into the right flank of 6 week old C57BL/6 female mice (Jackson Lab). On the day of the tumor cells injected, mice were randomly divided into four groups: control antibody treatment, PD-1 mAb treatment, CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, and PD-1 mAb plus CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment. Control and PD-1 mAb treatments were conducted by intraperitoneal injection (200 μg/mouse in 200 μl HBSS saline buffer) every three days for a total of 4 injections. The treatment of palbociclib was given by oral gavage with the dosage of 200 mg/kg for 9 days, with a break after 7 days. Tumors were then collected and single cell was generated from tumor tissues as described in section “Single Cell Generation from Tumor Tissue and Flow Cytometry analysis”. After cells were filtered through 40 μm strainer, cells were fixed in 0.5 ml/tube Fixation buffer (420801, Biolegend) in the dark for 20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then washed with 1 × PBS with 2% BSA. The fixed cells were suspended in Intracellular Staining Perm Wash Buffer (421002, Biolegend) after centrifuge for two times to permeabilize the cells. Cells were then co-stained with antibodies against CD3 (100236, APC conjugated, Biolegend), Granzyme B (515403, FITC conjugated, Biolegend), IFN-γ (505808, PE conjugated, Biolegend) to check the activities of T cells. Or cells were co-stained with antibodies against CD3 (100236, APC conjugated, Biolegend), CD4 (100510, FITC conjugated, Biolegend), CD8 (100708, PE conjugated, Biolegend). The corresponding isotype IgG1 controls were used for controls. The cells were incubated with corresponding antibodies for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed by 1 × PBS with 2% BSA and analyzed by flow cytometry.

  A schematic model that illustrates the treatment plan for mice bearing subcutaneous MC38 tumors. Female C57BL/6 mice were implanted with 0.1 × 106 MC38 cells subcutaneously and treated with four arms: control antibody treatment, anti-PD-1 mAb treatment, CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, anti-PD-1 mAb plus CDK4/6 inhibitor combination treatment.

  MC38 implanted tumor-bearing mice were enrolled in different treatment groups as indicated. Tumor volumes of mice treated with control antibody (n = 15), anti-PD-1 mAb (n = 15), the CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib (n = 14) or combined therapy (n = 12) were measured every three days and plotted individually. We repeated this experiment twice.

  Kaplan-Meier survival curves for each treatment group demonstrate the improved efficacy of combining PD-1 mAb with the CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib. *P < 0.05. (Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxo test). We repeated this experiment twice.

  The absolute number of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, Granzyme B+, or IFNγ+ TILs cells of implanted MC38 tumors treated with indicated agents was analyzed by FACS. Control: n = 8, palbociclib: n = 10, PD-1 Ab: n = 9, Palbociclib & PD-1 Ab: n = 8.

  The percentage of CD4+, CD8+ in CD3+ TILs cells of implanted MC38 tumors treated with indicated agents was analyzed by FACS. Control: n = 8, palbociclib: n = 10, PD-1 Ab: n = 9, Palbociclib & PD-1 Ab: n = 8.

  A proposed working model to illustrate how PD-L1 protein stability is regulated by the cyclin D/CDK4-SPOP-Cdh1 signaling pathway. The cyclin D/CDK4 negatively regulates PD-L1 protein stability largely through phosphorylating its upstream physiological E3 ligase SPOP to promote SPOP binding with 14-3-3γ, which subsequently disrupts Cdh1-mediated destruction of SPOP. As such, CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment could unexpectedly elevate PD-L1 protein levels largely through inhibiting cyclin D/CDK4-mediated phosphorylation of SPOP to promote its degradation by APC/CCdh1. The unexpected rise of PD-L1 could present a severe clinical problem for patients receiving CDK4 inhibitor treatment and could be one of the underlying mechanisms accounting for CDK4 inhibitor resistance via evading immune surveillance checkpoint. Hence, our work provides a novel molecular mechanism as well as the rationale for the combinational treatment of PD-L1 blockage treatment and the CDK4/6 inhibitors as a more efficient anti-cancer clinical option.
