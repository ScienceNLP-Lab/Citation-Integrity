Targeting colorectal cancer via its microenvironment by inhibiting IGF-1 Receptor-insulin receptor substrate and STAT3 signaling

Abstract

The tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical pro-tumorigenic effects through cytokines and growth factors that support cancer cell proliferation, survival, motility and invasion. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) stimulate colorectal cancer (CRC) development and progression via cell autonomous and microenvironmental effects. Using a unique inhibitor, NT157, which targets both IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and STAT3, we show that these pathways regulate many TME functions associated with sporadic colonic tumorigenesis in CPC-APC mice, in which cancer development is driven by loss of the Apc tumor suppressor gene. NT157 causes a substantial reduction in tumor burden by affecting cancer cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and myeloid cells. Decreased cancer cell proliferation and increased apoptosis were accompanied by inhibition of CAF activation and decreased inflammation. Furthermore, NT157 inhibited expression of pro-tumorigenic cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, including IL-6, IL-11 and IL-23 as well as CCL2, CCL5, CXCL7, CXCL5, ICAM1 and TGFβ; decreased cancer cell migratory activity and reduced their proliferation in the liver. NT157 represents a new class of anti-cancer drugs that affect both the malignant cell and its supportive microenvironment.

INTRODUCTION

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer, with approximately 1.2 million new cases each year. Improved early detection and patient stratification have resulted in a significant reduction of mortality, but most of the improvement has been limited to early stage CRC (stages I and II), and in patients with advanced stage III and IV disease, morbidity and mortality remain high1. CRC originates from epithelial cells at the base of intestinal crypts, which accumulate activating oncogenic mutations with concomitant loss of tumor suppressor genes, especially APC2. About 2–3% of all CRC cases are associated with pre-existing inflammation and are referred to as colitis associated cancer, or CAC3, whose development is highly dependent on NF-κB signaling in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), which leads to indirect activation of STAT3 in pre-malignant intestinal epithelial cells (IEC)4,5.

STAT3, a crucial and well-known mediator of malignant progression in CRC5,6, is predominantly activated by IL-65 and IL-117. Immune cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) within the TME actively contribute to sustained STAT3 activation in CRC. Secretion of IL-11 by TGF-β-stimulated CAF triggers STAT3 signaling in cancer cells8, and IL-6 produced by TAM protects normal and premalignant IEC from apoptosis also through STAT3 activation5. Moreover, activation of IL-6-STAT3 signaling in normal gastric fibroblasts contributes to their conversion into CAF9. Such findings indicate that tumor development is highly dependent on intricate interactions between multiple cell types, in addition to malignant epithelial cells that harbor oncogenic mutations3,10,11. We found that inflammatory processes also play a critical role in development of sporadic CRC, which is driven by APC loss12. Absence of APC in IEC results in rapid loss of several components of the epithelial barrier that prevent invasion of the colonic mucosa by components of the endogenous microbiome, thereby leading to highly elevated expression of the key inflammatory cytokine IL-23 in myeloid cells12. By expanding the number of IL-17-producing cells, IL-23 provides a supportive inflammatory microenvironment that accelerates tumor progression12,13.

The TME, which is enriched in immune cells including TAM and various lymphocytes, as well as CAF, can also affect the response to therapy in many cancers, including CRC14,15. Anticancer drugs are frequently rendered ineffective against cancer cells that are co-cultured with stromal cells16. For this reason, identification of therapeutic targets that concomitantly affect the malignant behavior of cancer cells and the supportive function of the TME is of particular importance. Although targeted biological therapy is rapidly becoming the standard of care in advanced CRC17, very few targeted therapeutics were found to affect the TME. Of note, antagonists of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mainly affect malignant epithelial cells, but inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) target the TME and block its ability to stimulate tumor angiogenesis but have no direct activity on cancer cells17. Therefore, EGFR and VEGF inhibitors need to be combined, in order to target both the malignant cell and its supportive microenvironment.

In addition to STAT3, another potential therapeutic target in CRC is the ubiquitously expressed insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), which is involved in diverse processes, including mitogenesis, cell survival and differentiation18,19. In vitro experiments and epidemiological studies have suggested that IGF-1R participates in the pathogenesis of many neoplastic diseases, including CRC19–21. Elevated IGF-1R and IGF-1 expression correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis in several cancer types including gastrointestinal malignancies21,22. Genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding IGF-1R signaling components and increased circulating IGF-1 or IGF-2 were detected in CRC patients23–25. In addition, IGF-1R-driven PI3K/AKT signaling, predicts poor survival in CRC independently of the KRAS mutational status25. Furthermore, IGF-1R signaling contributes to resistance to cytotoxic26, radiation27 and targeted28–30 therapies. Importantly, the pro-oncogenic activities of IGF-1R are highly dependent on its proximal downstream effectors: insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), and IRS231,32. IRS1 is upregulated in primary and metastatic human CRC compared to the normal colonic epithelium33. ApcMIN mice, which carry an inactivating somatic mutation in the murine Apc gene, develop significantly fewer intestinal adenomatous polyps when the Irs1 gene is inactivated32.

The involvement of IRS proteins in tumor progression, metastasis and acquired drug resistance31,34,35 establishes them as potential and novel targets for anti-cancer drugs. With that in mind, NT157 was developed as a prototypic, first-in-class, compound that binds to an allosteric site on IGF-1R and induces a conformational change, which results in dissociation of receptor-bound IRS1 and IRS2 proteins35. This allows IGF-1R to interact more strongly with the adaptor protein Shc, resulting in enhanced activation of ERK, which mediates serine phosphorylation and subsequent proteolysis of IRS proteins. Eventually, NT157 leads to long-lasting IGF-1R inhibition, cancer cell apoptosis and additional antitumor effects, independently of IGF-1 binding35. Another IGF-1R-independent effect of NT157 is the dephosphorylation of STAT3 (see accompanying manuscript). The ability of NT157 to inhibit two different signaling pathways critical for CRC development drove us to test its activity in both sporadic and metastatic CRC mouse models. We now show that NT157 prevents colorectal tumor development, leads to durable regression of established tumors and attenuates growth in the liver metastatic niche. In addition to having direct effects on cancer cells, NT157 inhibits critical components of the TME, including CAF and TAM. Thus, NT157 is a new type of therapeutic compound that, as a single agent, concomitantly targets two essential signaling pathways in malignant cells and components of their supportive microenvironment, resulting in strong and pluripotent anti-cancer activity.

RESULTS

NT157 reduces tumor burden in CPC-APC mice

We used a mouse model of sporadic colorectal tumorigenesis, the CPC-APC mouse, in which one Apc tumor suppressor allele is specifically deleted in the distal colonic epithelium and the second allele undergoes loss-of-heterozygocity (LOH), the same process that drives human CRC development36. APC-deficient intestinal organoids exhibited elevated IGF-1R and IRS1 mRNA expression, whereas colonic tumors from CPC-APC mice showed elevated expression of IGF-1R, IRS1 and IRS2 mRNAs (Supplementary Figure 1A,B). IGF-1R was widely expressed in several TME cell types, including epithelial cancer cells, CAF and myeloid cells (Supplementary Figure 1C). Elevated IGF-1 in the circulation and in tumor-CM was also observed (Supplementary Figure 1D,E). Consistent with previous results35, treatment of APC-deficient intestinal organoids and tumor-bearing mice with NT157 resulted in a rather rapid decrease in IRS1 abundance (Supplementary Figure 1F–H). Encouraged by these results, we subjected CPC-APC mice, which develop colonic adenomas at 8 to 10 weeks of age, to either early (initiated at 8 weeks) or late (initiated at 16 weeks) treatment with NT157 (Figure 1a). In both cases, NT157 treatment significantly reduced tumor burden (Figure 1b,c), suggesting a role for the IGF-1R-IRS axis in colonic tumor development and maintenance in CPC-APC mice. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the late treatment group confirmed that NT157 used as a single agent significantly prolonged survival (Figure 1d). Even 7 weeks after treatment termination, tumor size remained significantly suppressed in NT157 treated mice (Supplementary Figure 1I). NT157 treatment reduced the proliferation and induced apoptosis of cancer cells (Figure 1e,f), along with IRS1 Ser-phosphorylation (Figure 1g).

NT157 reduces tumor inflammation and reactive stroma

The IGF-1R-IRS and the IL-6-STAT3 signaling pathways are co-activated in different pathological contexts37,38,39. NT157 treatment inhibited STAT3 activation in several cancer cells lines (see accompanying manuscript), including murine and human CRC cells and the TME (Figure 2a, b, d). NT157 slightly increased SHP2 protein expression in some cell lines, but that did not correlate with its effects on STAT3 activation by IL-6, which was consistently inhibited (Figure 2c, d). STAT3 stimulates Cox2 gene transcription40 and correspondingly NT157 blocked COX-2 expression in the TME (Figure 2a,b). NT157 treatment also reduced the expression of numerous chemokines, chemokine receptors and proinflammatory cytokines, including CCL2, CCR2, CCL5, IL-6, IL-11, IL-22 and IL-23 (Figure 2e), which was accompanied by a decrease in intratumoral CD11b+ and F4/80+ cells, and αSMA-expressing CAF (Figure 2f). Reduced CAF activation was associated with decreased collagen type I deposition and fibrogenic genes expression (Supplementary Figure 2A,B).

NT157 inhibits cancer cell proliferation and signaling

To better understand the cellular targets for NT157, we evaluated which effects are rapidly induced by NT157 and which are the consequence of prolonged treatment. We treated 16 week-old CPC-APC mice with NT157 for one week, and sacrificed them 24 hrs after the last dose. Even this short treatment period decreased tumor multiplicity (Figure 2g). After only two doses, NT157 reduced the number of proliferative Ki67+ cells in tumors, and induced cancer cell death, without affecting the normal tissue (Figure 2h,i). We further evaluated the effect of NT157 on TME populations. After short NT157 treatment, no changes in immune cell populations in spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and normal colon tissue were observed (Supplementary Figure 3A,B). No significant changes in tumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cells (CD11b+Gr-1+), dendritic cells (CD11b+MHCII+CD11c+), inflammatory macrophages (CD11b+MHCII+F4/80+), or lymphocytes (CD4+, CD8+, NK1.1+ and CD19+) were found, either (Supplementary Figure 3C,D). Also, no changes in RORγt+ or IL-17A-producing cells in MLN and spleen were observed (Supplementary Figure 3F), neither was expression of Th17 signature genes, other than IL-21 (Supplementary Figure 3G). By contrast, a substantial reduction in gp38+αSMA+ CAF abundance was observed (Supplementary Figure 3E), suggesting that inhibition of CAF activation represents a rapid response to NT157 treatment.

Consistent with its ability to induce IRS1 degradation, NT157 led to ERK1/2 activation independently of IGF-1 (Figure 3a,b,d and Supplementary Figure 4H). This was accompanied by inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of AKT, ribosomal protein S6 and 4E-BP, especially upon IGF-1 stimulation (Figure 3a–d and Supplementary Figure 4H). The anti-proliferative effect of NT157 in mouse and human CRC cell was reflected in reduced cell viability (Supplementary Figure 4A–F) and cyclin D1 expression, and caspase-3 activation at 48 hrs after treatment initiation. In APC-deficient organoids, NT157 also inhibited cyclin D1 expression (Figure 3f). These results indicate that disruption of the IGF-1R-IRS axis inhibits downstream signaling pathways that control cancer cell proliferation and survival. A further decrease in cell survival and proliferation is likely to be caused by inhibition of STAT3 activation.

NT157 decreases CRC cell growth in the metastatic niche

IGF-1R signaling and IRS proteins control migratory and invasive behavior of cancer cells31,34. In the presence of IGF-1, the MC-38, HCT116 and DLD-1 cell lines displayed enhanced migratory behavior, as shown by scratch and boyden chamber assays, and this behavior was inhibited by NT157 (Figure 4a–d and Supplementary Figure 4I). Several chemokines produced by cancer cells may facilitate migratory behavior41,42. Of note, NT157 inhibited expression of CXCL5 and CXCL7 in MC-38 cells incubated with LPS, a TLR4 agonist (Supplementary Figure 5A). Although NT157 did not affect the expression of CCL20 or CXCL12 in MC-38 cells, it did reduce CCL2 expression (Supplementary Figure 5A). Long-term treatment with NT157 also decreased the expression of CXCL5, MIP-2γ and IL-8 in colonic tumors (Supplementary Figure 5B). To test the effect of NT157 on the metastatic growth of CRC cells in liver, we injected MC-38 cells intrasplenically and initiated treatment with NT157 one week later (Figure 4e). NT157 treatment significantly decreased the size of liver metastases (Figure 4f,g), and reduced cell proliferation within metastatic nodules (Figure 4h, i). Importantly, the number of αSMA-expressing cells surrounding CRC cells in the liver was also diminished after NT157 treatment (Figure 4h, i). These data suggest that NT157 targets CRC cells that migrate, reducing their ability to grow at the new site and inhibiting the support they receive from activated myofibroblasts or hepatic stellate cells.

NT157 inhibits CAF and macrophage activation

IGF-1 is a well-known autocrine and paracrine inducer of CAF activation15. We isolated CAF from CPC-APC mice, and stimulated them with IGF-1. This resulted in increased αSMA expression, which was abolished when cells were treated with NT157 (Figure 5a,b). NT157 treatment also decreased the induction of collagen type I as well as TGFβ, CTGF and FAP mRNAs (Figure 5b). Activated CAF also produced inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-11, and matrix metalloproteinases15, including MMP3, which expression was also abolished by NT157 (Figure 5b). NT157 also inhibited induction of IL-6, IL-11, collagen type I, CTGF and TGFβ mRNAs by other CAF activators, including CTGF and TGFβ (Supplementary Figure 6a).

TAM are another important source of tumor-promoting cytokines in CRC3. Although we did not observe an obvious effect on the number of TAM after short term NT157 treatment, long term NT157 treatment reduced the expression of numerous inflammatory cytokines (Figure 2d). To test the effect of NT157 treatment on macrophages, we used bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). Using LPS as a generic BMDM activator, we found that NT157 inhibited the induction of IL-6, IL-11 and IL-10 mRNAs (Figure 5c) and the, presumably autocrine, activation of STAT3 (Figure 5d). Consistent with these results, NT157 also inhibited the induction of IL-23, IL-12, IFNγ and IL-1β mRNAs (Figure 5e). Surprisingly, NT157 enhanced the secretion TNF secretion, while inhibiting IL-6 secretion (Figure 5f).

DISCUSSION

In addition to the genetic and epigenetic alterations that account for malignant transformation, the TME is another key regulator of tumorigenesis and metastatogenesis. In particular, inflammatory cell infiltration and activation in early stages of colorectal tumorigenesis enhances proliferation of transformed IEC in which β-catenin has been activated, and renders them resistant to apoptotic elimination3,10. This microenvironmental effect is responsible for accelerating of tumor progression. Deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) by CAF further facilitates tumor growth and spread through effects on endothelial cells that turn on the angiogenic switch14,15. The emergence of the TME as an essential driver of malignant progression suggests that therapies that target TME components in addition to cancer cells, should have strong anti-tumor activity. Although TME-targeting therapies should be less susceptible to development of drug resistance because the TME is composed of genetically normal and stable cells, the existence of several distinct and interactive cell types within the TME, each relying on different signaling pathways, renders this task a difficult one. For instance, anti-angiogenic therapies that target VEGFR on endothelial cells were found to upregulate components of the EGFR and FGFR signaling pathways in the tumor bed43. Another unexpected effect is exhibited by anti-CCL2 therapy, which potentiates metastasis within weeks after its termination, by enhancing macrophage recruitment into metastatic sites44. Taking all of these points into consideration, we examined the ability of NT157, a novel tyrphostin that can inhibit at least two oncogenic signaling pathways, IGF-1R-IRS and JAK-STAT3, to target both carcinoma cells and their microenvironment in a mouse model of sporadic CRC. Our results demonstrate that NT157 effectively reduced tumor multiplicity and size through pleiotropic effects on CRC cells and the reactive stroma within which they reside. The rapid inactivation of CAF, and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and viability, as well as cytokine production, result in a less reactive microenvironment and a further decrease in myeloid cell infiltration. Importantly, the inhibition of STAT3 and IGF-1R-IRS signaling by NT157 prolongs the survival of CPC-APC mice, in which CRC development is driven by the same genetic and immune mechanisms responsible for development of aggressive human CRC12. In fact, weeks after treatment cessation, colonic tumors in NT157-treated CPC-APC mice remain smaller than those in non-treated mice, supporting the idea that conversion of the TME compartment to a less reactive and less inflamed state along with cancer cell targeting results in severe impairment of malignancy. Our results strongly support further clinical evaluation of NT157 and similar compounds in sporadic human CRC.

At this point, it is difficult to discern whether inhibition of STAT3 or blockade of IGF-1R-IRS signaling makes a more important contribution to the anti-neoplastic activity of NT157. A role for the IGF-1R-IRS axis in the pathogenesis of CRC is supported by human association studies. Genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding IGF family members and related proteins, including IGF-1 and IGFBP3, are associated with CRC development24. Elevated plasma IGF-1 and IGF-1R downstream signaling have been linked to enhanced risk of colorectal neoplasia and poor survival21,23–25,45. Importantly, a prospective study of a cohort of 210 CRC patients showed that tumor size and depth of invasion significantly correlate with IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression23. To closely mimic sporadic human CRC, we have used the CPC-APC mouse model, as both depend on loss of the APC tumor suppressor. In addition, CPC-APC mice exhibit strong activation of the IL-23-IL-17 cytokine cascade12, which predicts rapid progression to metastatic disease in human CRC46. We found that loss of APC expression in intestinal organoids and colonic tumors results in upregulation of IGF-1R and IRS1 expression, findings that are similar to those made in human CRC. We also found that several TME constituents, including CAF and TAM, exhibit activation of IGF-1R-IRS signaling, which is likely to be sustained by circulating IGF-1, whose concentrations in CPC-APC mice are higher than in control littermates. Combined with overexpression of IGF-1R and IRS proteins in CRC cells, elevated IGF-1 secretion into the tumor bed results in a strong activation of this pathway. Altogether, these findings justify the use of the CPC-APC model for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of IGF-1R-IRS signaling inhibitors.

NT157 was identified as an IGF-1R signaling inhibitor that acts through a novel mechanism: binding of NT157 to IGF-1R promotes the detachment of IRS proteins, thereby facilitating Shc recruitment and activation of ERK1/2, which eventually phosphorylate IRS proteins and induce their degradation35. We have confirmed that in both murine and human CRC cells, NT157 activated ERK1/2, independently of IGF-1 binding to IGF-1R, resulting in inhibition of AKT activation. We also found that NT157 effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of mTORC1 downstream targets, including ribosomal protein S6 and 4EBP1. These effects may contribute to the ability of NT157 to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and survival. Another mechanism through which NT157 can compromise cancer cell proliferation and survival is inhibition of STAT3 activation (see accompanying manuscript). We confirmed that NT157 inhibited STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation not only in colorectal tumors, but also in IL-6 treated murine and human CRC cells and LPS-stimulated macrophages. Importantly, our previous work indicated that STAT3 activation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of both CAC in mice treated with AOM+DSS5 and sporadic colonic tumorigenesis in CPC-APC mice12. STAT3 is involved in both the survival and the proliferation of CRC cells10 and part of the anti-proliferative effect of NT157 could be due to inhibition of cyclin D1 expression, which is induced by STAT3. NT157 treatment also inhibited the expression of COX-2, which is also encoded by a STAT3 target gene. COX-2 is responsible for production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE ), which stimulates malignant progression by promoting the survival of CRC cells and increasing their motility47. PGE  can also enhance production of IL-23 by myeloid cells3, which further stimulates CRC progression through the IL-23-IL-17 cytokine cascade. Notably, selective COX-2 inhibitors reduce CRC incidence48, although they also exacerbate intestinal injury3, thereby limiting their utility. In contrats, inhibition of COX-2 expression in colonic tumors by NT157 treatment offers a more selective therapeutic option for blocking the production of pro-tumorigenic PGE  in CRC.

Both CAF and myeloid cells contribute to STAT3 activation in cancer cells by producing IL-6 and IL-1112,15. Importantly, the anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic effects of NT157 are also manifested in these major TME constituents. TAM are important regulators of solid tumor development based on their ability to enhance angiogenic, invasive and metastatic programming of neoplastic tissue, and their presence in human cancer usually correlates with a worse clinical outcome49. In BMDM stimulated with LPS, NT157 blocked the induction of IL-6, IL-11 and IL-10, pro-tumorigenic cytokines that mediate STAT3 activation, as well as IL-23, IL-12, IFNγ and IL-1β. Surprisingly, however, NT157 enhanced TNF secretion in the presence of LPS, while inhibiting IL-6 secretion. The mechanistic basis for this phenomenon is far from clear, but it should be noted that no increase in intratumoral TNF was observed in NT157-treated CPC-APC mice. Importantly, NT157 treatment also decreased expression of several chemokines and chemokine receptors, including CCL2, CCR2 and CCL5 both in isolated cells and in tumors. This effect may explain the reduced amount of inflammatory infiltrate in colonic tumors of NT157-treated mice. However, NT157 did not affect intratumoral Th17 cells or their product, IL-17A. Nonetheless, inhibition of colonic tumor growth by NT157 was as extensive as the inhibition afforded by IL-17A neutralization, but unlike IL-17A neutralization, which only reduced tumor development when applied early13, the tumoricidal effect of NT157 was observed even when its administration was delayed until after tumor establishment. Furthermore, the therapeutic effect of NT157 was durable and was sustained for at least 7 weeks after treatment cessation and prolonged survival.

As cancers progress, their stroma becomes more reactive, phenotypically mimicking tissues undergoing wound healing or chronic inflammation. Indeed, many solid human malignancies are characterized by desmoplasia, containing high numbers of myofibroblasts15. CAF inactivation by NT157 was accompanied by decreased collagen type I expression and deposition, and reduced expression of fibrogenic and inflammatory cytokines, including CTGF, TGFβ, IL-6 and IL-11. In addition to eliminating the tumor supportive functions of the TME, NT157 treatment may also result in improved delivery of cytotoxic drugs. Importantly, the effects of NT157 are not limited to the TME and are also exerted on malignant epithelial cells. In addition to the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and survival, NT157 also attenuates the migratory and invasive behavior of metastatic CRC cells and decreases their ability to proliferate forming metastatic lesions in the liver, the most common site of CRC metastasis. Although the precise mechanism by which NT157 inhibits liver metastasis remains to be determined, previous studies have revealed an important role for IL-6 signaling in this process50. Thus, it is conceivable that the effect of NT157 may be related to its ability to inhibit IL-6-induced STAT3 activation.

In summary, NT157 represents a new type of a multi-pronged therapeutic agent that targets at least two major oncogenic signaling pathways (IGF-1R-IRS and JAK-STAT3). Importantly, NT157 exerts its effects on several cell types involved in cancer development and progression, including malignant epithelial cells, CAF and TAM. This broad and pluripotent effect may explain the remarkable anti-tumor activity exhibited by NT157 when it was used as a single agent.
