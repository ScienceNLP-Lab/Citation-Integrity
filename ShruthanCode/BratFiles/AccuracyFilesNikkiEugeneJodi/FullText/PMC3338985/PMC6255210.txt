Inhibition of HDAC3 reverses Alzheimer’s disease-related pathologies in vitro and in the 3xTg-AD mouse model
Significance

With the imminent increase of the elderly population worldwide, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most significant medical problems in modern society. Although nonselective histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins delineate a promising druggable target and nonselective HDAC inhibitors have been shown effective for other indications, they present a wide spectrum of side-effects. Selective inhibition of HDAC isoforms may, however, greatly eliminate such toxicities while presenting improved efficacy. We demonstrate that RGFP-966, a selective HDAC3 inhibitor, decreases accumulation of proteins relevant for AD pathophysiology and alleviates memory impairment in an AD mouse model. The presented work provides evidence for a crucial role of HDAC3 in mediating AD-like pathology and opens an avenue for the discovery of epigenetic therapeutics for AD.

Abstract

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of age-related dementia. Neuropathological hallmarks of AD include brain deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and accumulation of both hyperphosphorylated and acetylated tau. RGFP-966, a brain-penetrant and selective HDAC3 inhibitor, or HDAC3 silencing, increases BDNF expression, increases histone H3 and H4 acetylation, decreases tau phosphorylation and tau acetylation at disease-associated sites, reduces β-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and decreases Aβ  accumulation in HEK-293 cells overexpressing APP with the double Swedish mutation (HEK/APP ). In the triple transgenic AD mouse model (3xTg-AD), repeated administration of 3 and 10 mg/kg of RGFP-966 reverses pathological tau phosphorylation at Thr181, Ser202, and Ser396, increases levels of the Aβ degrading enzyme Neprilysin in plasma, decreases Aβ  protein levels in the brain and periphery, and improves spatial learning and memory. Finally, we show that RGFP-966 decreases Aβ  accumulation and both tau acetylation and phosphorylation at disease residues in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells obtained from APOEε4-carrying AD patients. These data indicate that HDAC3 plays an important regulatory role in the expression and regulation of proteins associated with AD pathophysiology, supporting the notion that HDAC3 may be a disease-modifying therapeutic target.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a slow progressive degeneration of the brain (1, 2). Molecular neuropathological hallmarks of AD include accumulation of intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau and brain deposition of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques (1, 3, 4). Aβ is a metabolite of the successive cleavage of mature amyloid precursor protein (N- and O-glycosylated, mAPP) by β-secretases (BACE1, BACE2) and γ-secretase complex [including Presenilin 1 (PSEN1), Presenilin 2 (PSEN2), and others] (5). Both genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to AD etiopathogenesis. Nongenetic mechanisms contributing to changes in the expression of AD-related genes are defined as epigenetic processes. Epigenetic dysfunction has been previously linked to the pathophysiology of AD (6). Epigenetic modifications take place in the nucleosome, the fundamental unit of the eukaryotic chromosome composed of 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of core histone proteins (two of each H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). On the amino-terminal of each histone subunit, multiple sites exist for potential posttranslational modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination (7). Each of these reversible modifications is removed, read, or added by a particular set of histone-interacting regulatory proteins—namely “erasers,” “readers,” or “writers”—which in turn alter chromatin structure and thus influence gene expression (8). Modulation of epigenetic enzymes has been shown to be critically involved in behavioral and molecular responses involved in the development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders (3, 6, 9). Among the common epigenetic mechanisms, histone acetylation by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylation by histone deacetylases (HDACs), are the most-studied histone posttranslational modifications relevant for cognition in neuropsychiatric diseases (10–12). Histone deacetylation at specific lysine residues has been particularly implicated in contributing to the AD-like phenotype, thus multiple nonselective HDAC inhibitors have been tested for their potential in reversing pathological hallmarks of AD in vitro and in vivo (6, 13, 14).

Based on the sequence homology and domain organization, the HDAC family of proteins is divided into two categories (the zinc-dependent HDACs and the NAD+-dependent HDACs) and four subfamilies, (classes I, IIa, IIb, III, and IV) (15–17). Although class I HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC8) are ubiquitously expressed, HDAC3’s expression is highest in brain regions implicated in memory and learning, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and cortical areas (13, 18). Considering the large experimental evidence indicating decreased histone acetylation levels in various neurodegenerative disorders and a growing body of literature supporting a crucial role of HDAC3 in chromatin maintenance, genome stability, and neuronal plasticity (13, 16, 19, 20), we investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibition and genetic silencing of HDAC3 on AD-related pathologies in various cellular and animal models.

Results

Pharmacological Inhibition and Genetic Silencing of HDAC3 Decreases HDAC3 Activity.

We first determined the selectivity profile of RGFP-966 against class I HDACs (HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8) using a cell-free HDAC3 activity assay (Materials and Methods). We observed that RGFP-966 is 3.1 ± 0.05 times more selective for HDAC3 over HDAC1 (P = 0.02) and 5.0 ± 0.2 times more selective for HDAC3 over HDAC2 (P = 0.005). No inhibition of HDAC8 was observed in response to RGFP-966 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). RGFP-966 inhibits HDAC3 with an IC  of 1.5 μM, HDAC2 with an IC  of 6.8 μM, and HDAC1 with an IC  of 4.423 μM (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) was used as a positive control. Next, we used the HEK/APP  cell line, a well-established AD cellular model, harboring an APP double mutation (KM670/671NL) immediately adjacent to the β-secretase cleavage site (SI Appendix, Materials and Methods) to validate HDAC3 activity following 48 h of treatment with 1, 3, and 10 µM RGFP-966. DMSO at a 0.1% (vol/vol) concentration diluted in cell culture media was used as a negative control. There was a significant effect of the treatment on HDAC3 activity in HEK/APP  cells for the described conditions [F(3, 16) = 22.63, P < 0.001], as revealed by ANOVA. The mean HDAC3 activity for the 10 µM RGFP-966 condition (34.7 ± 9.0%) was significantly different from the control group (97.27 ± 9.10%; P < 0.001). However, the activity of HDAC3 following treatment with 3 µM and 1 µM RGFP-966 (78.4 ± 2.0% and 97.3 ± 9.2%, respectively) did not differ significantly from the control group (P = 0.96, P = 0.06, respectively) (Fig. 1A). Class I HDACs mRNA expression was not affected by treatment with 10 μM RGFP-966 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B).

Next, we evaluated the effect of RGFP-966 on HEK/APP  cells viability. Velcade (Bortezumib, 10 μM) was used as a positive control for cell death. Cell culture media without cells served as a background control for the experiment. A one-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of treatment on cell viability [F(5, 18) = 60.30, P < 0.001]. Tukey’s multiple-comparisons test indicated that the mean luminescence signal indicative of cell viability was not significantly different for RGFP-966 treated cells (10 µM: 4.4 × 106 ± 5 × 104, P = 0.99; 3 µM: 4.6 × 106 ± 2.1 × 104; 1 µM: 4.4 × 106 ± 3.3 × 104) compared with control cells (4.4 × 106 ± 4.2 × 104) (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that RGFP-966 does not affect cell viability in concentrations up to 10 µM. Velcade decreased cell viability (1,180 ± 424) compared with control cells (P < 0.001) (Fig. 1B). We also evaluated the effect of various concentrations on DMSO on HEK/APP  cell viability and we determined that DMSO does not cause any cell toxicity in concentrations up to 1% (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Next, we used HEK/APP  cells stably transfected with scrambled short-hairpin RNA (shScramble) and HDAC3 short-hairpin RNA (shHDAC3) expression vectors to evaluate the effect of HDAC3 genetic silencing on HDAC3 activity. Successful transfection and efficient HDAC3 silencing was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A) and Western blot analysis (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). HDAC3 activity decreased 51 ± 8% [unpaired t test, t(4) = 9.322, P = 0.0004] in shHDAC3-treated cells compared with shScramble control (SI Appendix, Fig. S3C).

Acetylation of Histones H3 and H4 Increases in Response to RGFP-966 Treatment and HDAC3 Silencing.

Histone-associated heterochromatin undergoes structural changes during the formation of long-term memory and an increase in histones H3 and H4 acetylation is positively correlated with learning and memory formation (6, 21). To investigate the effect of RGFP-966 on the acetylation status of core histones in vitro, HEK/APP  cells were treated with 10 µM of RGFP-966 for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 24, and 48 h and several acetylated H3 and H4 lysine residues (i.e., H4K12ac, H3K4ac, H3K27ac, and H4K16ac) (21, 22) were examined. Two-way ANOVA test revealed significant effect of time [F(7, 14) = 10.5, P < 0.001], histone protein acetylation status [F(1, 2) = 359.2, P = 0.003], and interaction between time and histone acetylation status [F(7, 14) = 10.9, P < 0.001] for the described conditions. Dunnett’s post hoc test showed that histone H4K12 acetylation (H4K12ac) increased in a time-dependent manner, with significant increases at 6 h (2.27-fold increase, P < 0.001), 24 h (2.0-fold increase, P < 0.001), and 48 h posttreatment (2.4-fold increase, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2A). Using an ELISA for H4K12 acetylation, we confirmed an increase in H4K12ac following 48 h of treatment with 10 µM RGFP-966 [two-tailed unpaired t-test, t(6) = 4.10, P = 0.005] (Fig. 2B). In additional experiments, 48 h of treatment with RGFP-966 significantly increases acetylation of H3K4 [222.9 ± 22.6% increase, t(6) = 9.85, P < 0.001], H3K27 [118.6 ± 32.4% increase, t(6) = 3.66, P = 0.01], and H4K16 [172.6 ± 19.2% increase, t(6) = 9.0, P < 0.001] compared with control-treated cells (Fig. 2C). In agreement with previous results regarding HDAC3 activity (Fig. 1A), we did not observe any changes in total histone protein or histone acetylation at H3K4, H3K27, H4K16, and H4K12 following treatment with 1 µM of RGFP-966 (P > 0.05 for all groups) (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). Additionally, acetylation of a nonhistone protein, tubulin was not affected by 48 h of treatment with 10 µM RGFP-966 in the HEK/APP  cells [t(6) = 0.28, P = 0.41] (SI Appendix, Fig. S4B).

HDAC3 Regulates Tau Phosphorylation.

Excessive tau phosphorylation at Thr181, Ser202, and Ser396 has been previously shown to inhibit physiological tau binding to microtubules, thus impairing its physiological function (23, 24). To examine the potential role of HDAC3 inhibition on the kinetics of tau phosphorylation in HEK/APP  cells, cultures were treated with 10 µM RGFP-966 for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h. Next, whole-cell lysates were immunoblotted using antibodies against total tau and different tau phosphorylation residues: that is, phosho-tau Thr181, phospho-tau Ser202, and phospho-tau Ser396 (paired helical filaments, PHF-1). Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant effect of the treatment on various tau phosphorylation residues for the control [0.1% DMSO (vol/vol)] and 10 μM RGFP-966 conditions [F(6, 6) = 4.58, P = 0.04]. Dunnett’s post hoc test indicated that tau phosphorylation at Thr181 decreased significantly following 48 h of 10 μM RGFP-966 treatment compared with control (69.1 ± 18.8% decrease, P = 0.014). Similarly, tau phosphorylation at Ser202 was significanlty reduced following 24 and 48 h of treatment (77.8 ± 12.1% decrease, P = 0.06 and 98.5 ± 18.7%, P = 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, phosphorylation of tau at Ser396 was not affected by treatment with RGFP-966 at any time point throughout the treatment (Fig. 3A).

Next, we used pcDNA3.1-Flag-HDAC3 plasmid to transiently overexpress HDAC3 in HEK/APP  cells and we observed significant increases of tau phosphorylation at Thr181 and at Ser202 in cells transfected with HDAC3 compare with cells transfected with control plasmid [Thr181: 340.8 ± 59.8% increase, t(14) = 5.699, P < 0.001; Ser202: 292.4 ± 40.2% increase, t(14) = 7.278, P < 0.001]. HDAC3 overexpression had no effect on phosphorylation of tau at Ser396 compared with control [t(14) = 0.9658, P = 0.35] (Fig. 3B). These presented results indicate that changes in tau phosphorylation at Thr181 and Ser202 are mediated through an HDAC3-dependent mechanism. Throughout the course of the experiment, total tau protein expression (Fig. 3B) and total tau mRNA expression level (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A) were not affected by treatment with 10 µM RGFP-966. To further investigate the underpinnings of the HDAC3-mediated tau phosphorylation mechanism in HEK/APP  cells, we evaluated the effect of genetic silencing of HDAC3 (shHDAC3) on tau phosphorylation at Thr181, Ser202, and Ser396. We found a significant decrease of tau phosphorylation in shHDAC3 HEK/APP  cells compared with shScramble control cells [Thr181: 75.2 ± 4.0% decrease, t(12) = 18.99, P < 0.001; Ser202: 55.6 ± 8.1% decrease, t(12) = 6.909, P < 0.001] (Fig. 3C). Phosphorylation of tau at Ser396 was not affected [t(12) = 1.628, P = 0.130] (Fig. 3C). We further evaluated the effect of genetic silencing of HDAC1 (shHDAC1) and HDAC2 (shHDAC2) on tau phosphorylation and we did not observe any differences in tau phosphorylation at investigated residues in HEK/APP  cells [Thr181: F(2, 15) = 0.836, P = 0.453; Ser202: F(2, 15) = 0.65, P = 0.53; Ser396: F(2, 15) = 0.065, P = 0.53] (Fig. 3D). Tau mRNA levels remained unchanged following silencing of HDAC1 and HDAC2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 C and D, respectively). Successful silencing of HDAC1 [t(10) = 19.37, P < 0.001] and HDAC2 [t(10) = 20.65, P < 0.001] was confirmed by RT-qPCR (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 E and F, respectively). These data indicate that the observed effects of RGFP-966 on tau phosphorylation are mediated via HDAC3 and not through HDACs 1- or 2-dependent mechanisms.

HDAC3 Inhibition Reduces Amyloidogenic APP Processing and Decreases Aβ1–42:Aβ1–40 Ratio.

Next, we tested the effect of various concentrations of RGFP-966 on APP processing in the HEK/APP  cells following 48 h of treatment. One-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the effect of various RGFP-966 concentrations on the average expression of APP metabolites and processing enzymes. We observed a significant effect of the treatment on average expression of secreted soluble APPα <sAPPα [F(5, 30) = 9.294, P < 0.001], APP [F(5, 30) = 2.086, P = 0.0013], BACE 1 [F(5, 54) = 4.354, P < 0.001], BACE2 [F(5, 48) = 2.570, P < 0.001], and sAPPβ [F(5, 36) = 1.420, P = 0.009]>. The mean expression of neuroprotective sAPPα and APP was significantly increased following 48 h of 10 µM RGFP-966 treatment compared with the vehicle-treated group [sAPPα: 139.4 ± 26.8% increase, P < 0.001 (Fig. 4A); APP: 35.24 ± 10.3% increase, P = 0.008 (Fig. 4B)]. However, none of the other RGFP-966 concentrations (i.e., 1 μM, 0.1 μM, 10 nM, and 1 nM) affected expression of sAPPα or APP (P > 0.05 for the remaining treatment groups). Fig. 4 C and D depict representative Western blots demonstrating changes in sAPPα and APP relative to Ponceau or GAPDH loading controls following treatment with RGFP-966. In line with current discoveries, we also observed that the C-terminal fragment of APP (i.e., CTF-α) increased significantly after 48 h of treatment with 10 μM RGFP-966 [2.3 ± 0.2-fold increase, t(10) = 3.272, P < 0.001] (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). Presented results indicate that inhibition of HDAC3 plays a role in the proteolytic cleavage of APP protein during nonamyloidogenic processing by α-secretase. Thus, we further investigated the expression level of enzymes responsible for the amyloidogenic APP proteolytic cleavage: that is, BACE1, an aspartic protease responsible for Aβ generation, and BACE2, a protease significantly less abundant in the brain that complexes with BACE1. An ANOVA test revealed significant main effect of the treatment on BACE1 [F(5, 54) = 7.082, P < 0.001] and BACE 2 [F(5, 48) = 11.46, P < 0.001] expression. Dunnett’s multiple-comparisons test indicated that BACE1 and BACE2 mRNA expression levels decreased in response to 10 μM RGFP-966 treatment (BACE1: 56.8 ± 10.9% decrease, P < 0.001; BACE2: 53.5 ± 10.3% decrease, P < 0.001) (Fig. 4 E and F, respectively). We also observed significant decrease of sAPPβ in response to 48 h of HEK/APP  cells treatment with 10 μM RGFP-966 (9.2 ± 2.6 pg/mL decrease, P = 0.006) (Fig. 4G). Interestingly we observed a significant decrease in neurotoxic Aβ  and increase in nontoxic Aβ  (Fig. 4H), resulting in an overall dose-dependent decrease in the Aβ  to Aβ  ratio (SI Appendix, Fig. S6B). Additionally, genetic silencing of HDAC3 significantly increased the expression of neuroprotective APP protein [t(10) = 3.272, P = 0.008] (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A) and CTFα [t(10) = 10.27, P < 0.001] (SI Appendix, Fig. S7B). We demonstrated that HDAC3 genetic silencing (shHDAC3) decreased BACE1 [19.3 ± 4.5% decrease, t(10) = 4.333, P = 0.002] (SI Appendix, Fig. S7D) and BACE2 [28.9 ± 9.0% decrease, t(10) = 3.202, P = 0.01] (SI Appendix, Fig. S7E) expression compared with shScramble control. Aβ  to Aβ  ratio was also decreased in response to HDAC3 silencing (SI Appendix, Fig. S7F), suggesting that the observed decrease in accumulation of Aβ protein is an HDAC3-mediated process.

RGFP-966 Restores Balance of Genes Dysregulated in AD Patients.

Next, we evaluated differential expression of 87 AD-related gene transcripts in HEK/APP  in response to 10 µM RGFP-966 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A) and HDAC3 genetic silencing (SI Appendix, Fig. S8B). A total of 26 genes were differentially expressed in response to RGFP-966: 18 transcripts were significantly up-regulated, 8 transcripts were significantly down-regulated (fold-change ≥ 1.2, P < 0.05, false-discovery rate < 0.05) (SI Appendix, Table S1). Similarly, we investigated the effect of HDAC3 genetic silencing, and we recorded 42 differentially expressed genes: 40 upregulated transcripts, 2 down-regulated transcripts (SI Appendix, Table S2). We identified a subset of six neuroprotective genes—BDNF, SIRT6, CLU, PSEN2, BIN1, PEN2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8C)—that are significantly up-regulated in both treatment groups (SI Appendix, Fig. S8D). Genes significantly down-regulated in either treatment group did not overlap in both groups.

HDAC3 Interacts with Tau in HEK/APPsw Cells.

To further understand the molecular mechanism by which inhibition of HDAC3 regulates tau protein biochemistry, we investigated the interaction between HDAC3 and tau. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were performed using lysates from HEK/APP  cell lysates. First, HDAC3 was immunoprecipitated by an anti-HDAC3 antibody and the coprecipitates were probed for tau. Membranes were also probed with anti-HDAC2 and anti-GAPDH antibodies as negative controls for the co-IP reaction. SI Appendix, Table S3 lists all antibodies used throughout the course of the experiment. As shown in Fig. 5A, HDAC2, HDAC3, five tau isoforms, and GAPDH bands were detected in both input lanes: control cells and RGFP-966–treated cells. Interestingly, HDAC3 coimmunoprecipitated with tau, suggesting that HDAC3 may interact with at least one tau isoform. This interaction was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of tau protein followed by immunoblotting with antibodies for HDAC2, HDAC3, tau, and GAPDH. As shown in Fig. 5B, HDAC3, but not HDAC2, could be pulled down with tau protein and the amount of tau–HDAC3 complex was increased following 48 h of cell treatment with 10 μM RGFP-966. GAPDH and HDAC2 protein did not co-IP with HDAC3 or tau. Taken together, the data demonstrate that tau and HDAC3 interact with each other in vitro.

Repeated Administration of RGFP-966 Improves Spatial and Recognition Memory in Transgenic Mice.

A cohort of 9-mo-old 3xTg-AD mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (5% Tween 20 in 0.9% normal saline) or RGFP-966 (3 or 10 mg/kg drug in 5% Tween 20 in 0.9% normal saline) for 3 mo. At 12 mo of age, behavioral tests were initiated and lasted throughout the course of 24 d. All treatments continued during the behavioral testing. SI Appendix, Fig. S9 depicts the timeline of drug treatment and behavioral experiments.

A one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the effect of the treatment on the mean spontaneous alternation rate in vehicle, 3-mg/kg RGFP-966, and 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 conditions. There was a significant effect of the treatment on average nesting score for the three conditions [F(2, 14) = 14.06, P = 0.0004]. Tukey’s multiple-comparison test indicated that the mean spontaneous alternation rate for the 3- and 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 conditions was significantly different from that of the vehicle-treated group (3 mg/kg: 28.2 ± 6.0% increase, P < 0.001; 10 mg/kg: 26.2 ± 6.2%, P = 0.002) (Fig. 6A). No changes in total number of arm entries wewe observed in response to the treatment (SI Appendix, Fig. S10). Spontaneous alternation rate and total number of arm entries were not affected 24 h after a single injection of 10 mg/kg RGFP-966 (SI Appendix, Fig. S11), ruling out possible acute effects of the compound. Next, the novel object recognition (NOR) test, consisting of a habituation phase (general open-field activities test) and a memory phase (short-term recognition test) (SI Appendix, Fig. S12A), was performed. A two-way repeated ANOVA analysis was used to analyze the open-field behavior. Each mouse on a given treatment was measured over time (creating a trajectory) during 3 different days (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 B and C). There was no significant overall treatment effect [F(2, 15) = 0.707, P = 0.51] and no overall day effect [F(2, 15) = 0.147, P = 0.87] for the three conditions. We determined that mouse trajectories changed with time [F(2, 255) = 10.847, P < 0.001] and that the trajectories differed across different days [F(4, 255) = 3.715, P = 0.006]. The interaction of the treatment and day with respect to the trajectory profile did not differ significantly (P = 0.73). We observed significant effect of the treatment on short-term recognition memory in vehicle, 3-mg/kg, and 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 conditions [F(2, 13) = 7.972, P = 0.006]. The Recognition Index (RI) for the 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 condition increased significantly compared with the vehicle-treated group (33.7 ± 8.5% increase, P = 0.004), while the 3-mg/kg RGFP-966–treated mice did not differ significantly from the vehicle-treated control group (P = 0.09) (Fig. 6B). Repeated administration of RGFP-966 did not affect mice traveling velocity (SI Appendix, Fig. S12D) or distance traveled (SI Appendix, Fig. S12E) during the memory test. Following a single administration of RGFP-966, no changes were observed in traveling velocity (SI Appendix, Fig. S13A), distance traveled (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B), and RI during the NOR test (SI Appendix, Fig. S13C). These data further support the hypothesis that long-term epigenetic changes induced by HDAC3 inhibition are required for improvement of recognition memory in 3xTg-AD mice.

Next, a two-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the effect of the treatment on the average latency to escape to the goal box during the Barnes maze test in vehicle, 3-mg/kg, and 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 conditions from day 1 to day 4. There was a significant effect of the day [F(3, 55) = 10.889, P < 0.001] and the treatment [F(2, 55) = 5.852, P = 0.005] for the three conditions. The mean latency to find the goal box did not differ from day 1 to day 4 in the vehicle-treated group (day 1: 137.2 ± 23.6 s; day 4: 85.5 ± 24.2 s; P = 0.87) (Fig. 6C). Conversely, the mean latency to find the goal box decreased significantly from day 1 to day 4 in the 3-mg/kg RGFP-966–treated group (day 1: 171.0 ± 9.0 s; day 4: 37.7 ± 10.7 s; P = 0.02) and 10-mg/kg RGFP-966–treated group (day 1: 165.0.0 ± 15.0 s; day 4: 29.5.7 ± 13.2 s; P = 0.02) (Fig. 6C). During the probe trial, mice treated with 10 mg/kg RGFP-966 committed significantly fewer errors compared with vehicle-treated mice (11.2 ± 2.4; P < 0.001) and compared with mice treated with 3 mg/kg RGFP-966 (6.3 ± 2.4, P = 0.04) (Fig. 6D). Mice treated with 3 mg/kg did not differ significantly from vehicle-treated mice in terms of number of errors committed (P = 0.14). All treatment groups did not differ in terms of traveling velocity (SI Appendix, Fig. S14A). We also observed that there was a significant effect of the treatment on the percent of mice guided to the goal box on training day 1 compared with training day 4 [F(2, 24) = 16.36, P < 0.001] (SI Appendix, Fig. S14B). Schematic representation of the Barnes maze test is depicted in SI Appendix, Fig. S14C. Using a two-way ANOVA test, we showed that there was a significant effect of RGFP-966 treatment on latency to fall off the rotating rod during a Rota-rod treadmill test for the three conditions. A multiple-comparisons test revealed that latency to fall off the rod did not differ in vehicle-treated mice between training session 1 and training session 9 (P = 0.96), while the latency increased significantly for mice treated with 3 and 10 mg/kg RGFP-966 (P = 0.008 and P < 0.001, respectively), indicating improvement in motor learning in mice treated with HDAC3i (Fig. 6E). We observed a statistically significant decrease in latency to fall off the rod during training session 9 between mice treated with vehicle and 10 mg/kg RGFP-966 (P < 0.001) (Fig. 6E), suggesting an increase in motor learning in mice treated with RGFP-966. Schematic representation of the Rota-rod treadmill test is depicted in SI Appendix, Fig. S15A. In the balance beam test, commonly used to test motor coordination and balance in mice (SI Appendix, Fig. S15B), a significant effect of the treatment on latency to fall off the balance beam was detected [F(2, 15) = 30.48, P < 0.001]. Tukey’s multiple-comparisons test indicated that the mean time spent on the balance beam for the 3- and 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 condition was significantly increased compare with the vehicle-treated group (3 mg/kg: 10.5 ± 1.8 s, P < 0.001; 10 mg/kg: 12.4 ± 1.7 s, P < 0.001) (Fig. 6F).

Next, we tested nest-building skills in the 3xTg-AD mice. Fig. 6G illustrates the average nesting scores achieved by vehicle control- and RGFP-966–treated mice. A one-way between-subjects ANOVA determined significant effect of the treatment on average nesting score for the three conditions [F(2, 16) = 4.574, P = 0.03]. The mean nesting score for the 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 condition was significantly increased compare with the vehicle-treated group (1.8 ± 0.6 increase; P = 0.02). However, the 3-mg/kg RGFP-966–treated group did not significantly differ from the vehicle-treated group (P = 0.58) or from the 10-mg/kg RGFP-966–treated group (P = 0.17). Improved nest-building skills have been shown to be indicative of mouse increased motivation and has been shown to be an ethologically relevant indicator of welfare (25); thus, these results suggest that the higher dose of RGFP-966 improves behavioral functions in 3xTg-AD mice. The described daily RGFP-966 treatment at 3 or 10 mg/kg did not affect mice body weight, organ weight, or organ-to-body weight ratio (SI Appendix, Fig. S16). SI Appendix, Table S4 includes raw statistical outputs from all behavioral experiments presented in the present report.

RGFP-966 Regulates the Aβ Degrading Enzyme, Neprilysin, and Decreases Aβ1–42 in the Brain and Plasma of 3xTg-AD Mice.

Following 12 wk and 24 d of daily intraperitoneal treatment with RGFP-966 or drug vehicle, we evaluated changes in Aβ accumulation and degradation by measuring changes in Aβ , neprilysin (NEP), an Aβ degrading enzyme known to play a major role in amyloid peptide catabolism (26), and APP processing enzymes (BACE1 and BACE2) in the brain and plasma of 3xTg-AD mice. One-way ANOVA showed a significant main effect of the treatment on the average Aβ  expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [F(2, 12 = 16.96), P = 0.0003]. Our results revealed that Aβ  was significantly lowered following repeated administration of 3 mg/kg (P = 0.002) and 10 mg/kg RGFP966 (P = 0.0004) (Fig. 7A). Following ANOVA testing, a post hoc test revealed significant decrease of Aβ  in the prefrontal cortex of the mice treated with 3 and 10 mg/kg RGFP-966 compared with vehicle control (3 mg/kg: 60.5 ± 14.3 pg/mL, P = 0.002; 10 mg/kg: 71.1 ± 14.2 pg/mL, P < 0.001), and decrease of Aβ  in the entorhinal cortex (7.4 ± 2.6 pg/mL, P = 0.027) and hippocampus (19.7 ± 3.5 pg/mL, P = 0.0002) of the mice treated with 10 mg/kg RGFP-966 compared with vehicle control (Fig. 7B). No changes in Aβ  were observed in the cerebellum (Fig. 7B). There was a significant effect of the treatment on the expression of NEP in the PBMCs of 3xTg-AD mice, compare with control [F(2, 12) = 37.17; P < 0.001] (Fig. 7C). In a post hoc test, NEP expression was significantly decreased in the 3- and 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 conditions (6.8 ± 1.7-fold, P = 0.008; 16.7 ± 1.9-fold, P < 0.00001, respectively) compared with vehicle-treated mice. No significant effect on NEP mRNA expression was observed in the brains of these mice (Fig. 7D). BACE1 protein was also significantly decreased in PBMCs after treatment with 10 mg/kg RGFP-966 (32 ± 6%, P = 0.009) (SI Appendix, Fig. S17A). Consistent with a significant decrease in Aβ  in the brain of 3xTg-AD mice, BACE1 protein expression was also decreased in the entorhinal cortex after treatment with 10 mg/kg RGFP-966 (29 ± 12%, P = 0.003) and in the hippocampus after treatment with both doses (3 mg/kg: 19 ± 2%, P = 0.02; 10 mg/kg: 28 ± 3%, P = 0.001) (SI Appendix, Fig. S17B). Notably, the described treatment did not affect the human transgene expression (i.e., APP, tau, and PSEN1) in the 3xTg-AD mice (SI Appendix, Fig. S18).

RGFP-966 Reduces Phosphorylation of Tau in the Brain of 3xTg-AD Mice in a Region-Specific Manner.

Next, we evaluated the effect of the treatment on tau phosphorylation at disease-relevant residues, as well as BDNF expression in the brain of 3xTg-AD mice. A one-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of the treatment on tau phosphorylation at Thr181 [F(2, 11) = 5.479, P = 0.022] and tau phosphorylation at Ser396 [F(2, 12) = 4.685, P = 0.031] for the three conditions. The mean tau Thr181 phosphorylation in the 3-mg/kg RGFP-966 (1,572 ± 513.5 P = 0.02) and the 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 (1,973 ± 204.9, P = 0.03) conditions were significantly different from the vehicle-treated group (9,156 ± 3,543) (Fig. 8A). Tau phosphorylation at Ser396 was significantly decreased in the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice in response to 3- and 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 treatment compared with control (entorhinal cortex: 3 mg/kg 11,091 ± 1,786, P < 0.001, 10 mg/kg 10,464 ± 1,896, P = 0.0002; hippocampus: 3 mg/kg – 1364 ± 408, P = 0.01, 10 mg/kg 1,110 ± 496, P = 0.03) (Fig. 8B). ANOVA also revealed significant effect of the treatment on BDNF in the prefrontal cortex [F(2, 12) = 8.652, P = 0.005] and in the entorhinal cortex [F(2, 12) = 7.207, P = 0.01]. The 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 treatment resulted in increase of BDNF expression in the prefrontal cortex (53.5 ± 13.4, P = 0.003) and the entorhinal cortex (36.6 ± 12.1, P = 0.02), with no effect on other investigated brain regions (Fig. 8C). Similarly, ANOVA revealed significant effect of the treatment on tau phosphorylation at Ser202 in the prefrontal cortex [F(2, 12) = 5.479, P = 0.02] and in the entorhinal cortex [F(2, 12) = 4.639, P = 0.03] for the three conditions. The 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 treatment resulted in decreases of tau phosphorylation at Ser202 in the prefrontal cortex (65.8 ± 21.6, P = 0.02) and the entorhinal cortex (51.4 ± 19.3, P = 0.04), with no apparent effects in the hippocampus or the cerebellum (Fig. 8D). Fig. 8E depicts phosphorylated tau Ser202 and BDNF Western blots normalized to GAPDH.

RGFP-966 Rescues AD-Like Pathology in Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Primary Neurons.

The effect of RGFP-966 on HDAC3 activity, Aβ accumulation, and tau postranslational modifications was measured in neurons derived from two patients with late-onset sporadic AD and two age-matched control individuals without dementia. We observed that 48 h of treatment with 10 μM RGFP-966 significantly decreased HDAC3 activity [t(4) = 2.081, P = 0.02] (Fig. 9A) and Aβ  accumulation [t(4) = 4.112, P = 0.01] (Fig. 9B) in induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC)-derived primary neurons derived from both AD patients. In previous studies, increased expression of acetylated tau at lysine residue 280 (K-280) has been shown in the postmortem AD brain (27). We tested the effect of RGFP-966 on tau acetylation in the patient-derived neurons and discovered that 48 h of 10 µM RGFP-966 treatment decreased K-280 tau acetylation by 72 ± 4.6% [t(10) = 6.208, P = 0.001], with no effect on total tau protein in patient-derived neurons (Fig. 9C, patient 1). We did not observe changes in tau phosphorylation at residue Ser202 and Ser396 in neurons from patient 1. Conversely, in neurons derived from patient 2, we observed a significant decrease in tau phosphorylation at residue Ser202 [66.3 ± 8.1% decrease, t(4) = 8.207, P = 0.004] and Ser396 [48 ± 18.5% decrease, t(4) = 2.393, P = 0.04], with no effect on tau acetylation and total tau (Fig. 9D, patient 2).

Discussion

The present study investigated the effect of HDAC3-mediated histone deacetylation on pathological posttranslational modifications of tau protein, accumulation of Aβ peptide, and dysregulation of AD-relevant gene expression. We report the following three key findings. First, we showed that HDAC3 is a regulator of tau phosphorylation and Aβ metabolism in cellular and animal models of AD. Second, we revealed that repeated administration of an HDAC3 inhibitor protects against impairments in recognition and spatial memory, and improves motor learning in the 3xTg-AD mouse model. Third, we demonstrated that HDAC3 is a potential target for reversal of pathological tau acetylation and phosphorylation in AD patient-derived neurons. Taken together, these results uncover a previously unknown neuroprotective mechanism induced by HDAC3 inhibition, and thus provide a potential therapeutic target for AD interventions (see SI Appendix, Fig. S19 for a schematic summary of the main findings).

Here, we observed that pharmacological inhibition and genetic silencing of HDAC3 increases the accumulation of uncleaved N- and O-glycosylated mAPP and N-glycosylated immature APP in HEK/APP  cells, suggesting that lowered HDAC3 activity results in decreased amyloidogenic APP processing. We noticed a significant increase of neuroprotective sAPPα and a significant decrease of neurotoxic sAPPβ in response to HDAC3 inhibition, which further indicates that HDAC3 plays an important role in amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic APP processing. Interestingly, we observed a significant effect of HDAC3 inhibition on APP expression and processing only at 10-μM concentration. Additionally, we noted a dose-dependent decrease in Aβ  accumulation and a dose-dependent increase in Aβ  in vitro in response to RGFP-966. Thus, it is probable that observed increase in PSEN2 gene expression, a component of intramembrane-cleaving γ-secretase complex, previously shown to selectively cleave a pool of intracellular Aβ that contains longer Aβ, might contribute to Aβ  increase in response to decreased HDAC3 activity.

The present study reveals a mechanism in which HDAC3 regulates tau phosphorylation at AD-relevant residues in a brain region-specific manner. Repeated administration of RGFP-966 decreases tau phosphorylation at Ser202 in the prefrontal and entorhinal cortex while also increasing BDNF at the same dose in the same brain regions, suggesting that HDAC3 inhibition might be an initiator and a driver of neuroprotective processes in brain regions affected by tau pathologies in AD patients. Our results are also in agreement with previous studies demonstrating that BDNF induces tau protein dephosphorylation (28), and here we report that this process is partially mediated by HDAC3 activity.

Both Aβ and tau alterations have been shown to underlie the neuronal and synaptic dysfunction in 3xTg-AD mice (29, 30). Our study reveals that repeated daily administration of RGFP-966 results in significant improvement in 3xTg-AD mice performance during hippocampal-dependent tasks, with no adverse effect on general sensorimotor skills. Additionally, we present evidence that improved memory in 3xTg-AD mice is driven by gene-expression changes induced by long-term, but not acute, administration of RGFP-966. Interestingly, repeated administration of 10 mg/kg RGFP-966 increased the recognition index in 3xTg-AD to levels comparable to those recorded in age-matched WT mice in a similar NOR paradigm (31). Others have previously showed that 12 daily intraperitoneal injections of RGFP-966 at 30 mg/kg did not rescue memory impairments of 6-mo-old double-transgenic APP/PS1 in a contextual fear memory test (32). The apparent difference between both studies may be attributed to differences in memory tasks, ages, and transgenic mouse models used, doses, and length of treatment (12 d vs. 4 mo), and dissimilar memory tasks implemented in the study. For example, at 12 mo of age, the 3xTg-AD mice present significantly more Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation than the APP/PS1 mouse model (29, 30). Nevertheless, in other reports, RGFP-966 has been shown to enhance learning and memory in WT animals in multiple behavioral tasks (33), which is consistent with our data in the 3xTg-AD mouse model. In the present study, the effect of repeated daily administration of RGFP-966 on accumulation of human Aβ and hyperphosphorylation of tau was not investigated in WT mice because these proteins are absent in WT mice, and endogenous analogous mouse proteins do not accumulate in these mice. However, it ispossible that manipulations of HDAC3 activity in vivo affect non-AD related signaling pathways and biological targets (e.g., BDNF) relevant for memory formation and consolidation in both transgenic and WT mice. Despite these limitations, the studies presented here show that targeting HDAC3 significantly affects several high-priority genes typical of AD (e.g., ABCA7, PSEN2).

It has been previously shown that acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at various lysine residues increases significantly during learning and memory formation and consolidation (21, 22). Our study revealed that H4K12 acetylation increases in response to RGFP-966 in a time-dependent process (Fig. 2A), suggesting that inhibition of HDAC3 induces structural changes in histone-associated heterochromatin, thus driving differential expression of various AD-related gene transcripts. Additionally, the association between genomic locations of H4K12ac changes and AD genetic variants has been recently described and established as the basis for a link between epigenetics and AD (34). Furthermore, we identified a subset of transcripts within the HDAC3-specific gene-expression signature (SI Appendix, Fig. S8D) that include genes relevant for memory formation and consolidation, such as BDNF. We hypothesize that genes observed to be up-regulated in both treatment groups are most sensitive to HDAC3 fluctuations. Considering the observed decrease in the expression of β-secretases (Fig. 4 E and F), and thus the decrease of amyloidogenic APP processing, the increased expression of γ-secretase catalytic subunits (APH-1, PSEN2, PEN2) may facilitate neuroprotective (i.e., nonamyloidogenic) APP processing.

Multiple studies report that familial and sporadic AD can be successfully modeled using iPSCs (23, 35, 36). Acetylated tau at lysine 280 (Ac-K280-hTau) has been observed within tau deposits in the AD brain, supporting a putative role of Ac-K280-hTau in AD-related pathologies (27, 37, 38). Here, using IPSC-derived neurons from two AD patients, we observed that RGFP-966 decreased Ac-K280-hTau in AD-iPSC neurons in patient 1 with no effect on tau phosphorylation, whereas it decreased tau hyperphosphorylation in AD-iPSC neurons in patient 2 with no effect on tau acetylation. Given that tau possesses an intrinsic autocatalytic activity that enables acetyl group transfer (39), we hypothesize that upon HDAC3 inhibition, HDAC3 is recruited to the catalytic site of tau protein, forming a tau–HDAC3 complex and turning off tau auto-acetyltransferase activity, therefore preventing tau from having excessive acetylation at lysine 280. Although it is possible that the variability between the two patients arises from gender differences, we attribute these differences to the heterogeneity of the AD population and low sample size. The described matter is also exemplified in Kondo et al. (35) and Israel et al. (36) studies, where specific sporadic and familial AD-iPSC lines did not always recapitulate their phenotypes. Larger follow-up studies are required to elucidate these findings because this topic is beyond the scope of the present report.

The HDAC family is a promising drug target and inhibitors of these enzymes are progressing well in the clinic for other indications (40, 41). However, improvements in terms of therapeutic index and toxicity are needed. One putative avenue of such improvement may be achieved by specific inhibition of HDAC isoforms that are critically involved in regulating metabolism of toxic human proteins important in AD pathobiology. In the present study, we observed that RGFP-966 decreased Aβ accumulation, tau phosphorylation, and increased expression of neuroprotective genes. Moreover, genetic silencing of HDAC3, and not HDACs 1 or 2, most closely recapitulated the effects observed with RGFP-966. Herein we propose using selective HDAC3 inhibition as a strategy to eliminate certain toxicities associated with broadly acting HDAC inhibitors, thus greatly improving drug efficacy. However, we did not investigate the effect of HDAC1, HDAC2, or HDAC3 genetic silencing in vivo, thus this line of reasoning needs further investigations.

Summary

Here, we report that HDAC3 regulates multiple pathologies relevant for AD. HDAC3 inhibition with RGFP-966 decreases pathological tau phosphorylation and acetylation, decreases Aβ protein expression in the brain and periphery, increases Aβ degradation in the periphery, and improves learning and memory in 3xTg-AD mice and normalizes a number of AD-related genes. The evidence provided in the present study indicates that HDAC3 inhibition can reverse AD-like phenotype in cells and an animal model of AD. Thus, HDAC3 inhibition holds potential for the development of novel AD therapeutics.

Cell Culture and Viability.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells stably transfected with the APP cDNA harboring the Swedish mutation KM670/671NL(HEK/APP ) were used (42, 43). Cells were cultured under standard conditions (37 °C, 5% CO , 95% air) in Advanced DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS, 25 mM Hepes, glutamax, primocin (100 μg/mL), and geneticin (250 μg/mL). HEK/APP  stably transfected with shScramble and shRNAs directed against HDAC3 (shHDAC3; Origene) were generated according to the manufacturer’s transfection protocol, using lipofectamine 2000 as a transfection reagent.

HDAC3 Activity Assay and Drug Dilutions.

Cell-free biochemical HDAC3 activity assay in response to RGFP-966 was performed at BPS Biosciences. SAHA was used as a positive control for HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8. Intermediate dilution of the drug was done in cell culture media for final DMSO concentration 0.1% (vol/vol). Cell-based HDAC3 activity was measured in HEK/APP  cells using the HDAC3 Activity Assay Kit (cat# EPI004; Sigma Aldrich). Intermediate dilution of RGFP-966 was done in 10% DMSO in HDAC assay buffer (cat# 50031; BPS). Fluorogenic HDAC3 substrate cleavage was measured at 380-nm excitation and 500-nm emission.

Histone Purification.

Total H3 and H4 histones were extracted with cell lysates using Histone Purification Mini Kit (cat# 40026; Active Motif) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were homogenized, centrifuged, and neutralized. Extracts were passed through column, washed, and precipitated using 4% perchloric acid. Histones were then washed and resuspended in distilled water.

Protein Extraction, Western Blot Analysis, and ELISA.

Total cell and tissue protein was extracted using Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (M-PER) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor (cat# 78430; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1× phosphatase inhibitor (cat# 78420; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein was loaded for gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. ELISA was used to measure Aβ , Aβ , phosphorylated tau Ser202 and Thr181.

RT-qPCR and NanoString Analysis.

Following RNA extraction from brain or cell culture with TRIzol, RNA was purified using the RNeasy Kit. cDNA was synthesized and samples were amplified for 40 cycles using Applied Biosystem Quantstudio Flex RT-qPCR System. For NanoString experiments, target RNA molecules were quantified using the nCounter analysis system (NanoString Technologies). Significant gene fold-change expression is considered ≥1.2, with P value < 0.05 and false-discovery rate < 0.05.

Coimmunoprecipitation.

Dynabeads Protein G were used for co-IP of HDAC3 and tau. Diluted anti-HDAC3 or anti-tau antibody were allowed to bind to washed Dynabeads with rotation at room temperature for 15 min. Cell lysates (150 μg) were added to the Dynabead–antibody complex and the antigen was allowed to bind to the complex. The Dynabead–antibody–antigen (Dyn-Ab-Ag) mixture was washed, eluted in 30 μL of sample buffer and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min before being loaded in a Mini-Protean TGX gel for band analysis.

Animals and Drug Administration.

The triple transgenic (APP /PS1 /Tau , 3xTg-AD) mice were purchased through the NIH- supported Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center. All experiments were approved by the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted according to specifications of the NIH as outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (44). A total of 20 9-mo-old mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle or two doses of RGFP-966 for 3 mo. RGFP-966 is a brain penetrant, selective HDAC3 inhibitor (33). At 12 mo of age, behavioral analyses were begun and throughout the course of the behavioral assays (24 d) mice continued to receive daily intraperitoneal injections of the drug or vehicle control.

IPSC Culture and Neuronal Differentiation.

iPSCs purchased from the NIGMS Human Generic Cell Repository at the Coriell Institute were maintained on Matrigel-coated flasks in mTeSR1 media. Cells were then transferred onto a Poly-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)–coated flask, grown in suspension as neurosphere precursor cells, and differentiated into neurons. Expression of pluripotency markers and efficient neuron differentiation was confirmed by fixing the cells in 4% paraformaldehyde and staining with Oct4, SSEA4, TRA-1-60, TUJ1, and MAP2.

Statistical Analysis.

Unpaired Student’s t test was used for comparisons of two means. When independent samples were evaluated at different time points, a t test with Holm–Sidak correction for multiple comparisons was used. One-way ANOVA with either Dunnett’s or Tukey post hoc analysis was used for multiple comparisons when more than two means were being compared. Repeated-measures two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc analysis was used to analyze changes in the mean of two independent variables. As a result, Tukey’s adjusted P values are presented. For follow-up, adjusted P < 0.05 was deemed to be of statistical significance. Data were graphed and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 and the R software package v3.3.3 software.

Repeated administration of RGFP-966 improves short-term recognition and spatial memory in 3xTg-AD mice. (A) Repeated administration of RGFP-966 significantly increased mean Y-maze spontaneous alternation rate in the 3- and 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 treatment groups compared with control and (B) improved RI during the NOR test in the 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 condition compared with control. (C) Mice treated with vehicle did not improve in terms of latency to find goal box between training days 1 and 4, while the latency decreased significantly in 3- and 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 treatment groups between days 1 and 3 and between days 1 and 4.

(E) RGFP-966 increased latency to fall of the rotating rod between training days 1 and 9 in 3-mg/kg and 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 conditions. Mice treated with vehicle control did not differ significantly from the 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 condition in terms of latency to fall of the rod during the first day of training. The difference to fall of the rod was statistically different at the end of training day 9 between vehicle and the 10-mg/kg RGFP-966 condition. (F) RGFP-966 increased time spent on the balance beam during the balance beam test in RGFP-966–treated mice compared with controls. (G) 3xTg-AD mice treated with 10 mg/kg RGFP-966 built better quality nests compared with vehicle-treated controls. Images exemplify poor (nesting score = 0) and good (nesting score = 4) nes-building skills. ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used for all comparisons. The graphs represent mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.001; ns, not significant; n = 5–6.

RGFP-966 reduces Aβ in the brain and plasma of 3xTg-AD mice. RGFP-966 significantly decreased Aβ  in (A) the PBMCs and in (B) the brain of 3xTg-AD mice in: the prefrontal cortex (PFC) at 3 kg/kg RGFP-966 and 10 mg/kg; in the entorhinal cortex (ERC) at 10 mg/kg; in the hippocampus (HIP) at 10 mg/kg (C). RGFP-966 increased NEP expression in the PBMCs in a dose-dependent manner with no effect of NEP expression in the brain (D). For all tests, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple-comparisons test was used. The graphs represent mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.001; n = 5–6.

RGFP-966 reduces phosphorylation of tau and increases BDNF expression in the brain of 3xTg-AD mice. (A) Phosphorylation of tau at residue Thr181 decreased significantly in the entorhinal cortex of 3xTg-AD mice following repeated administration of 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg RGFP-966. No effect was observed on tau Thr181 phosphorylation in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum as measured by ELISA. (B) Phosphorylation of tau at residue Ser396 decreased significantly following repeated administration of 3 and 10 mg/kg RGFP-966 in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, with no effect on the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, as measured by ELISA. (C) BDNF expression increased significantly following administration of 10 mg/kg RGFP-966 in the prefrontal and entorhinal cortex, with no effect on these brain regions at lower doses. (D) Phosphorylation of tau at Ser202 decreased significantly following administration of 10 mg/kg RGFP-966 in the prefrontal and entorhinal cortex, with no effect on these brain regions at lower doses. (E) Representative Western blots illustrating changes quantified in C and D in tau Ser202 phosphorylation and BDNF expression following repeated administration of RGFP-966. For all tests, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple-comparisons test was used. The graphs represent mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.001; ns, not significant; n = 5–6.

RGFP-966 rescues AD-like pathology in iPSC-derived AD-patient primary neurons. (A) RGFP-966 decreased HDAC3 activity in iPSC-AD neurons. (B) RGFP-966 decreased Aβ  in iPSC-AD neurons. (C) In response to 10 μM RGFP-966, tau acetylation at lysine 280 (Ac-tau K-280) decreased significantly in patient 1, with no effect on tau phosphorylation at Ser202 and Ser396. (D) In response to 10 μM RGFP-966, tau phosphorylation at Ser202 and Ser396 decreased significantly in patient 2, with no effect on tau acetylation. Two-tailed unpaired t-test was used for analysis. The graphs represent mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.001; n = 6.
