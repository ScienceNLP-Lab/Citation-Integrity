XBP1 Promotes Triple Negative Breast Cancer By Controlling the HIF1 α Pathway

Abstract

Cancer cells induce a set of adaptive response pathways to survive in the face of stressors due to inadequate vascularization1. One such adaptive pathway is the unfolded protein (UPR) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response mediated in part by the ER-localized transmembrane sensor IRE12  3. Previous studies report UPR activation in various human tumors4-6, but XBP1's role in cancer progression in mammary epithelial cells is largely unknown. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a form of breast cancer in which tumor cells do not express the genes for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her2/neu, is a highly aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options7, 8. Here, we report that XBP1 is activated in TNBC and plays a pivotal role in the tumorigenicity and progression of this human breast cancer subtype. In breast cancer cell line models, depletion of XBP1 inhibited tumor growth and tumor relapse and reduced the CD44high/CD24low population. Hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF)1α is known to be hyperactivated in TNBCs 9, 10. Genome-wide mapping of the XBP1 transcriptional regulatory network revealed that XBP1 drives TNBC tumorigenicity by assembling a transcriptional complex with HIF1α that regulates the expression of HIF1α targets via the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. Analysis of independent cohorts of patients with TNBC revealed a specific XBP1 gene expression signature that was highly correlated with HIF1α and hypoxia-driven signatures and that strongly associated with poor prognosis. Our findings reveal a key function for the XBP1 branch of the UPR in TNBC and imply that targeting this pathway may offer alternative treatment strategies for this aggressive subtype of breast cancer.

We determined UPR activation status in several breast cancer cell lines (BCCL). XBP1 expression was readily detected in both luminal and basal-like BCCL, but was higher in the latter which consist primarily of TNBC cells and also in primary TNBC patient samples (Fig. 1a, b). PERK but not ATF6 was also activated (Extended Data 1a) and transmission electron microscopy revealed more abundant and dilated ER in multiple TNBC cell lines (Extended Data 1b). These data reveal a state of basal ER stress in TNBC cells.

XBP1 silencing impaired soft agar colony forming ability and invasiveness (Extended Data 1c) of multiple TNBC cell lines, indicating that XBP1 regulates TNBC anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness. We next used an orthotopic xenograft mouse model with inducible expression of two XBP1 shRNAs in MDA-MB-231 cells. Tumor growth and metastasis to lung were significantly inhibited by XBP1 shRNAs (Fig. 1c-e, Extended Data 1d-g). This was not due to altered apoptosis (Caspase 3), cell proliferation (Ki67) or hyperactivation of IRE1 and other UPR branches (Fig. 1e, Extended Data 1h, i). Instead, XBP1 depletion impaired angiogenesis as evidenced by the presence of fewer intratumoral blood vessels (CD31 staining) (Fig. 1e). Subcutaneous xenograft experiments using two other TNBC cell lines confirmed our findings (Extended Data 1j, k). Importantly, XBP1 silencing in a patient-derived TNBC xenograft model (BCM-2147) significantly decreased tumor incidence (Fig. 1f, Extended Data 1l, m).

TNBC patients have the highest rate of relapse within 1-3 years despite adjuvant chemotherapy7, 8. To examine XBP1's effect on tumor relapse following chemotherapeutic treatment, we treated MDA-MB-231 xenograft bearing mice with doxorubicin and XBP1 shRNA. Strikingly, combination treatment not only blocked tumor growth but also inhibited or delayed tumor relapse (Fig. 2a).

Tumor cells expressing CD44high/CD24low have been shown to mediate tumor relapse in some instances11-13. To test whether XBP1 targeted the CD44high/CD24low population, we examined the mammosphere-forming ability of cells derived from treated tumors (day 20). Mammosphere formation was increased in doxorubicin treated tumor cells, while tumors treated with doxorubicin plus XBP1 shRNA displayed substantially reduced mammosphere formation (Fig. 2b), a finding confirmed using another chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel (Extended Data 2a, b). Hypoxia activates the UPR, and XBP1 knockdown also dramatically reduced mammosphere formation in hypoxic conditions (Extended Data. 2b). Furthermore, CD44 expression was reduced in XBP1-depleted tumors (Extended Data 2c).

To further interrogate XBP1's effect on CD44high/CD24low cell function, we used mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) carrying an inducible Src oncogene (ER-Src), where v-Src is fused with the estrogen receptor ligand binding domain14. Tamoxifen (TAM) treatment results in neoplastic transformation and gain of a CD44high/CD24low population that has been previously associated with tumor-initiating properties15. In transformed MCF10A-ER-Src cells, XBP1 splicing was increased in CD44high/CD24low population (Fig. 2c), while XBP1 silencing reduced the CD44high/CD24low fraction (Extended Data 2d, e) and markedly suppressed mammosphere formation (Extended Data 2f), phenotypes not attributable to a direct effect of XBP1 on cell viability (Extended Data 2g, h). Furthermore, limiting dilution experiments demonstrated loss of tumor-seeding ability in XBP1-depleted cells (Fig. 2d). CD44high/CD24low cells sorted from TNBC patient samples confirmed increased XBP1 splicing and other UPR markers, and XBP1 silencing impaired mammosphere-forming ability (Fig. 2e, f, Extended Data 3a). Conversely, XBP1s overexpression in CD44low/CD24high cells resulted in gain of mammosphere-forming ability and increased resistance to doxorubicin treatment (Extended Data 3b, c). Strikingly, patient derived CD44low/CD24high cells overexpressing XBP1s, but not control parental cells, initiated tumor formation in immunodeficient mice (Extended Data 3d, e). These data establish a critical role of XBP1 in CD44high/CD24low cells within TNBC.

ChIP-seq and motif analysis of XBP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells revealed statistically significant enrichment of both the HIF1α and XBP1 motifs (Fig. 3a, Extended Data 4a), suggesting frequent colocalization of HIF1α and XBP1 to the same regulatory elements. HIF1α is hyperactivated in TNBCs, required for the maintenance of CD44high/CD24low cells9, 10, 16, 17 and regulated in response to microenvironmental oxygen levels. XBP1 ChIP-seq was therefore also performed in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells cultured under hypoxia and glucose deprivation conditions for 24h. Exposure to these stressors increased XBP1 splicing, resulting in a corresponding increase in signal intensity (Extended Data 4b-f) and further enrichment of HIF1α motifs in TNBC (Fig. 3a), but interestingly not in luminal breast cancer cells (Extended Data 4g).

HIF1α motif enrichment in the XBP1 ChIP-seq dataset suggested that XBP1 and HIF1α might interact within the same transcriptional complex. Co-IP experiments revealed a physical interaction of HIF1α, but not HIF2α, with XBP1 in 293T cells co-expressing HIF1 and XBP1s cultured under hypoxic conditions, also observed with endogenous proteins in two TNBC cell lines: MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T (Fig. 3b, Extended Data 4h-j). Subcellular fractionation revealed that this interaction occurs in the nucleus, and that unspliced XBP1u protein was not detectable (Extended Data 4k, l). GST pull-down experiments showed that HIF1α interacts with the XBP1s N-terminus b-zip domain (Extended Data 4m, n).

We next established that XBP1 and HIF1α co-occupied several well-known HIF1α targets using ChIP-qPCR (Extended Data 5a-c). ChIP-re-ChIP assays using anti-XBP1s followed by anti-HIF1α antibodies confirmed that XBP1s and HIF1α simultaneously co-occupy these common targets (Extended Data. 5d). DNA-pull down assays with an HIF1α18 specific probe precipitated XBP1s in MDA-MB-231 nuclear extracts under hypoxia, indicating their presence in the same complex (Extended Data 5e, f). XBP1 depletion by two independent shRNA constructs dramatically reduced hypoxia response element (HRE) luciferase activity under hypoxia (Fig. 3c). Conversely, XBP1s expression dose-dependently transactivated the HRE reporter (Extended Data 5g, h), confirming that XBP1 augments HIF1α activity.

When we profiled the differential transcriptome induced by XBP1 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells, gene set enrichment analysis identified significant enrichment of HIF1α mediated hypoxia response pathway genes (Fig. 3d, Extended Data 6a). XBP1 depletion downregulated HIF1α targets VEGFA, PDK1, GLUT1, and DDIT4 expression in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Extended Data 6b), and these results were validated in breast cancer xenografts (Fig. 3e) and Hs578T cells (Extended Data 6c). However, XBP1 depletion in luminal tumors did not affect these targets (Extended Data 6d).

To further explore the consequences of this cooperation, we examined how XBP1 or HIF1α loss affected the transcription of common target genes. We found that high occupancy by XBP1 was associated with increased occurrence of the HIF1α motif across the genome in TNBC (Fig. 3f). While XBP1 depletion had no immediate effect on HIF1α expression, it substantially attenuated concurrent HIF1α and RNA polymerase II occupancy (Extended Data 6e-g, Fig. 3g). Similarly, XBP1 and RNA Polymerase II occupancy at co-bound sites was likewise reduced in the absence of HIF1α under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3h, Extended Data 6h-l). These results indicate that the assembly of the XBP1-HIF1α complex on target promoters is crucial for their transcription, via the recruitment of RNA polymerase II.

To establish whether HIF1α contributes to XBP1's function in TNBC, we performed rescue experiments using a HA-tagged constitutively activated hydroxylation-mutant HIF1α construct (HA-HIF1α dPA: P402A/P564A). XBP1 splicing was not directly regulated by HIF1α (Extended Data 7a-c). Enforced overexpression of HIF1α dPA in XBP1 depleted cells restored expression of HIF1α targets and rescued anchorage independent growth, mammosphere-forming ability, angiogenesis and in vivo tumor growth (Fig. 3i; Extended Data 7d-h). Conversely, HIF1α silencing in XBP1s overexpressing cells dramatically compromised their ability to sustain mammosphere formation (Extended Data 7i). Hypoxia is a physiological UPR inducer in cancer19and XBP1s co-localizes with hypoxia marker CA9 in tumors20. Our experiments demonstrate that XBP1 functions to sustain the hypoxia response via regulating the HIF1α transcriptional program (Extended Data 8), which ensures maximum HIF activity and adaptive responses to the cytotoxic microenvironment of solid tumors.

Integrated analysis of XBP1 ChIP-seq data and gene expression profiles identified 96 genes directly bound and up-regulated by XBP1. This gene set was defined as the XBP1 signature (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 1). Its expression was highly correlated with hypoxia-driven signatures in TNBC (Pearson's correlation coefficient=0.61; p=2.28×10-60), but not in ER+ breast cancer patients (coefficient=0.03; p=0.64) (Extended Data 9a, b). Survival analysis using an aggregate breast cancer dataset for 193 TNBC patient samples21 demonstrated that tumors with an elevated XBP1 signature displayed shorter relapse-free survival (Log-rank test, p =0.00677) (Fig. 4b). Cox regression analysis showed that association of the signature with relapse free survival remained significant after controlling for tumor size, grade and chemotherapy treatment (p=0.00453, Supplementary Table 2). These findings were validated in a separate cohort of 190 TNBC patients (Fig. 4c). Importantly, the XBP1 signature did not correlate with clinical outcome of ER+ breast cancer patients (p=0.553) (Extended Data 9c), indicating its specific prognostic value for TNBC. Expression of the XBP1-regulated HIF1α program was also associated with decreased relapse free survival only in TNBC (p=0.00911) (Fig. 4d, Extended Data 9d). Although XBP1 silencing also affects luminal breast cancer growth, it does so via a mechanism not involving HIF1α (Extended Data 10, 4g, 6d).

In conclusion, we uncover a key function for XBP1 in the tumorigenicity, progression and recurrence of TNBC and identified XBP1's control of the HIF1α transcriptional program as the major mechanism. XBP1 pathway activation correlates with poor patient survival in TNBC patients implying that UPR inhibitors in combination with standard chemotherapy may improve the effectiveness of anti-tumor therapies.

METHODS

Cell Culture And Treatments

The non-transformed breast cell line MCF10A contains an integrated fusion of the v-Src oncoprotein with the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER-Src). These cells were grown in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 5% donor horse serum (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) (R&D systems), 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 100 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), with the addition of puromycin (Sigma). Src induction and cellular transformation was achieved by treatment with 1 μM 4-OH tamoxifen (TAM), typically for 36h as described previously14.

All breast cancer cells were from ATCC cultured according to Neve et al.24. Following retroviral or lentiviral infection, cells were maintained in the presence of puromycin (2 μg/ml) (Sigma). For all hypoxia experiments, cells were maintained in an anaerobic chamber (Coy laboratory) with 0.1% O . For glucose deprivation experiments, cells were maintained in DMEM without glucose medium (Gibco) with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 50 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin.

ChIP and ChIP-seq

ChIP was performed with XBP1 antibody (Biolegend, 619502); HIF1α antibody (Abcam, ab2185), RNA Polymerase II antibody (Millipore, 05-623) or GST antibody (santa cruz, sc-33613) as described25. See list of primers used in Fig. 3 (Supplementary Table 3). ChIP-seq libraries were prepared using ChIP-Seq DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). XBP1 ChIP-seq peaks were first identified using MACS package with a p-value cutoff of 1×10-7 on individual replicate. Correlations of the ChIP-seq signal in the union peak regions between two biological replicates are: MDA-MB-231_untreated: 0.97 (p<2.2×10-16); MDA-MB-231_HG: 0.96 (p<2.2×10-16); Hs578T_HG: 0.98 (p<2.2×10-16); T47D_HG: 0.99 (p<2.2×10-16). The correlations were calculated by cor.test() function in R (http://www.r-project.org/). The highly confident common peaks between replicates were further identified using an irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) cutoff of 20%. IDR is a statistical measure that assesses the consistency of the rank orders of the common ChIP-seq peaks between two replicates. The methodology and details of the implementation of IDR can be found in26.

Tumor Initiation Assay Using Patient-Derived Tumors

Tumorgraft line BCM-2147 was derived by transplantation of a fresh patient breast tumor biopsy (ER-PR-HER2-) into the cleared mammary gland fat pad of immune-compromised SCID/Beige mice and retained the patient biomarker status and morphology across multiple transplant generations in mice. To overcome the challenge of limited cell viability by dissociation of solid tumors, 10 mg tumor pieces containing 1.3 × 105 cells were transplanted with basal membrane extract (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). The cell number was calculated as average cell yield 1.3 × 107 cells/gram × 0.01 gram = 1.3 × 105 cells. For sustained siRNA release in the first two weeks following transplantation, porous silicon particles loaded with siRNA (scrambled control or XBP1 siRNA) packaged in nanoliposomes were injected into the tumor tissue with basal membrane extract at the time of transplantation. Scrambled sequence [5’ CGAAGUGUGUGUGUGUGGCdTdT 3’]; XBP1 siRNA sequence [5’ CACCCUGAAUUCAUUGUCUdTdT 3’]. Two weeks post-transplantation, nanoliposomes containing siRNA (15mg per mouse) were injected I.V. twice weekly for 8 weeks. Mice were monitored thrice weekly for tumor development, and tumors were calipered and recorded using LABCAT Tumor Analysis and Tracking System v6.4 (Innovative Programming Associates, Inc., Princeton, NJ). Tumor incidence is reported at 10 weeks post-transplantation. The human patient samples were procured and utilized according to approved IRB protocols for research in human subjects.

Invasion Assay

We performed invasion assays according to14. Invasion of the matrigel was conducted by using standardized conditions with BD BioCoat growth factor reduced MATRIGEL invasion chambers (PharMingen). Assays were conducted according to manufacturer's protocol, by using 5% horse serum (GIBCO) and 20 ng/ml EGF (R&D Systems) as chemoattractants.

Colony Formation Assay

1×105 breast cancer cells were mixed 4:1 (v/v) with 2.0% agarose in growth medium for a final concentration of 0.4% agarose. The cell mixture was plated on top of a solidified layer of 0.8% agarose in growth medium. Cells were fed every 6 to 7 days with growth medium containing 0.4% agarose. The number of colonies was counted after 20 days. The experiment was repeated three times and the statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test.

Subcutaneous Xenograft Experiments

MCF10A ER-Src TAM-treated (36h) cells or MDA-MB-436 or HBL-100 breast cancer cells were injected subcutaneously in the right flank of athymic nude mice (Charles River Laboratories). Tumor growth was monitored every five days and tumor volumes were calculated by the equation V(mm3)=axb2/2, where a is the largest diameter and b is the perpendicular diameter. When the tumors reached a size of ~100mm3 (15 days) mice were randomly distributed into 3 groups (5 mice/group). The first group was used as control (non-treated), the second group was intratumorally treated with shCtrl and the third group was intratumorally treated with shXBP1. For each injection 10ug of shRNA was mixed with 2ul of vivo-jetPEI (polyethylenimine) reagent (cat. no 201-50G, PolyPlus Transfection SA) in a final volume of 100ul. These treatments were repeated every five days for 4 cycles (days 15, 20, 25, 30). In addition, in vivo dilution xenotransplantation assays were performed in NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ-/- mice. Mice were evaluated on a weekly basis for tumor formation. All mice were maintained in accordance with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee procedures and guidelines.

Purification of CD44high/CD24low and CD44low/CD24high Cells From Patients with TNBC

Five human invasive triple negative ductal carcinoma tissues (stage III) were used in our experiments15. Immunomagnetic purification of CD44high/CD24low   CD44low/CD24high cells was performed according to Shipitsin et al27. Briefly, the breast tissues were minced into small pieces (1mm) using a sterile razor blade. The tissues were digested with 2mg/ml collagenase I (C0130, Sigma) and 2mg/ml hyalurinidase (H3506, Sigma) in 37°C for 3h. Cells were filtered, washed with PBS and followed by Percoll gradient centrifugation. The first purification step was to remove the immune cells by immunomagnetic purification using an equal mix of CD45 (leukocytes), CD15 (granulocytes), CD14 (monocytes) and CD19 (B cells) Dynabeads (Invitrogen). The second purification step was to isolate fibroblasts from the cell population by using CD10 beads for magnetic purification. The third step was to isolate the endothelial cells by using an “endothelial cocktail” of beads (CD31 BD Pharmingen cat no. 555444, CD146 P1H12 MCAM BD Pharmingen cat no. 550314, CD105 Abcam cat no. Ab2529, Cadherin 5 Immunotech cat no. 1597, and CD34 BD Pharmingen cat no. 555820). In the final step the CD44high cells were purified from the remaining cell population using CD44 beads. These cells were sorted for CD44high/CD24low cells, CD24high cells were also purified using CD24 beads. These cells were sorted for CD44low/CD24high cells. These cell populations were sorted again with CD44 antibody (FITC-conjugated) (555478, BD Biosciences) and CD24 antibody (PE-conjugated) (555428, BD Biosciences) in order to increase their purity (>99.2% in all cases).

Gene Expression Microarray Analysis

MDA-MB-231 cells infected with control shRNA or XBP1 shRNA lentiviruses grown in glucose free medium were treated in 0.1% O  in a hypoxia chamber for 24h. Total RNA was extracted by using RNeasy mini kit with on column DNase digestion (QIAGEN). Biotin labeled cRNA was prepared from 1 μg of total RNA, fragmented, and hybridized to Affymetrix human U133 plus 2.0 expression array. All Gene expression microarray data were normalized and summarized using RMA. The differentially expressed genes were identified using Limma (q  10%).

Motif Analysis

Flanking sequences around the summits (±300 bp ) of the top 1,000 XBP1 binding sites were extracted and the repetitive regions in these flanking sequences were masked. The consensus sequence motifs were derived using Seqpos.

XBP1 Signature Generation

The XBP1 signature was generated by integrative analysis of of ChIP-seq and differential expression data using the method as previously described28. Briefly, we first calculated the regulatory potential for a given gene, Sg, as the sum of the nearby binding sites weighted by the distance from each site to the TSS of the gene:  , where k is the number of binding sites within 100 kb of gene g and Δi is the distance between site i and the TSS of gene g normalized to 100 kb (e.g., 0.5 for a 50 kb distance). We then applied the Breitling's rank product method to combine regulatory potentials with differential expression t-values to rank all genes based on the probability that they were XBP1 targets. Only genes with at least one binding site within 100 kb from its TSS and a differential expression t-value above the 75th percentile were considered. The FDR of XBP1 target prediction was estimated by permutation. At a FDR cutoff of 20% and differential expression fold-change cutoff of 1.5, we obtained 96 up-regulated genes (HUGO gene symbol) as direct targets of XBP1.

Survival Analysis

We performed survival analysis using an aggregated compendium of gene expression profiles of 383 TNBC samples from 21 breast cancer datasets21. Of the 96 XBP1 signature genes, 70 genes had corresponding probes in this dataset. To avoid potential confounding factors such as heterogeneity among the samples, we randomly split all 383 TNBC samples into two datasets with similar size (193 and 190 cases) and evaluated the correlation of the XBP1 gene signature with relapse free survival using these two datasets respectively. We separated patients into two subgroups: one with higher and the other with lower expression of the XBP1 signature. The subgroup classification was performed as described previously29. Patients were considered to have a higher XBP1 signature if they had average expression values of all the genes in the XBP1 signature above the 58th percentile29. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed and log-rank test was used to assess the statistical significance of survival difference between these 2 groups. We also performed multivariate Cox regression analysis to evaluate the significance of the association between XBP1 signature and relapse-free survival in the presence of other clinical variables including tumor stage, tumor grade and the treatment with chemotherapy. A similar analysis was performed for the HIF pathway signature (VEGFA, PDK1, DDIT4, SLC2A1, KDM3A, NDRG1, PFKFB3, PIK3CA, RORB, CREBBP, PIK3CB, HK2 and EGLN1). Similar to the analysis for TNBC, the survival analysis was performed for ER+ breast cancer using gene expression profiles and clinical annotations of 209 ER+ breast cancer patients30.

Virus Production and Infection

The Phoenix packaging cell line was used for the generation of ecotropic retroviruses and the 293T packaging cell line was used for lentiviral amplification. In brief, viruses were collected 48 and 72 hr after transfection, filtered, and used for infecting cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene prior to drug selection with puromycin (2 μg/ml). shRNA constructs were generated by The Broad Institute. Targeting of GFP mRNA with shRNA served as a control. Optimal targeting sequences identified for human XBP1 were 5′-GACCCAGTCATGTTCTTCAAA-3′, and 5′- GAACAGCAAGTGGTAGATTTA-3′, respectively. Knockdown efficiency was assessed by real-time PCR for XBP1.

Luciferase Assay

For Fig. 3f, MDA-MB-231 cells were co-transfected with 3×HRE luciferase (3×HRE-Luc) plasmid and XBP1s overexpression construct or control vector by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). A Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-CMV from Promega) was co-transfected as an internal control. Cells were harvested 36 hr after transfection, and the luciferase activities of the cell lysates were measured by using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). For Fig. 3e, MDA-MB-231 cells were co-transfected with 3×HRE-Luc and two inducible XBP1 shRNA construct (in pLKO-Tet-On vector) or control shRNA construct by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were treated with doxycycline for 48h and hypoxia for 24h before the luciferase activities of the cell lysates were measured.

Statistical analysis

The significance of differences between treatment groups was measured with a Student's t-test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Coimmunoprecipitation

Transfected cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol with protease inhibitor cocktail) for 1 hour. M2 beads (Sigma) were incubated with the whole cell extracts at 4°C for overnight. The beads were washed with cell lysis buffer four times. Finally, the beads were boiled in 2x sample buffer for 10 minutes. The eluents were analyzed by Western blot. Nuclear extracts were used to perform the endogenous co-IP. Briefly, 5 mg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 5 μg of anti-HIF1α antibody (Novus Biologicals, NB100-479) at 4°C for overnight. The protein complexes were precipitated by addition of protein A agarose beads (Roche) with incubation for 4 hr at 4°C. The beads were washed four times and boiled for 5 min in 2x sample buffer.

Real-time PCR analysis

1 μg of RNA sample was reverse-transcribed to form cDNA, which was subjected to SYBR Green based real-time PCR analysis. Primers used for β-actin forward: 5’-CCTGTACGCCAACACAGTGC-3’ and reverse 5’- ATACTCCTGCTT GCTGATCC-3’; for VEGFA forward 5’- CACACAGGATGGCTTGAAGA -3’ and reverse 5’- AGGGCAGAATCATCACGAAG-3’; for PDK1 forward 5’-GGAGGTCTCAACACGAGGTC -3’ and reverse 5’- GTTCATGTCACGCTGGGTAA -3’; for GLUT1 forward 5’- TGGACCCATGTCTGGTTGTA -3’ and reverse 5’-ATGGAGCCCAGCAGCAA -3’; for JMJD1A forward 5’-TCAGGTGACTTTCGTTCAGC-3’ and reverse 5’- CACCGACGTTACCAAGAAGG-3’; for DDIT4 forward 5’- CATCAGGTTGGCACACAAGT-3’ and reverse 5’-CCTGGAGAGCTCGGACTG-3’; for MCT4 forward 5’-TACATGTAGACGTGGGTCGC – 3’ and reverse 5’ CTGCAGTTCGAGGTGCTCAT – 3’; for XBP1 splicing forward 5’- CCTGGTTGCTGAAGAGGAGG-3’ and reverse 5’-CCATGGGGAGATGTTCTGGAG -3’; for XBP1 total forward 5’-AGGAGTTAAGACAGCGCTTGGGGATGGAT-3’ and reverse 5’-CTGAATCTGAAGAGTCAATACCGCCAGAAT-3’;

ChIP-re-ChIP

XBP1 antibody was cross-linked to protein G-Sepharose beads using dimethylpimelimidate to prevent the leaching of antibody during sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) elution. The beads were then incubated with chromatin extracts overnight. Subsequently, the beads were washed and eluted with 1% SDS elution buffer at 37°C for 45 minutes. The eluate was diluted to a final SDS concentration of 0.1% and incubated with fresh antibody-bound beads for the second immunoprecipitation (IP). For the final round of IP, washed beads were eluted with 1% SDS elution buffer at 68°C for 30 minutes. Eluate was decrosslinked in the presence of pronase and heated at 68°C for 6 hours, and DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction.

Glutathione S-Transferase Pulldown Assay

Various deletion fragments of XBP1s were cloned into pET42b (Novagen). The plasmids were transformed into BL21 Escherichia coli. The XBP1s proteins were expressed and purified with glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose beads (GE healthcare). The purified proteins were bound to GSH beads and incubated with HIF1α-overexpressed cell lysates for 2 hours in 4°C. The beads were washed six times with cell lysis buffer. The eluents were analyzed by Western blot.

DNA-binding assay

Nuclear protein (150 μg) was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a biotinylated probe containing wild-type or mutated HIF1α binding site plus streptavidin-dynabeads (Invitrogen) in binding buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1 mg/ml of BSA and 20 μg/ml of poly(dI:dC), plus protease inhibitors). Streptavidin-beads were washed in binding buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblot for XBP1s or HIF1α.

Transmission Electron Microscopy

Cells were washed with serum-free media then fixed with a modified Karmovsky's fix of 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 4% parafomaldehye and 0.02% picric acid in 0.1M sodium caocdylate buffer at pH7.2. Following a secondary fixation in 1% osmium tetroxide, 1.5% potassium ferricyanide, samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, and embedded in situ in an epon analog resin. En face ultrathin sections were cut on a Leica Ultractu S Ultramicrotome (Leica). Sections were collected on copper grids and further contrasted with lead citrate and viewed on a JEM 1400 electron microscope (JEOL, USA, Inc., Peabody, MA) operated at 100 kV. Digital images were captured on a Veleta 2K x 2K CCD camera (Olympus-SIS, Germany).

Caspase 3 ELISA Assay

Quantification of cleaved Caspase-3 activity was performed using the PathScan Cleaved Caspase-3 (Asp175) sandwich ELISA kit (#7190, Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

Immunohistochemical Staining
