Public health significance of zoonotic  Cryptosporidium  species in wildlife: Critical insights into better drinking water management

Abstract

Cryptosporidium is an enteric parasite that is transmitted via the faecal–oral route, water and food. Humans, wildlife and domestic livestock all potentially contribute Cryptosporidium to surface waters. Human encroachment into natural ecosystems has led to an increase in interactions between humans, domestic animals and wildlife populations. Increasing numbers of zoonotic diseases and spill over/back of zoonotic pathogens is a consequence of this anthropogenic disturbance. Drinking water catchments and water reservoir areas have been at the front line of this conflict as they can be easily contaminated by zoonotic waterborne pathogens. Therefore, the epidemiology of zoonotic species of Cryptosporidium in free-ranging and captive wildlife is of increasing importance. This review focuses on zoonotic Cryptosporidium species reported in global wildlife populations to date, and highlights their significance for public health and the water industry.

Introduction

More than 15% of the world's population has no access to safe drinking water (Cauchie et al., 2014). Waterborne parasitic protozoan diseases with worldwide distribution, result in four billion cases of diarrhoea, 1.6 million deaths annually (www.who.int) and 62.5 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) worldwide (Wright and Gundry, 2009, WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality., 2011). Yet, despite the latest advances made in water treatment measures, protecting drinking water supplies against waterborne pathogens remains by far, as one of the most challenging concerns for the entire drinking water supply chain worldwide (Cotruva et al., 2004, Betancourt and Rose, 2004, Thompson and Smith, 2011, Plutzer, 2013, Burnet et al., 2014). In response to this, in 2009, the World Health Organization has developed guidelines for water suppliers on how to implement “Water Safety Plans” (WSPs), in the hope of halving the number of people without safe access to drinking water by the end of 2015 (WHO, 2009).

In less developed countries, lack of basic infrastructure for providing safe drinking water is considered a major cause of poor water quality which contributes to the spread of endemic/epidemic waterborne diseases. However, even in industrialized nations, highly advanced infrastructures are not yet a protective factor against outbreaks (Cummins et al., 2010, Smith and Nichols, 2010, Castro-Hermida et al., 2010, Burnet et al., 2014, Smolders et al., 2015). This appears to be largely due to a lack of knowledge about the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of waterborne pathogens (e.g. from animals ranging within the catchments) which leads to poor management practices for drinking water catchments (Gormley et al., 2011, Castro-Hermida et al., 2010).

Waterborne parasitic protozoans are responsible for the majority of waterborne outbreaks worldwide, with socio-economic impacts even in developed countries (Cotruva et al., 2004, Pond, 2005, Baldursson and Karanis, 2011, Cauchie et al., 2014). Of these, Cryptosporidium was the etiological agent in 60.3% (120) of the waterborne protozoan parasitic outbreaks that have been reported worldwide between 2004 and 2010 (Baldursson and Karanis, 2011). For the global water industry, therefore, Cryptosporidium represents the major public health concern, as its oocyst (the environmentally stable stage) is able to survive and penetrate routine wastewater treatment and is resistant to inactivation by commonly used drinking water disinfectants (Fayer et al., 2001, Baldursson and Karanis, 2011, Burnet et al., 2014). As a result of these waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis, Cryptosporidium testing in source or finished water is now mandatory in most industrialised nations. For example, the U.S. EPA, working with the U.S. public water supply industry, developed and implemented the Long-term Stage 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT2ESWTR), known as LT2 to control Cryptosporidium in public water supplies (US EPA, 2006). LT2 requires all public water suppliers using surface water sources and serving populations >10,000 to monitor their sources for Cryptosporidium by analysing at least 24 consecutive monthly samples. In the UK, the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) requires that water companies carry out risk assessments on all their water supply sites to ascertain the level of risk Cryptosporidium poses to the final treated water quality. Those at high risk need additional treatment (in the form of properly controlled coagulation/flocculation filtration systems or membrane or UV treatment systems). The UK regulations also require companies to design and continuously operate adequate treatment and disinfection. A proven failure to comply with this is now an offence (DWI, 2010).

Table 1 Valid Cryptosporidium species confirmed by molecular analysis.. Cryptosporidium species are able to infect a broad range of hosts including humans, domestic and wild animals (mammals, birds, fish, marsupials, reptiles and amphibians) worldwide (Table 1), causing asymptomatic or mild to severe gastrointestinal disease in their host species (Monis and Thompson, 2003, Hunter et al., 2007, Ryan and Power, 2012, Xiao, 2010, Kváč et al., 2014a, Ryan et al., 2014). Current treatment options for cryptosporidiosis are limited and only one drug, nitazoxanide (NTZ), has been approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This drug, however, exhibits only moderate clinical efficacy in children and immunocompetent people, and none in people with HIV (Abubakar et al., 2007, Amadi et al., 2009, Pankiewicz et al., 2015, Gargala, 2008, Rossignol, 2010).

Oocyst transport to surface water can occur by deposition of manure directly in the water or surface runoff. Hence, humans, wildlife and domestic livestock all potentially contribute Cryptosporidium contamination to water systems (Ryan et al., 2014). Identification of the sources/carriers of human pathogenic strains is therefore essential for accurate risk assessment and optimal catchment management. However, most studies to date have focused on humans and the potential role of livestock in the epidemiology of zoonotic cryptosporidiosis, while wildlife as a potential risk factor to source water, has only been studied opportunistically. Thus, the aim of this review is to summarize available information about molecular characterisation of Cryptosporidium species in wildlife with emphasis on the public health significance of zoonotic species.

Taxonomy and zoonotic potential of Cryptosporidium species

The application of advanced molecular techniques has led to an improved taxonomy and systematics, and better understanding of Cryptosporidium phylogeny (Ryan et al., 2014). Given the morphological similarity of oocysts by microscopy, these advances are crucial for confident identification, description of host/parasite intractions and ultimately accurate risk assessment. Currently, 29 Cryptosporidium species have been recognised as valid (Table 1), including the recently described C. rubeyi in ground-dwelling squirrels (Spermophilus sp.) (Li et al., 2015a). More than 17 species have been identified in humans (Table 1). Of these, C. parvum and C. hominis are by far the most common species reported in humans worldwide (Xiao, 2010, Ryan and Xiao, 2014) and have been responsible for the majority of waterborne outbreaks typed to date with the exception of a waterborne outbreak in the UK caused by C. cuniculus from rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) (Chalmers et al., 2009, Xiao, 2010, Ryan et al., 2014).

The most widely molecular markers used for typing of Cryptosporidium isolates are the 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) gene and the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene. The latter locus encodes a precursor protein, that is cleaved to produce mature cell surface glycoproteins (gp45/gp40 and gp15) implicated in zoite attachment to, and invasion of enterocytes (Xiao, 2010, Ryan et al., 2014). Most of the genetic heterogeneity in the gp60 gene is the variation in the number of a tri-nucleotide repeat (TCA, TCG or TCT) in the 5′ end (gp40) of the coding region, although extensive sequence polymorphism is also present in the rest of the gene. The repeats are used to define the subtype families within a species, whereas the remaining polymorphic sites are used to identify subtypes within a subtype family (Ryan et al., 2014).

Wildlife associated outbreaks and water contamination

Relatively little is known about the distribution of zoonotic and non-zoonotic Cryptosporidium species and subtypes in wildlife populations (Appelbeea et al., 2005, Ziegler et al., 2007, Ryan et al., 2014). Conclusive molecular evidence, linking contamination of water supplies by wild animals in catchments with outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in human populations is scant. However, a recent waterborne outbreak in the UK caused by C. cuniculus from rabbits has highlighted the importance of wildlife in the dissemination of Cryptosporidium to drinking water sources and the associated human health risk (Chalmers et al., 2009, Elwin et al., 2012).

A wide range of Cryptosporidium species and genotypes have been identified in drinking source water, storm water runoff, stream sediment, wastewater and seawater in various geographic locations including C. hominis, C. parvum, C. andersoni, C. muris, C. cuniculus, C. meleagridis and C. canis as well as various wildlife adapted genotypes and unidentified “environmental sequences” which probably represent as yet unidentified wildlife genotypes and which also highlight the potential for contamination of water supplies by wildlife (Zhou et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2005, Yang et al., 2008, Jellison et al., 2004, Nichols et al., 2010, Koompapong and Sukthana, 2012, Van Dyke et al., 2012, Xiao et al., 2012, Galván et al., 2014, Li et al., 2014, Mahmoudi et al., 2015). For example, studies on Cryptosporidium contamination from wildlife from New York watersheds have shown that wildlife are the major source of Cryptosporidium in protected drinking source water, including some emerging human pathogens such as C. ubiquitum and chipmunk genotype I (Jiang et al., 2005, Feng et al., 2007).

Cryptosporidium in mammals

Table 2 Cryptosporidium species and genotypes identified by molecular tools in wild terrestrial mammals and their zoonotic importance.. Due to the morphological similarity of Cryptosporidium oocysts from different host species, initial findings of Cryptosporidium infections in wild animals were assumed to be due to C. parvum leading to an overestimation of the potential role of wildlife as reservoirs of human disease (Appelbeea et al., 2005). However, with the assistance of advanced molecular techniques, many of these species were identified as host-adapted genotypes (Table 2). Both wild terrestrial and marine mammals have been studied as potential reservoirs for human-infectious Cryptosporidium species and genotypes using molecular tools (Table 2). The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in wild placental mammal hosts has been reported in detail in a recent review (Feng, 2010) and varies widely between mammalian hosts.

Cryptosporidium hominis

Although humans are the major host species for C. hominis, it has been reported in a number of wildlife hosts including a dugong and non-human primates (Table 2) (Xiao et al., 1999, Ye et al., 2012, Karim et al., 2014, Bodager et al., 2015, Parsons et al., 2015). C. hominis/Cryptosporidium parvum-like sequences were identified in red and black-and-white colobus monkeys in Uganda (Salyer et al., 2012). However, typing was obtained using a short fragment of the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene, which is not reliable for differentiating Cryptosporidium species. In Australia, a number of recent studies have also identified C. hominis/C. parvum-like isolates at the 18S locus in marsupials including bandicoots, brushtail possums, eastern grey kangaroos and brush-tailed rock-wallabies (Hill et al., 2008, Ng et al., 2011, Dowle et al., 2013, Vermeulen et al., 2015). However, despite efforts, the identification of C. hominis/C. parvum could not be confirmed at other loci. This might be due to low numbers of oocysts and the multi copy nature of the 18S rRNA gene. Another study reported a C. hominis-like sequence at the 18S locus in a wild dingo, but was also unable to confirm this at other loci (Ng et al., 2011).

Subtyping of C. hominis at the gp60 locus has identified nine subtype families (Ia to Ij) (Ryan et al., 2014). To date, few C. hominis subtypes have been reported in wild mammals but include subtype IbA12G3 in Rhesus macaques, subtype IiA17 in Cynomolgus monkeys and Rhesus monkeys and subtype IfA12G2 in baboons and Mitumba chimpanzees (Feng et al., 2011b, Karim et al., 2014, Bodager et al., 2015, Parsons et al., 2015).

Recently, C. hominis has been identified and enumerated from eastern grey kangaroos and cattle faecal samples from Sydney catchments and characterised at multiple loci (Zahedi et al., 2015). In that study, C. hominis isolates were typed at three loci (18S, a novel mucin-like glycoprotein that contains a C-type lectin domain and the gp60 gene) (Zahedi et al., 2015). The C. hominis IbA10G2 subtype was identified in the marsupials and cattle (Zahedi et al., 2015), which is the main subtype associated with outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis by C. hominis (Xiao, 2010).

C. parvum

C. parvum was first described in mice (Tyzzer, 1912) and is primarily a parasite of artiodactyls and humans (Xiao, 2010). C. parvum has however been frequently reported in wildlife, infecting a broad range of wild species including various rodents, bovids, camelids, equids, canids, non-human primates and marine mammals (Table 2) (Morgan et al., 1999a, Atwill et al., 2001, Perez and Le Blancq, 2001, Matsubayashi et al., 2004, Ryan et al., 2004, Appelbeea et al., 2005, Feng et al., 2007, Meireles et al., 2007, Paziewska et al., 2007, Starkey et al., 2007, Ziegler et al., 2007, Gómez-Cousoa et al., 2012, Ye et al., 2012, Abu Samraa et al., 2013, Liu et al., 2013, García-Presedo et al., 2013b, Reboredo-Fernández et al., 2014, Montecino-Latorre et al., 2015, Wells et al., 2015, Matsui et al., 2000).

Few studies have identified C. parvum in captive wild mammals but red deer, fallow deer, addaxes, Arabian oryx, gemsboks, and sable antelopes are among mammals to be infected with C. parvum in captivity (Perez and Le Blancq, 2001, Ryan et al., 2003, Hajdusek et al., 2004, Abe et al., 2006, Feng et al., 2007, Meireles et al., 2007, Matsubayashi et al., 2004, Bodager et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2015a).

Subtyping of C. parvum at the gp60 locus has identified fourteen subtype families (IIa to IIo (Ryan et al., 2014)). Few studies which identified C. parvum in wild mammals have conducted typing at the gp60 locus but a variety of C. parvum subtypes including IIdA15G1, IIdA18G1, IIdA19G1 have been reported from golden takins, lemurs, chipmunks and hamsters, and IIaA15G2R1, IIaA19G2R1, IIaA19G3R1, IIaA19G4R1, IIaA20G3R1, IIaA20G4R1, IIaA20G3R2 and IIaA21G3R1 have been reported from deer and Eastern grey kangaroos (Lv et al., 2009, Bodager et al., 2015, Montecino-Latorre et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2015a; Zahedi et al., 2015). These are all C. parvum subtypes that have been reported in humans (Xiao, 2010).

Cryptosporidium cuniculus

C. cuniculus (previously known as rabbit genotype) was first described in rabbits by Inman and Takeuchi (1979), who described the microscopic detection and ultra-structure of endogenous Cryptosporidium parasites in the ileum of an asymptomatic female rabbit. Molecular characterisation of C. cuniculus was first conducted on rabbit faecal samples from the Czech Republic (Ryan et al., 2003) and C. cuniculus was formally re-described as a species in 2010 (Robinson et al., 2010). Since then, it has been described from rabbits across a wide geographic area including Australia, China, the UK, the Czech Republic, Poland, France and Nigeria (Ryan et al., 2003, Nolan et al., 2010, Shi et al., 2010, Chalmers et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2012, Nolan et al., 2013, Liu et al., 2014, Koehler et al., 2014, Puleston et al., 2014; Zahedi et al., 2015). C. cuniculus has a close genetic relationship with C. hominis and its zoonotic potential became clear in 2008, when it was responsible for a drinking-water associated outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in the UK (Chalmers et al., 2009, Robinson et al., 2011, Puleston et al., 2014) and has also been identified in many sporadic human cases of cryptosporidiosis (Robinson et al., 2011, Chalmers et al., 2011, Elwin et al., 2012, Koehler et al., 2014). It is also the third most commonly identified Cryptosporidium species in patients with diarrhoea in the UK (Chalmers et al., 2011). Subtyping at the gp60 locus has identified two distinct subtype families, designated Va and Vb (Chalmers et al., 2009). Most cases described in humans relate to clade Va and the first waterborne outbreak was typed as VaA22 (Robinson et al., 2008, Chalmers et al., 2009). C. cuniculus has been reported in rabbits and humans (subtypes VaA9–VaA22 and VbA20–VbA37 – see Wang et al., 2012) but has recently been identified in marsupials (subtype VbA26) (and a human – subtype VbA25) in Australia (Nolan et al., 2013, Koehler et al., 2014). The widespread occurrence of C. cuniculus genotypes in rabbits and the fact that it has been now been identified in marsupials in Australia suggests that C. cuniculus might be a species more ubiquitous than previously thought, and might be able to spread to other mammals as well as humans. Therefore, there is a need to diligently monitor for C. cuniculus in the vicinity of drinking water catchments and in drinking water.

Cryptosporidium ubiquitum

C. ubiquitum (previously cervine genotype, cervid, W4 or genotype 3) was first identified by Xiao et al. (2000) in storm water samples in lower New York State (storm water isolate W4, GenBank accession no. AF262328). Subsequently, Perez and Le Blancq (2001) identified this genotype in white-tailed deer-derived isolates from lower New York State and referred to it as genotype 3. Since then it has been described in a wide variety of hosts worldwide including humans and was formally described as a species in 2010 (Fayer et al., 2010). C. ubiquitum is of public health concern because of its wide geographic distribution and broad host range (Li et al., 2014). In addition to domestic animals (in particular sheep) and wildlife, C. ubiquitum has been frequently reported from drinking source water, storm water runoff, stream sediment and wastewater in various geographic locations, suggesting potential contamination of water sources with oocysts of C. ubiquitum shed by animals inhabiting water catchments (Nolan et al., 2013, Li et al., 2014). C. ubiquitum is considered an emerging zoonotic pathogen (Li et al., 2014), as it has been identified in many human cases of cryptosporidiosis in the United Kingdom, Slovenia, the United States, Canada, Spain, New Zealand, Venezuela and Nigeria (Chalmers et al., 2011, Wong and Ong, 2006, Fayer et al., 2010, Cieloszyk et al., 2012, Elwin et al., 2012, Blanco et al., 2015, Qi et al., 2015a).

In wildlife, C. ubiquitum has been reported sporadically in rodents, wild ruminants, carnivores, marsupials and primates (Table 2) (Perez and Le Blancq, 2001, da Silva et al., 2003, Ryan et al., 2003, Feng et al., 2007, Feng, 2010, Karanis et al., 2007, Ziegler et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2008, Fayer et al., 2010, Cinque et al., 2008, Robinson et al., 2011, Feng et al., 2011b, Abu Samraa et al., 2013, Mi et al., 2013, Murakoshi et al., 2013, Li et al., 2014, Ma et al., 2014, Perec-Matysiak et al., 2015, Qi et al., 2015a, Qi et al., 2015b, Stenger et al., 2015b, Vermeulen et al., 2015).

Because C. ubiquitum is genetically distant from C. hominis and C. parvum, until recently, gp60 homologs had not been sequenced. However, the gp60 gene of C. ubiquitum was identified by whole-genome sequencing and six subtype families (XIIa–XIIf) within C. ubiquitum were identified (Li et al., 2014). Application of this new tool to human, animal, and environmental (water) isolates has suggested that sheep and rodents are a key source of C. ubiquitum transmission to humans, through either direct human contact with infected animals or by contamination of drinking source water (Li et al., 2014). For example, in the US, all C. ubiquitum specimens from humans characterized belonged to the same subtype families found in wild rodents in the US (XIIb, XIIc and XIId) (Li et al., 2014). However, as persons in the United States usually have little direct contact with wild rodents, the authots concluded that transmission of C. ubiquitum to humans from rodents was likely to come from drinking untreated water contaminated by wildlife (Li et al., 2014).

Cryptosporidium muris

C. muris is a gastric parasite and was first identified in the gastric glands of mice in 1907 by Tyzzer (1907). Since then, molecular tools have shown that it has a wide host range, including various mammals (rodents, canids, felids, suids, giraffida, equids, non-human primates and marsupials) and birds (Table 1, Table 2). C. muris is considered a zoonotic species as there have been numerous reports of C. muris in humans and one report in human sewage (Guyot et al., 2001, Gatei et al., 2002, Tiangtip and Jongwutiwes, 2002, Gatei et al., 2003, Palmer et al., 2003, Gatei et al., 2006, Leoni et al., 2006, Muthusamy et al., 2006, Azami et al., 2007, Al Brikan et al., 2008, Neira et al., 2012, Hasajová et al., 2014, Petrincová et al., 2015, Spanakos et al., 2015, Hurkova et al., 2003).

In a recent human infectivity study, C. muris was examined in six healthy adults (Chappell et al., 2015). Volunteers were challenged with 105 C. muris oocysts and monitored for 6 weeks for infection and/or illness. All six patients became infected. Two patients experienced a self-limited diarrhoeal illness. C. muris oocysts shed during the study ranged from 6.7 × 106 to 4.1 × 108, and C. muris-infected subjects shed oocysts longer than occurred with other species studied in healthy volunteers. Three volunteers shed oocysts for 7 months (Chappell et al., 2015). The authors concluded that healthy adults are susceptible to C. muris, which can cause mild diarrhoea and result in persistent, asymptomatic infection (Chappell et al., 2015), which confirms the zoonotic status of C. muris and highlights the public health risks of finding C. muris in wildlife in drinking water catchments.

Cryptosporidium andersoni

Like C. muris, C. andersoni is also a gastric parasite and primarily infects the abomasum of cattle and to a lesser extent, sheep and goats (Ryan et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2012). C. andersoni produces oocysts that are morphologically similar to, but slightly smaller than those of C. muris (7.4–8.8 × 5.8–6.6 μm vs 8.2–9.4 × 6.0–6.8 μm, respectively) and was originally mistakenly identified in cattle as C. muris based on its oocyst size. In 2000, it was described as a new species based on the location of endogenous stages in the abomasum, its host range, and genetic distinctness at multiple loci (Lindsay et al., 2000). It has only occasionally being detected in wild animals (Table 2) (Ryan et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2015, Lv et al., 2009, Feng, 2010, Zhao et al., 2015a). Several studies have reported that C. andersoni is the dominant species in source and tap water (Feng et al., 2011a, Nichols et al., 2010), suggesting that cattle may be the primary source of contamination. Interestingly, in a recent study, it was found at a prevalence of 15.6% (19/122) and 0.5% (1/200) in captive and wild giant pandas, respectively in China (Wang et al., 2015). It is occasionally detected in humans (Leoni et al., 2006, Morse et al., 2007, Waldron et al., 2011, Agholi et al., 2013, Jiang et al., 2014, Liu et al., 2014). Two studies in China by the same research group have reported that C. andersoni was the most prevalent Cryptosporidium species detected in humans (Jiang et al., 2014, Liu et al., 2014). However, further research is required to better understand the zoonotic importance of C. andersoni.

Cryptosporidium canis

C. canis (previously dog genotype 1) was first identified as the dog genotype by Xiao et al. (1999) and described as a species in 2001 (Fayer et al., 2001), on the basis that C. canis oocysts were infectious for calves but not mice and were genetically distinct from all other species. C. canis and its sub-genotypes (C. canis fox genotype and C. canis coyote genotype) have been reported in dogs, foxes and coyotes (Table 2) (Xiao et al., 2002a, Zhou et al., 2004, Fayer et al., 2010, Feng, 2010). C. canis has also been reported worldwide in humans (Lucio-Forster et al., 2010, Fayer et al., 2010, Elwin et al., 2012, Mahmoudi et al., 2015, Parsons et al., 2015).

Cryptosporidium erinacei

Little is known about epidemiology and pathogenicity of zoonotic C. erinacei in wildlife. C. erinacei (previously known as hedgehog genotype) was first identified morphologically in a captive four-toed hedgehog (Ateletrix albiventris) in 1998 (Graczyk et al., 1998). An isolate from a European hedgehog originating from Denmark was typed in 2002 (Enemark et al., 2002) and shown to be distinct. Subsequent studies have identified C. erinacei in hedgehogs, horses and humans (Dyachenko et al., 2010, Laatamna et al., 2013, Kváč et al., 2014a, Kváč et al., 2014b, Meredith and Milne, 2009). At the gp60 locus, C. erinacei isolates are identified as subtype family XIII (Dyachenko et al., 2010, Laatamna et al., 2013, Lv et al., 2009, Kváč et al., 2014b). Previously reported C. erinacei subtypes include XIIIaA20R10 (KF055453), XIIIaA21R10 (GQ214085), XIIIaA22R9 (KC305644), XIIIaA19R12 (GQ214081), and XIIIaA22R11 (GQ259140) Kváč et al., 2014b).

Cryptosporidium fayeri and Cryptosporidium macropodum

The two main species identified in a wide range of marsupials are C. fayeri and C. macropodum (previously marsupial genotype I and II) (Table 2) (Morgan et al., 1997, Power et al., 2004, Power et al., 2005, Power and Ryan, 2008, Ryan et al., 2008, Nolan et al., 2010, Power, 2010, Ng et al., 2011, Yang et al., 2011, Ryan and Power, 2012, Nolan et al., 2013, Vermeulen et al., 2015; Zahedi et al., 2015). Neither of these species is associated with diarrhoea in their marsupial hosts (Ryan and Power, 2012). C. macropodum has not been reported in humans but cryptosporidiosis caused by C. fayeri has been reported in a 29-year-old female patient in Australia (Waldron et al., 2010). The woman was immuno-competent but suffered prolonged gastrointestinal illness. The patient resided in a national forest on the east coast of New South Wales, Australia, an area where marsupials are abundant. She had frequent contact with partially domesticated marsupials (Waldron et al., 2010). Identification of C. fayeri in a human patient is a concern for water catchment authorities in the Sydney region. The main water supply for Sydney, Warragamba Dam, covers 9050 km2 and is surrounded by national forest inhabited by diverse and abundant marsupials. At the gp60 locus, the subtype family IV has been identified with 6 subtypes (IVa–IVf) (Power et al., 2009). Subtyping of the human-derived isolate of C. fayeri identified IVaA9G4T1R1, which has also been identified in eastern grey kangaroos in Warragamba Dam, suggesting possible zoonotic transmission (Power, 2010, Waldron et al., 2010).

In addition to C. fayeri and C. macropodum, there have been several other host-adapted genotypes identified in Australian marsupials. Possum genotype I has been described in brushtail possums, a host species found in a range of habitats throughout Australia (Hill et al., 2008) and the novel kangaroo genotype I in western grey kangaroos (Yang et al., 2011). Possum genotype I and kangaroo genotype I have not been reported in humans or other animals and their zoonotic potential is unknown.

Cryptosporidium meleagridis

Table 3 Cryptosporidium species and genotypes in avian hosts confirmed by molecular analysis (Modified from Ryan and Xiao, 2014).. Although primarily a bird parasite (see section 3.2.1 and Table 3), C. meleagridis has been identified in deermice, mountain gorillas and marsupials (Feng et al., 2007, Sak et al., 2014, Vermeulen et al., 2015). It is also the third most prevalent species infecting humans (Morgan et al., 2000, Cama et al., 2003, Gatei et al., 2006, Muthusamy et al., 2006, Leoni et al., 2006, Berrilli et al., 2012, Elwin et al., 2012, Neira et al., 2012, Silverlås et al., 2012, Kurniawan et al., 2013, Sharma et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014, Adamu et al., 2014, Ghaffari and Kalantari, 2014, Ryan and Xiao, 2014, Ghaffari and Kalantari, 2014, Rahmouni et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2014, Stensvold et al., 2014, Stensvold et al., 2015). In some studies, C. meleagridis prevalence is similar to that of C. parvum (Gatei et al., 2002, Cama et al., 2007). The ability of C. meleagridis to infect humans and other mammals, and its close relationship to C. parvum and C. hominis at multiple loci, has led to the suggestion that mammals actually were the original hosts, and that the species has later adapted to birds (Xiao et al., 2002a,). Subtyping at the gp60 locus has identified seven subtype families (IIIa to IIIg) (Stensvold et al., 2015). More details on transmission dynamics will be discussed in section 3.2.1.

Other Cryptosporidium species and genotypes reported in wild mammals

A number of other Cryptosporidium species and genotypes have been identified in wildlife (Table 2). Most are host-adapted genotypes that are not of public health significance, however several have been identified in humans (Table 2). Of these, the chipmunk genotype I is considered an emerging human pathogen (Jiang et al., 2005, Feltus et al., 2006, Feng et al., 2007, ANOFEL Cryptosporidium National Network, 2010, Insulander et al., 2013, Lebbad et al., 2013, Guo et al., 2015). At the gp60 locus, 15 different subtypes have been identified but subtypes differ only in the number of tandem repeats (TCA/TCG/TCT) and comprise a single subtype family (XIVa). Analysis indicates that subtypes from humans and wildlife are genetically similar and zoonotic transmission might play a potential role in human infections (Guo et al., 2015). The skunk and mink genotypes have also been reported in a few human cases of cryptosporidiosis (Robinson et al., 2008, Chalmers et al., 2009, Rengifo-Herrera et al., 2011, Elwin et al., 2012, Ng-Hublin et al., 2013, Ebner et al., 2015).

Cryptosporidium in birds

The mobility of migratory birds, together with their distribution and ability to form large colonies, makes them potentially suitable to spread pathogens. Due to their easy access to drinking water catchments and other water sources, wild birds are believed to be a potential risk to drinking water safety. The epidemiology of avian cryptosporidiosis, in particular zoonotic Cryptosporidium species infecting birds is therefore of public health importance. Currently only three avian Cryptosporidium spp. are recognised; C. meleagridis, C. baileyi and C. galli (Table 3) (Ryan and Xiao, 2014).

C. meleagridis

C. meleagridis infects the intestinal (small and large intestine and bursa) epithelial cells of a wide range of birds (Table 3) (Ryan and Xiao, 2014). It was first detected in a wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) by Tyzzer in 1929, but named as a valid Cryptosporidium species in 1955 (Slavin, 1955). C. meleagridis oocysts have been experimentally infected into broiler chickens, ducks, turkeys, calves, pigs, rabbits, rats and mice (Darabus and Olariu, 2003, Ryan and Xiao, 2014). It has also been reported as one of the most commonly detected human-infectious Cryptosporidium species in wastewater (Feng et al., 2007, Feng et al., 2011a, Li et al., 2012).

Molecular analysis has revealed that C. meleagridis has relatively low host specificity, and many C. meleagridis subtypes at other loci have been found in both birds and humans and both anthroponotic and zoonotic transmission routes have been suggested (Cama et al., 2003, Elwin et al., 2012, Silverlås et al., 2012). Subtyping at the gp60 locus has identified seven subtype families (IIIa–IIIg) and the likely occurrence of cross-species transmission of C. meleagridis between birds and humans (Wang et al., 2014). Human volunteer studies have shown that healthy adults can be infected and become ill from ingestion of C. meleagridis oocysts (Chappell et al., 2011). In the study by Chappell et al., five volunteers were challenged with 105 C. meleagridis oocysts and monitored for six weeks for faecal oocysts and clinical manifestations. Four volunteers had diarrhoea; three had detectable faecal oocysts; and one infected volunteer remained asymptomatic. All infections were self-limited and oocysts were cleared within ≤12 days of challenge (Chappell et al., 2011).

Cryptosporidium baileyi

C. baileyi is generally associated with the respiratory form of cryptosporidiosis in birds and has been predominantly reported in broiler chickens. Compared to C. meleagridis, C. baileyi is capable of infecting a larger spectrum of avian hosts (Table 3), targeting various sites of infection mostly associated with digestive and respiratory tracts (Ryan and Xiao, 2014). Experimental cross-transmission of C. baileyi to other birds has been successfull, however there has been no reports of cross-transmission between birds and other vertebrates (Lindsay and Blagburn, 1990, Cardozo et al., 2005), except for a single unsubstantiated report of human infection with C. baileyi which did not include any molecular analysis (Ditrich et al., 1991). Therefore, C. baileyi is not considered to be of public health significance.

Cryptosporidium galli

Unlike other avian species, C. galli is a gastric species with endogenous developmental stages occurring in the glandular epithelial cells of the proventriculus (Pavlásek, 1999, Pavlásek, 2001, Ryan et al., 2003, Ng et al., 2006, Ryan and Xiao, 2014). It predominantly infects birds of the family Spermestidae, Fringilidiae and domestic chickens (Gallus gallus), and seems to be more prevalent among songbirds (Table 3). Successful experimental cross-transmission of C. galli to other chickens have been reported, however the full extent of its host range is still unknown (Ryan, 2010). It has not been reported in humans.

Other Cryptosporidium species and genotypes reported in birds

In addition to C. meleagridis, other zoonotic species of Cryptosporidium reported in birds include C. hominis, C. parvum, C muris and C. andersoni (Zylan et al., 2008, Jellison et al., 2009, Ryan, 2010, Reboredo-Fernández et al., 2015, Gomes et al., 2012). In addition, twelve genotypes; avian genotypes I–V, the black duck genotype, the Eurasian woodcock genotype and goose genotypes I–V have been reported (Table 3). To date, there is no evidence of human cryptosporidiosis caused by these genotypes.

Cryptosporidium in fish and marine mammals

Table 4 Cryptosporidium sp. reported in fish using molecular tools (modified from Ryan et al., 2014).. Cryptosporidium has been described in both fresh and marine water piscine species with parasitic stages located either on the stomach or intestinal surface, or deep within the epithelium (Table 4). The first account of Cryptosporidium in a piscine host was Cryptosporidium nasorum, identified in a Naso tang, a tropical fish species (Hoover et al., 1981). However, currently only three species are recognized; C. molnari, C. scophthalmi and C. huwi (previously known as piscine genotype I) (Alvarez-Pellitero and Sitjà-Bobadilla, 2002, Alvarez-Pellitero et al., 2004, Palenzuela et al., 2010, Costa et al., 2015, Ryan et al., 2015), none of which have been reported in humans. In fish hosts, Cryptosporidium fish species and genotypes are typically located either in the stomach or intestine and the parasite can cause clinical manifestations, such as emaciation, decrease in growth rate, anorexia, whitish faeces, abdominal swelling, and ascites (Alvarez-Pellitero et al., 2004, Ryan et al., 2015). Most studies on Cryptosporidium in fish have been reported in farmed or aquarium fish (Table 4) and little data are currently available regarding the molecular identification of Cryptosporidium species and genotypes in wild fish populations and, in particular, in edible fish (Palenzuela et al., 2010, Reid et al., 2010, Barugahare et al., 2011, Gibson-Kueh et al., 2011, Koinari et al., 2013, Certad et al., 2015).

In addition to the three recognized species of Cryptosporidium in piscine hosts, numerous Cryptosporidium species and genotypes have been reported in fish including; piscine genotypes 2 to 8, un-named novel genotypes (n = 5), rat genotype III, C. parvum, C. hominis, C. xiaoi and C. scrofarum (Table 4). Of these, only C. parvum, C. hominis and C. scrofarum are of public health interest. Cryptosporidium scrofarum was identified in a whiting (Reid et al., 2010); C. parvum was found in School whiting, Nile tilapias, a Silver barb, Arctic char and European whitefish and C. hominis was reported in Mackerel scad (Reid et al., 2010, Gibson-Kueh et al., 2011, Koinari et al., 2013, Certad et al., 2015). In one of the most recent studies, C. parvum was identified in freshwater fish from Lake Geneva (Lac Léman) by both histology and molecular analysis (Certad et al., 2015). In that study, the overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium was 36.6% (15/41); the prevalence of C. parvum and C. molnari was 86.7% (13/15) and 6.7% (1/15), respectively, while 6.7% (1/15) were mixed C. parvum and C. molnari infections (Certad et al., 2015). Histological analysis identified C. parvum developmental stages in the stomach and intestine suggesting that C. parvum was infecting the fish, rather than being passively carried which has important public health implications.

Subtyping of Cryptosporidium isolates in fish has identified C. parvum subtype IIaA18G3R1 in School whiting from Australia (Reid et al., 2010), three C. parvum subtypes (IIaA14G2R1, IIaA15G2R1 and IIaA19G4R1) in Nile tilapia, silver barb and mackerel scad and a C. hominis subtype (IdA15G1) in mackerel scad in Papua New Guinea (Koinari et al., 2013), and C. parvum subtypes IIaA15G2R1, IIaA16G2R1 and IIaA17G2R1 in Arctic char and European whitefish from France (Certad et al., 2015). All of these C. parvum subtypes are zoonotic and commonly found in cattle and humans (Xiao, 2010). The identification of the C. hominis subtype probably reflects human sewage contamination of the water. Clearly further studies in this area are required to better understand the transmission dynamics of Cryptosporidium in fish.

Cryptosporidium in amphibians and reptiles

Table 5 Amphibian and reptile Cryptosporidium species and genotypes and their hosts confirmed by molecular analyses (modified from Ryan et al., 2014).. Little is known about Cryptosporidium species infecting amphibians. Of the three orders of amphibians; Anura, Caudata and Gymnophonia, Cryptosporidium has been only reported in Anura which includes frogs and toads and only one species, C. fragile is recognised (Table 5) (Jirků et al., 2008). In transmission experiments, C. fragile was not infective in one fish species (Poecilia reticulate), four amphibian species (Bufo bufo, Rana temporaria, Litoria caerulea and Xenopus laevis), one species of reptile (Pantherophis guttatus) and SCID mice (Jirků et al., 2008). This species has not been reported in humans.

Cryptosporidium infections are ubiquitous in reptiles and have been reported in more than 57 reptilian species (O'Donoghuea, 1995, Ryan and Xiao, 2014). Unlike in other animals in which Cryptosporidium infection is usually self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals, cryptosporidiosis in reptiles is frequently chronic and sometimes lethal in some snakes. Both intestinal and gastric cryptosporidiosis has been described in snakes and lizards. To date, two species are recognised; C. serpentis (gastric) and C. varanii (C. saurophilum) (intestinal) (Levine, 1980, Pavlásek et al., 1995, Koudela and Modry, 1998, Pavlásek and Ryan, 2008); neither of which have been reported in humans, but C. serpentis has been identified in cattle (Azami et al., 2007, Chen and Qiu, 2012). A new intestinal species, Cryptosporidium ducismarci (tortoise genotype II) has been reported in several species of tortoises, snakes and lizards (Traversa, 2010). Because only molecular data are presented, this species is regarded as a nomen nudum, pending the support of morphological and biological data.

C. parvum, C. muris and Cryptosporidium tyzzeri are also commonly reported in reptiles, particularly snakes but this is thought to be due to mechanical transmission due to predation of infected rodents and is not thought to present a substantial zoonotic risk (Morgan et al., 1999a, Xiao et al., 2004b, Pedraza-Díaz et al., 2009, Díaz et al., 2013, da Silva et al., 2014). In addition, various host-adapted genotypes have been identified including tortoise genotype I and snake genotypes I and II (cf. Ryan and Xiao, 2014), which have not been reported in humans (Table 5) (Xiao et al., 2004b, Pedraza-Díaz et al., 2009, Traversa, 2010, Seva-Ada et al., 2011, Richter et al., 2011, Rinaldi et al., 2012, da Silva et al., 2014, Abe and Matsubara, 2015). There is also a single report of avian genotype V from green iguanas (Iguana inguana) (Kik et al., 2011).

The role of urbanisation in the transmission of zoonotic Cryptosporidium species from wildlife

The risk of waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis depends on a complex interplay of factors, associated with both the environment and the biology and ecology of host and parasite. Cryptosporidium detection in an animal faecal sample does not necessarily mean active infection in the host, nor does this guarantee that the parasite prevalence and the host-population dynamics are conducive to an outbreak. For these reasons the epidemiological potential of detection of Cryptosporidium in wildlife cannot be easily and fully extrapolated. An increased epidemiological risk, however, can be identified when there is an overlap between humans and the distribution and dispersal of animal hosts. This is largely due to human encroachment into wildlife-populated areas, which, by extension, also includes conversion of natural environments to drinking water catchments. Similarly, urban environments may also represent attractive new habitats for animals harbouring zoonotic Cryptosporidium spp. Thus, it is clear that wildlife-associated Cryptosporidium is an increasing concern for cryptosporidiosis in humans.

During the last 100 years in many countries of the world, there have been dramatic changes in natural/rural landscapes due to urbanization (Mackenstedt et al., 2015). Although urbanization is one of the leading causes of species extinction (McKinney, 2006), for adaptable species, urban and periurban areas can be very attractive due to increased food and water resources (waste food, pet food, garden produce, water tanks etc) (Mackenstedt et al., 2015). In these environments, wildlife species may reach far higher population densities than in more natural or rural landscapes (Bradley and Altizer, 2007), potentially increasing the faecal–oral transmission of oocysts between wildlife and humans and contamination of drinking water catchments.

Shifting boundaries between wildlife and humans have been responsible for the emergence of species like C. ubiquitum and chipmunk genotype I in human populations. For example, squirrels host C. ubiquitum, chipmunk genotype I, the skunk genotype and other Cryptosporidium genotypes associated with human disease (Feng et al., 2007, Kváč et al., 2008, Ziegler et al., 2007, Stenger et al., 2015b), and because they frequently share habitats with humans they may be a significant reservoir of human infection. Squirrels can reach relatively high densities in suitable habitats, resulting in high rates of environmental loading of Cryptosporidium oocysts (Atwill et al., 2001). For example, California ground squirrels can reach densities as high as 92 adults hectare−1 (Owings et al., 1977, Boellstorff and Owings, 1995), which when combined with shedding of up to 2 × 105 oocysts animal−1 day−1 results in rates of environmental loading equivalent to 1 × 107 oocysts hectare−1 day−1 (Atwill et al., 2004). Further analysis of squirrel populations however has suggested that most tree squirrels host zoonotic species and genotypes while ground squirrels host species and genotypes that are tribe-specific and unlikely to cause human disease, despite overlapping ranges (Stenger et al., 2015b). This highlights the importance of extensive molecular epidemiological studies of wildlife to better understand the public health risks.

While urban-environment-induced increases in wildlife population densities are conducive to elevated rates of Cryptosporidium transmission, the host specificity of some wildlife species and genotypes may limit the potential for spillover of wildlife genotypes to sympatric populations of humans. For example, in Australia, the common brushtail possum is one of the most abundant native marsupials in urban environments, having successfully adapted to utilise anthropogenic resources (Hill et al., 2008). A higher Cryptosporidium prevalence in urban compared to woodland possum populations (11.3 versus 5.6%) has been reported, but the majority of possums sampled shed low numbers of host adapted (possum genotype) oocysts (1 to 102) (Hill et al., 2008). However, the finding a C. fayeri clinical infection in a human, which had previously been thought to be a host-adapted species (Waldron et al., 2010), highlights our lack of knowledge about the human infectious potential of many species and genotypes of Cryptosporidium infecting wildlife.

Perspectives for the water industry

Management of Cryptosporidium public health risks for the drinking water industry requires the implementation of a holistic approach including research, monitoring Cryptosporidium oocysts in animals and source water and catchment management (e.g., access protection, vegetation cover, etc). As watersheds are vulnerable to contamination with both zoonotic and non-zoonotic species from wildlife, sensitive detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in water and correct identification of oocysts to the species/genotype level are essential for source water management and risk assessment (Li et al., 2015b). The routine practice of assessing Cryptosporidium contamination of catchments and drinking water supplies using total oocyst counts based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 1622/1623, cannot differentiate Cryptosporidium species and cannot reliably access viability (infectivity). This microscopy-based method, therefore overestimates the human health risk, as wildlife in catchments frequently carry non-zoonotic genotypes and species and not all oocysts are viable.

The introduction of molecular identification techniques has therefore been an important advance for water management and quantification of the risk to drinking water supplies from Cryptosporidium-infected wildlife (Nolan et al., 2013; Zahedi et al., 2015). Identification of Cryptosporidium to the species/genotype level is especially challenging for environmental (faecal and water) samples because of the usual presence of very low numbers of oocysts and high concentrations of PCR inhibitors and non-target organisms (Li et al., 2015b). It is essential however, for the assessment of the public health importance of Cryptosporidium oocysts from wildlife. Recently, the use of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes combined with melt curve analysis has been used for rapid and sensitive differentiation of zoonotic from non-zoonotic species in water samples (Li et al., 2015b). Another study of a drinking water supply in Australia, found no C. hominis in any water sample tested, but Cryptosporidium genotypes associated with native and non-native wildlife made up 70% of all isolates typed (Swaffer et al., 2014). Similarly, Ruecker et al. (2012) reported that non-zoonotic wildlife species and genotypes of Cryptosporidium accounted for 64.3% of Cryptosporidium identified in environmental water samples in Canada and that only 7.2% of human-infectious species were detected. A low prevalence of C. hominis and C. parvum was also reported by Nolan et al. (2013) in Melbourne catchments, who detected C. hominis and C. parvum in only 0.6% of samples, despite screening >2000 animal faecal samples. However, the human-infectious potential of many wildlife-adapted Cryptosporidium is currently unknown and the UK outbreak caused by C. cuniculus should act as a caution against assuming these unusual species and genotypes are not significant (Chalmers et al., 2009, Robinson et al., 2011).

Accurate, quantitative identification of Cryptosporidium in wildlife excreta is an essential starting point for estimating catchment loads (Davies et al., 2003). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) (real-time PCR) therefore represents an invaluable tool that enables rapid, high-throughput and cost-effective detection and quantitation of Cryptosporidium oocysts and is increasingly being used to monitor oocyst shedding by animals in catchments (Yang et al., 2014a). Due to the intrinsic constraints of qPCR however, standards of known concentration are required to generate calibration curves used to estimate the concentration of pathogens in a sample (Hindson et al., 2013, Rački et al., 2014). Therefore the quantification of the target molecules in the unknown sample is only as good as that of the standards used. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) (Hindson et al., 2013) is the third-generation implementation of conventional PCR that facilitates the quantitation of nucleic acid targets without the need for calibration curves (Vogelstein and Kinzler, 1999). A recent study compared ddPCR with qPCR for the quantitative detection of Cryptosporidium DNA in animal and human faecal samples (Yang et al., 2014b) and revealed that ddPCR appeared to be less sensitive to inhibitors than qPCR and that inaccurate calibration of qPCR standards resulted in qPCR overestimating the numbers of oocysts present (Yang et al., 2014b). This has important implications for catchment risk management. However, qPCR is cheaper and provides better throughput and therefore using ddPCR to precisely quantify qPCR standards would be one way to combine the advantages of the two technologies and provide more accurate assessment of Cryptosporidium catchments loads from wildlife faecal samples.

Besides quantitative considerations, measuring the infectivity is also important for adjusting the risk profile of oocysts from wildlife in source waters (Swaffer et al., 2014). For example, a recent study has shown that the infectivity fraction of oocysts within source water samples in South Australian catchments was low (∼3.1%), which provided a much more accurate water quality risk assessment (Swaffer et al., 2014). This low infectivity fraction is consistent with source water infectivity reported by Di Giovanni et al. (1999) of 4.9% and Lalancette et al. (2012) of 0%. The ability to routinely measure oocyst infectivity has been hampered by a number of issues including the distribution and low numbers of oocysts, costs and reproducibility (Di Giovanni and LeChevallier, 2005, Swaffer et al., 2014). However, recent improvements in cell culture immunofluorescence assays have led to the development of a single format assay that provides information on method performance (recovery rate), oocyst number, oocyst infectivity and genotype of infectious oocysts, overcoming these obstacles (King et al., 2015). This assay should therefore enable a more comprehensive understanding of Cryptosporidium risk for different water sources, assisting in the selection of appropriate risk mitigation measures (King et al., 2015). It is however important to remember that the detection of non-viable oocysts in the 10–20 L of the water column that is usually sampled, does not mean that other oocysts in the water body are also non-viable.

Factors that affect the viability of Cryptosporidium oocyst load in faecal samples from wildlife in the catchment and water (runoffs, water column and sediments), include solar inactivation, desiccation, temperature and residence time in catchments and these dynamics should be factored into risk assessments (Hijen et al., 2006, King and Monis, 2007, Monis et al., 2014). Transport, including hydrodynamically-driven accumulation, settlemement, dispersion, dilution etc. can also affect oocyst concentrations in the water, either positively or negatively. Peak flow periods (when the maximum area of catchment is contributing to stream flow), are a major driver behind the transport of oocysts to surface water. Therefore monitoring the distribution of Cryptosporidium during elevated flow conditions caused by rainfall run-off is important given the demonstrated positive and significant correlation between Cryptosporidium concentration with flow and turbidity (Swaffer et al., 2014). Measuring the infectivity of different wildlife-derived Cryptosporidium species under different climactic conditions is therefore crucial for accurate risk assessment of public health implications, particularly as more extreme precipitation is predicted globally (IPCC, 2013 – www.ipcc.ch) (Ryan et al., 2014).

There are still many research gaps in our understanding of the public health significance of wildlife in drinking water catchments and taxonomic and molecular epidemiological studies on Cryptosporidium spp. in wildlife, especially those in watersheds are still scarce. Whole genome studies in Cryptosporidium species will assist with the development of gp60 and other typing tools to better access the zoonotic potential and transmission dynamics of Cryptosporidium in wildlife. Morphological and biological data including pathogenicity and oocyst shedding rates are not yet available for some common zoonotic Cryptosporidium species and genotypes in wildlife. There is also a need to confirm if molecular detection of zoonotic Cryptosporidium species in wildlife is commonly associated with actual infections or mechanical transmission (Ryan et al., 2014). C. cuniculus is the only species besides C. hominis and C. parvum, known to be associated with a waterborne outbreak of human cryptosporidiosis, yet little is known about the prevalence and oocyst shedding rates of C. cuniculus in rabbits.

The evolution of methods to enumerate and genotype oocysts and determine oocyst infectivity provides much-needed tools to refine the human health risk from wildlife in catchments and future studies will provide water quality managers with much more accurate and informed data for modelling and quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA) of wildlife in various catchments.
