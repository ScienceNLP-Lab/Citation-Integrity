Identification of a Potent Inhibitor of CREB-Mediated Gene Transcription with Efficacious in Vivo Anticancer Activity

Abstract

 

Recent studies have shown that nuclear transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) is overexpressed in many different types of cancers. Therefore, CREB has been pursued as a novel cancer therapeutic target. Naphthol AS-E and its closely related derivatives have been shown to inhibit CREB-mediated gene transcription and cancer cell growth. Previously, we identified naphthamide   as a different chemotype to inhibit CREB’s transcription activity. In a continuing effort to discover more potent CREB inhibitors, a series of structural congeners of   was designed and synthesized. Biological evaluations of these compounds uncovered compound   ( ) as a potent and selective inhibitor of CREB-mediated gene transcription (IC  = 0.081 ± 0.04 μM).   also potently inhibited cancer cell growth without harming normal cells. In an in vivo MDA-MB-468 xenograft model,   completely suppressed the tumor growth without overt toxicity. These results further support the potential of CREB as a valuable cancer drug target.

Introduction

The cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) is a nuclear transcription factor that can be activated to initiate gene transcription in response to hormones, growth factors, and neuronal activity.1,2 These stimuli activate intracellular protein serine/threonine kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK).3 All these kinases have been shown to be able to phosphorylate Ser133 in CREB.1,3 Phosphorylation at Ser133 is crucial in CREB’s binding with histone acetyl transferase and mammalian transcription coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its paralog p300 to initiate CREB-dependent gene transcription. The binding interaction between CREB and CBP/p300 is mediated by the activation domain in CREB called kinase-inducible domain (KID) and KID-interacting (KIX) domain in CBP/p300.4 Three protein phosphatases, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1),5 protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A),6 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN),7 have been shown to dephosphorylate Ser133 in phosphorylated CREB to turn off CREB-dependent gene transcription.

The protein kinases leading to CREB activation are frequently overactivated, while the three phosphatases to dephosphorylate CREB are often inactivated in various cancer cells. Therefore, it was predicted that CREB would be overactivated in cancer cells. Consistent with this prediction, CREB and phosphorylated CREB have been consistently shown to be overexpressed in cancer tissues from brain,8,9 breast,10,11 lung,12 prostate,13 and bone marrow.14 Because of its aberrant activation in cancer cells, CREB has been pursued as a novel cancer therapeutic target.3 We recently identified naphthol AS-E ( , Figure 1) as a cell-permeable inhibitor of CREB-mediated gene transcription through inhibiting KID-KIX interaction,15 the essential protein–protein interaction to activate CREB-dependent gene transcription.4 Consistent with the important roles of CREB in the maintenance of cancer cells, we found that   and its close related derivatives selectively inhibited proliferation of a large panel of cancer cell lines from different organs in the low micromolar concentration range without harming normal cells in vitro.16

During our course of studies to improve the aqueous solubility and biological activity of  , we designed and synthesized compound   (Figure 1). Compound   presented significantly improved antiproliferative activity against a panel of different cancer cells.17 Unexpectedly, we found that   was rapidly converted into   under physiological conditions and was considered as a prodrug of  , where a long-range O,N-acyl transfer reaction was involved (Figure 1).17 While   displayed in vivo antibreast cancer activity, its CREB inhibition potency remained modest.17 In this report, we detail our optimization of   and identification of   ( ) as a potent CREB inhibitor with highly efficacious in vivo antibreast cancer activity.

Results and Discussion

Analog Design Rationale

A series of structural congeners of   shown in Figure 2 was designed to improve its biological activities and physicochemical properties. Compound   contains a phenolic hydroxyl group that is a potential site for glucuronidation, which would limit its metabolic stability and bioavailability.18−20 To test if this potential metabolic liability can be removed without compromising bioactivity, compound   was designed to interrogate the role of the phenol group in   in contributing to its bioactivity. Compound   also has relatively high polar surface area (PSA, 123.2 Å2) and high cLogP (5.30) (Table 1). To improve these two physicochemical parameters, compounds  ,  were designed by removing one of the conjugated planar naphthyl rings. Truncating one of the naphthyl ring systems into a benzene system decreases the PSA to ∼98 Å2 and cLogP to ∼4.9 (Table 1). Compounds  –  were designed to probe the role of the primary amino group in  . If this primary amino group tolerates structural changes, additional functional groups may be attached to the primary amino group. Analogs  –  were designed by varying the lengths of the linker and side chain to understand their roles in biological activities. As presented in Table 1, compounds  –  show decreased PSA and  –  also present decreased cLogP compared to  .

Chemistry

The synthesis of compounds  –  is presented in Schemes 1–7 and is overall similar to the synthesis of   as described before.17 All the final products were prepared in good to excellent yields. This synthesis of   is shown in Scheme 1. Mitsunobu coupling (Ph P/DEAD)21 between   and Boc-protected 3-amino-1-propanol ( ) gave  , whose Boc protecting group was removed under acidic condition to generate free base   after neutralization with NaHCO . Amide formation between amine   and previously reported acid  (17) under the BOP/DIPEA coupling condition yielded amide  . Deprotection of Boc in   with 2 N HCl delivered product  . Compound   was prepared in a similar fashion with the exception of a need for   as the key intermediate (Scheme 2). The commercially available starting materials methyl salicylate ( ) and   were coupled together under Mitsunobu reaction condition. Saponification of methyl ester   generated acid  , which was then coupled with aniline   to yield   with MsCl as the activating reagent.22 The activating reagent MsCl was found to be superior to BOP in achieving high selectivity for forming desired amide versus the alternative undesired ester.17 Removal of the Boc group from   provided amine  , which was further coupled with acid   followed by acidic deprotection of Boc to give desired product  . The activating reagent MsCl was again found to be superior to BOP in achieving high selectivity for forming desired amide versus the alternative ester and was selected for all the subsequent amide formation reactions. Compound   was prepared in two steps by coupling between amine  (17) and acid   followed by Boc deprotection (Scheme 3).

The preparation of morpholine substituted compound   is shown in Scheme 4. The morpholine side chain was incorporated into  (23) by Mitsunobu reaction with  . Saponification of ester   provided acid  , which was then coupled with amine   by MsCl/Et N to afford amide  . Treatment of   with HCl yielded corresponding hydrochloride salt  . A similar sequence of reactions was employed to prepare   and  . The side chain in   was installed by O-alkylation of naphthol  , while the N-methyl group in   was introduced by methylation of carbamate   by NaH/MeI.24

Compounds  –  having different linker and side chain lengths were synthesized as shown in Schemes 5–7. Intermediate   was prepared essentially the same as that for  (17) with the use of   as the Mitsunobu coupling partner followed by saponification, amide formation, and Boc deprotection. Amide coupling between the amine   and acid   generated amide  , whose Boc was removed under acidic condition to provide  . Intermidiates   and   were prepared by assembling building blocks   and  ,   and  , respectively (Schemes 6 and 7). Final deprotection of Boc in   and   delivered desired compounds   and   uneventfully.

Inhibition of CREB-Mediated Gene Transcription by 3b–j

The newly synthesized final compounds  –  were evaluated for their activity in inhibiting CREB-mediated gene transcription in HEK 293T cells using a CREB Renilla luciferase (RLuc) reporter assay.15 In this assay, HEK 293T cells were transfected with a RLuc reporter under the control of a synthetic CREB promoter containing three copies of cAMP-response elements (CRE). The transfected cells were then treated with different concentrations of compounds for 30 min before the induction of RLuc synthesis by forskolin (10 μM), an activator of adenylate cyclase to activate CREB’s transcription activity.25 The results from this CREB reporter assay are summarized in Table 1, where the concentrations required to inhibit 50% of CREB’s transcription activity (IC ) are shown. For comparison purpose, the potency of previously reported compound   (IC  = 2.22 μM) was also included in Table 1.17

In comparison to  , compound   without the phenol group showed about 2-fold decrease of activity in CREB inhibition (IC  = 4.69 μM), indicating that the phenol group in   has a beneficial effect on CREB inhibition. Therefore, the rest of the compounds were designed to retain this crucial phenol group. Compounds   and  , with one of the naphthyl rings being trimmed down to a benzene ring, displayed approximately 2- to 5-fold less potent CREB inhibition activity than  , suggesting that the two naphthyl rings could not be simplified to phenyl rings without compromising CREB inhibitory activity. Replacement of the primary amino group in   with morpholine ( ), N-methylamino ( ), or hydroxyl ( ) group resulted in a total loss of CREB inhibition activity for   (IC  > 50 μM) and significant decrease in CREB inhibition activity for   (IC  = 18.53 μM) and   (IC  = 7.30 μM). These data indicated that the primary amino group at the side chain of   is critical for maintaining CREB inhibition activity and not suitable for even minor modifications like methylation.

We then focused on the modification of the lengths of the linker between the two naphthyl rings and the side chain in compound   to interrogate their roles in CREB inhibition activity. Specifically, compounds  –  with two- or three-carbon chains were designed and synthesized. Gratifyingly, compound   with a two-carbon linker and a two-carbon side chain showed significantly increased CREB inhibition activity (IC  = 0.30 μM) compared to  . Furthermore, compound   with a two-carbon linker and a three-carbon side chain exhibited even more potent CREB inhibition activity (IC  = 81 nM), which is approximately 28-fold improvement over  . The enhancement of CREB inhibition activity seen for   is very structure-specific because its structural isomer  , which has a three-carbon linker and two-carbon side chain, was a much weaker CREB inhibitor with an IC  of 5.23 μM. The CREB inhibitory potency difference among   and  –  demonstrated that the length of the linker between the two naphthyl rings can dramatically affect the activity and the length of the side chain also has a critical role on the CREB inhibition activity.

Inhibition of Cancer Cell Proliferation by 3b–j

We also evaluated the antiproliferative activity of compounds  –  in four different cancer cell lines: A549 (non-small-cell lung cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer), and MDA-MB-468 (breast cancer) using the colorimetric MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay.16,26 The concentrations required to inhibit 50% of the cancer cell growth (GI ) are presented in Table 2. As reported before,17 compound   was a submicromolar inhibitor of proliferation of all the four cancer cell lines tested. The analogs  –  all presented less potent antiproliferative activity than  , in agreement with their reduced CREB inhibition potency. Although   was inactive in the CREB reporter assay, it showed weak growth inhibition activity in MDA-MB-468 cells (GI  = 13.74 μM) but no activity in the other three cancer cell lines. It is unlikely that the weak activity in MDA-MB-468 cells was a result of inhibition of CREB’s transcription activity. Similar discrepancy was also observed for  , which exhibited weak CREB inhibition activity while displaying robust antiproliferative activity in these four cancer cell lines. The GI  for   is 0.26, 1.65, 0.26, and 0.20 μM in A549, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively. Compound   displayed modest CREB inhibition activity, but it was a rather weak inhibitor of proliferation in all four cancer cell lines tested with GI  values ranging from 10.19 to 82.67 μM. Finally, in the series of compounds  –  with different lengths of the linker and side chain, we observed that potent CREB inhibitor   also potently inhibited cancer cell growth. In MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, the GI  for   was 73 and 46 nM, respectively. In A549 and MCF-7 cells, it exhibited robust activity as well with GI  of 0.47 and 0.31 μM. Compared to  ,   retained reasonable CREB inhibition activity and inhibition of cancer cell growth while   was much less potent. Therefore, compound   represents the most potent CREB inhibitor bearing potent anticancer activity reported to date.15−17,27,28

Previously, it was shown that   only weakly inhibited CREB-CBP interaction (IC  = 19.72 ± 1.78 μM) as assayed by a split RLuc complementation assay.17 We also investigated if the more potent CREB inhibitor   could inhibit CREB-CBP interaction using the same assay. It was also found to be a rather weak inhibitor of CREB-CBP interaction with IC  = 18.27 ± 2.81 μM. We conclude that   inhibits CREB’s transcription activity in living cells independent of direct CREB or CBP binding interaction. Further studies are needed to understand if   will modulate the upstream components of CREB activation.3 Or alternatively, an unbiased chemoproteomics approach29 may be utilized to identify the direct target of   to understand its mechanism of inhibiting CREB-mediated gene transcription.

The results presented above showed that the bioactivities of   are very sensitive to structural modifications to either increase or decrease its activity. The physicochemical property parameters like PSA30 and cLogP31 that are associated with cell membrane permeability do not seem to be the major determinants. For example, compounds  –  bear similar PSA, but their bioactivities do not correlate with their cLogP (Table 1). To identify the structural basis for the observed bioactivity differences among   and  – , we performed conformational searches to identify their global conformational minima using MacroModel. The conformational ensemble was generated by systematically rotating all the rotatable bonds in   and  – . The identified global conformational minima are shown in Figure 3. All the four compounds form an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the protonated ammonium nitrogen and amide carbonyl oxygen. However, the more potent CREB inhibitors   and   adopt a more compact conformation by forming π–π stacking interaction between one of the naphthyl rings and chlorophenyl ring (Figure 3). On the other hand, the same naphthyl ring in the less potent compounds   and   do not form π–π stacking interaction with the chlorophenyl ring by assuming a more extended conformation at their global minima. These differences suggest that the unique conformation associated with   and   may contribute to their potent CREB inhibitory activity and antiproliferative activity.

Compound 3i Selectively Inhibited CREB-Mediated Gene Transcription

In the CREB RLuc reporter assay with transfected HEK 293T cells, compound   was very potent in inhibiting CREB’s transcription activity. In order to investigate if   also inhibited endogenous CREB target gene expression, the transcript level of nuclear receptor related 1 protein (Nurr1/NR4A2), a well-defined CREB target gene in HEK 293T cells, was evaluated.17,32 The cells were treated with   followed by stimulation with forskolin (10 μM). Then the relative mRNA of Nurr1/NR4A2 was determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). As shown in Figure 4, forskolin robustly stimulated Nurr1/NR4A2 level to ∼31-fold.   dose-dependently inhibited transcription of Nurr1/NR4A2. Significant inhibition was observed even at 50 nM of  . In contrast, the weaker CREB inhibitor   only started to show significant inhibition at 1000 nM (Figure S1 in Supporting Information). These results are consistent with those from the CREB reporter assay.

To investigate  ’s selectivity on different transcription activators, we employed RLuc reporter assays to monitor individual transcription factor activity in HEK 293T cells. VP16-CREB is a fusion protein by fusing the potent activation domain VP16 to the full-length CREB. It requires CREB-CRE interaction for transcriptional activation, but it is a constitutively active transcription factor independent of phosphorylation as opposed to wild type CREB.33 As shown in Table 1 and Figure 5,   potently (IC  = 81 nM) and efficaciously inhibited CREB’s transcription activity in HEK 293T cells. On the other hand, it showed much less efficacious inhibition of VP16-CREB and p53-mediated gene transcription. And even this weak inhibition only occurred at high concentrations (>1 μM). In a separate transcription reporter assay with NF-κB, much higher concentrations of   were required to inhibit NF-κB-mediated gene transcription (IC  = 5290 nM, Figure S2), which is distinct from   and its phosphate.32 Collectively, these results indicate that   selectively inhibited CREB-mediated gene transcription.

Compound 3i Selectively Inhibited the Growth of Cancer Cells but Not Normal Cells

With a potent and specific CREB inhibitor   in hand, we tested if it was toxic to normal cells. Previous genetic studies have shown that normal cells tolerate well with reduced levels of CREB.34,35 As shown in Table 2 and Figure 6A,B,   potently inhibited growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells with GI  in the midnanomolar concentration range. On the other hand, no significant inhibition of growth was observed in two different normal cell lines, human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF), up to 1 μM concentration, which is more than 10-fold higher than its GI  in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. This selective toxicity is in strong contrast to conventional chemotherapeutics like doxorubicin, which did not show differential toxicity between cancer and normal cells under the same assay conditions.36 Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of CREB’s transcription activity is well tolerated in normal cells, which is consistent with the idea of cancer cells’ addiction to CREB.3,37,38

Compound 3i Completely Suppressed the Tumor Growth in Vivo

The selective in vitro toxicity of   against cancer cells versus normal cells prompted us to investigate its in vivo antitumor activity. Preliminary toxicity studies showed that intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 10 mg/kg of   is well tolerated in mice (Figure S3). This dose was chosen for in vivo antitumor efficacy studies in the MDA-MB-468 xenografts. The MDA-MB-468 tumor was allowed to grow to an average size of 100 mm3 in nude mice. Then the mice were randomized to receive either vehicle or   at 10 mg/kg once a day, 5 days per week for 5 weeks by ip injection. The tumor volumes and body weights were measured 2–3 times/week. The data in Figure 7A showed the tumor growth in the mice treated with   was efficaciously inhibited with complete tumor stasis. During the same period, the tumor volume in the vehicle-treated group was more than tripled (Figure 7A). The body weights of  -treated animals and vehicle-treated ones were indistinguishable from each other during the entire treatment period (Figure 7B), indicating no overt toxicity with this compound treatment. These results are consistent with in vitro studies with compound   (Figure 6C,D) where normal cells could tolerate much higher concentrations of   than cancer cells. These data further support the notion that pharmacologically targeting CREB is a promising strategy for development of novel cancer therapeutics.

Conclusion

In an important extension of previous work,17 we have prepared a series of naphthamide derivatives based on the structure of  . Overall, the observed antiproliferative activities of these naphthamides correlated well with their CREB inhibition activity. Structure–activity relationships observed for members of this series revealed that many structural elements present in   are crucial for maintaining CREB inhibition and cancer cell growth inhibition activity. The phenol in the chlorophenyl ring, the primary amino group in the side chain, and two naphthyl rings in   are all important for maintaining  ’s bioactivity. Importantly, the carbon chain length of the linker between the two naphthyl rings, and the carbon chain length of the side chain are absolutely critical for optimal activities. We identified compound  , which we named as  , as a potent and efficacious inhibitor toward CREB-mediated gene transcription.   also displayed potent and efficacious growth inhibition activity against cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.   should give us a new tool to further investigate CREB signaling.39

Cell Culture

HEK 293T, HFF and A549 cell lines were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MCF-7 cell lines were obtained from Developmental Therapeutics Program at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) with nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies) and 10% (v/v) HyClone fetal bovine serum (FBS, GE Healthcare Life Science, Logan, UT) at 37 °C with 5% CO . HMEC cells were obtained from Lonza (Walkersville, MA) and were cultured in MEGM complete media (Lonza) supplemented with 10 μg/mL penicillin and 10 μg/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies) at 37 °C under 5% CO .

Inhibition of CREB-Mediated Gene Transcription

HEK 293T cells in a 10 cm plate were transfected with pCRE-RLuc (6 μg) with Lipofectamine2000 (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Three hours after transfection, the cells were collected and replated into 96-well plates at ∼10 000 cells/well. The cells were allowed to attach to the bottom of the plates overnight. The cells were then treated with different concentrations of different compounds for 30 min, when forskolin (10 μM) was added to each well. The cells were incubated for further 5 h before cell lysis using 1× 30 μL Renilla luciferase lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). An amount of 5 μL of the lysate was combined with 30 μL of benzyl-coelenterazine (Nanolight, Pinetop, AZ) solution in PBS (pH 7.4, 10 μg/mL). The protein concentration in each well was determined by Dye Reagent Concentrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The Renilla luciferase activity was normalized to protein content in each well and expressed as relative luciferase unit/μg protein (RLU/μg protein). The IC  was derived from nonlinear regression analysis of the RLU/μg protein–concentration curve in Prism 5.0 (La Jolla, CA).

Cell Growth Inhibition Assay

The growth inhibition of different cell types was assessed by MTT assay using MTT reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Briefly, the cells were plated into 96-well plates and the cells were allowed to attach to the bottom of the plates overnight. Then the cells were treated with different concentrations of different drugs for 72 h. The media were removed, and MTT reagent in complete tissue culture media (0.5 mg/mL) was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The incubation media were removed and 100 μL of DMSO was added to each well. The absorbance of the formed purple formazan solution was read at 570 nm using Packard Fusion plate reader. The percent of growth is defined as 100 × (A  – A )/(A  – A ), where A  represents absorbance in wells treated with a compound, A  represents the absorbance at time 0, and A  denotes media-treated cells. The GI  was derived from nonlinear regression analysis of the percent of growth–concentration curve in Prism 5.0.

qRT-PCR

The qRT-PCR assay was carried out essentially in the same way as described before.17 Briefly, HEK 293T cells were treated with different compounds for 1 h followed by treatment with DMSO or forskolin (10 μM) for 45 min. Then total RNA was isolated and treated with DNase I using NucleoSpin RNA kit (Clontech). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on QuantStudio 7 Flex using SYBR Advantage qPCR Premix (Clontech). The 2–ΔΔCT method was used to analyze the relative changes in gene expression16,40 with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT) as the reference gene. The primers used were the same as before.17

In Vivo Xenograft Study

All the procedures for animal handling, care, and the treatment in this study were performed according to the guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Oregon Health & Science University following the guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). Each 6- to 8-week old BALB/c nude mouse (Charles River Laboratories) was inoculated subcutaneously at the right flank with MDA-MB-468 cells (5 × 106) in 0.1 mL of HBSS with Matrigel (1:1) for tumor development. When the tumor volume reached approximately 100 mm3, the mice were randomized to be treated with either vehicle or   at 10 mg/kg.   was dissolved in 1% N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), 5% Tween-80 in H O. The dosing solution was prepared weekly. The mice were treated once a day for 5 consecutive days a week, and the treatment lasted for 5 weeks. During the treatment, the tumor size and body weight were measured 2–3 times a week. The tumors were measured in two dimensions using a digital caliper, and the volume was expressed in mm3 using the formula V = 0.5ab2, where a and b represent the long and short diameters of the tumor, respectively. The tumor volume was normalized to the initial tumor volume at the time of the first treatment. Student t-test was used for statistical analysis.

Molecular Modeling

All the molecular modeling studies were conducted in Schrodinger Small Molecule Drug Discovery Suite (Portland, OR). All the structures were first optimized using MacroModel with MMFFs force field in the absence of any solvent. The charges were from the force field. Powell–Reeves conjugate gradient (PRCG) minimization algorithm was used, and all minimizations were converged to 0.05 kJ mol–1 Å–1. To identify the global conformational minimum for each compound, the minimized structure was subjected to a conformational search by rotating all the rotatable bonds in each structure. MMFFs force field was used. The global energy minimum was taken for cLogP and PSA calculation using QikProp module.
