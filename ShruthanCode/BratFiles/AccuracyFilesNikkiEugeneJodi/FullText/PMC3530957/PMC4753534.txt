Discovery, Optimization, and Characterization of Novel Chlorcyclizine Derivatives for the Treatment of Hepatitis C Virus Infection

Abstract

 

Recently, we reported that chlorcyclizine (CCZ,  ), an over-the-counter antihistamine piperazine drug, possesses in vitro and in vivo activity against hepatitis C virus. Here, we describe structure–activity relationship (SAR) efforts that resulted in the optimization of novel chlorcyclizine derivatives as anti-HCV agents. Several compounds exhibited EC  values below 10 nM against HCV infection, cytotoxicity selectivity indices above 2000, and showed improved in vivo pharmacokinetic properties. The optimized molecules can serve as lead preclinical candidates for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection and as probes to study hepatitis C virus pathogenesis and host–virus interaction.

Introduction

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family. The HCV replication cycle is initiated by virions entering the host cell via interaction with cell surface receptors. Following pH-dependent fusion and uncoating, the HCV RNA genome is translated. The resulting polyprotein undergoes proteolytic cleavage into structural (core, E1, and E2) and nonstructural (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) proteins. After RNA replication, HCV undergoes assembly, maturation, and secretion processes.1,2

HCV leads to acute and chronic inflammatory hepatic infections that often progress toward chronic liver diseases, including cirrhosis, with an elevated risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. There is no vaccine for HCV to date.3 Besides there being around 180 million people chronically infected worldwide with HCV, the standard of care for many years has been limited to interferon α (IFN-α) in combination with ribavirin (RBV).4,5 This combination therapy is partially effective with serious adverse effects. Drug discovery efforts during the past 20 years led to a new paradigm for HCV treatment, which is marked by the recent approval of multiple direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for interferon-free regimens.2,6,7 The DAAs inhibit certain replication steps in the HCV replication cycle by directly targeting viral proteins, such as NS3/4A proteases, NS5A or NS5B polymerase.8 Viral rebounds were often observed during monotherapy of these DAAs due to the selection of drug-resistant viral mutants. Thus, the clinical application of DAAs is mostly limited to combination regimens, which face challenges including additional side effects, complex administration, and drug–drug interactions.2 Sofosbuvir,9 a DAA that has been approved for interferon-free regimen, costs more than $80,000 during a typical 12-week course of treatment alone, raising concerns about the affordability of DAAs in order to globally impact the burden of HCV disease.10,11 Host-targeting agents (HTAs), however, inhibit host factors that are essential in the viral replication cycle. Promising host-factor targets of HTAs include entry factors, components of viral replication complex cyclophilin A, and miR122 that bind to viral RNA to facilitate replication.1 There is a higher genetic barrier to develop resistance to HTAs.12 Moreover, HTAs can also be used as chemical probes to elucidate anti-HCV mechanisms and host–virus interactions. However, few HTA candidates are in the anti-HCV drug discovery pipeline, possibly due to the nature of primary drug screen assays that were mostly based on certain viral proteins or HCV replicons. Overall, there is still need to improve the current therapeutic regimens by exploring novel anti-HCV targets and small molecules.

Recently, we reported the anti-HCV activity of chlorcyclizine (CCZ,  ), discovered through the screening of the NCGC Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC), in a cell-based anti-HCV quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platform.13−15 The hit compound chlorcylizine HCl (CCZ ( ), Figure 1) showed potent in vitro anti-HCV activity and preferable liver distribution in mouse models, as well as in vivo efficacy against HCV infection in Alb-uPA/SCID chimeric mouse model engrafted with primary human hepatocytes.14 CCZ ( ) was also reported by Chamoun-Emanuelli et al. to block HCV entry, possibly via a cholesterol-dependent pathway.16 However, the target and precise mechanism of action of CCZ ( ) in inhibiting HCV entry remains unknown. Here, we present a SAR study aiming to optimize CCZ ( ) for an anti-HCV application focusing on the following features: generation of a nonchiral lead, improvement of its anti-HCV potency, modulation of its physicochemical properties to potentially reduce CNS exposure, reduction or elimination of its antihistamine activity, and improvement of pharmacokinetic properties. The resulting lead compounds in this series, represented by nonchiral compound  , exhibited increased anti-HCV activity and selectivity (up to 19-fold and 8-fold, respectively) and improved in vivo pharmacokinetics properties. The optimized lead compounds merit further preclinical development for the treatment of hepatitis C.

Results

The synthesis of CCZ analogues is displayed in Schemes 1–3. Scheme 1A shows the synthesis of asymmetrical CCZ derivatives. Thus, following modified literature procedures, the corresponding aldehyde or ketone underwent reductive amination with commercially available chiral   or   and NaBH CN in the presence of acetic acid (compounds  – )28 or p-toluenesulfonic acid (compound  ) using an alcoholic solvent to afford the corresponding N-alkylated derivatives. Ti(OiPr)  was required to carry out the reductive amination of the cyclopentyl ( ) and cyclohexyl ( ) derivatives.17 Acylation of   with acetyl chloride afforded N-acyl derivative  . Deuterated derivatives   and   were synthesized from   and   with CD I in the presence of aqueous NaOH. Likewise, trifluorinated derivatives   and   were prepared from the common chiral starting material and trifluoroethyl triflate in the presence of K CO .

Scheme 1B displays the synthesis of racemic CCZ analogues with a solubilizing polyethylene glycol side chain. Starting from the commercially available hydroxyzine ( ), introduction of the phthalimido moiety via standard Mitsunobu conditions afforded  . Subsequent hydrazine mediated deprotection afforded primary amine  . Elongation of the solubilizing side chain was obtained by alkylating   to produce N-Boc derivative  , which was deprotected to the free amine   and subsequently acylated to afford   (Scheme 1B).

The synthesis of achiral dichlorcyclizine derivatives is displayed in Scheme 2A. Starting from dichlorobenzophenone  , NaBH  mediated reduction of the ketone, followed by chlorination with SOCl  afforded chloride  , which was used to alkylate a variety of cyclic amine derivatives following modified literature procedures to yield compounds  –  (Scheme 2A).29−31 Piperazine derivative   was further alkylated, following a modified literature procedure, to produce the diehtylene glycol-containing compound  ,32 which was further elongated to the pentaethylene glycol amine  . To probe the halogen effect on the cyclizine scaffold, compounds   and   were prepared according to Scheme 2B, via reductive amination of acetaldehyde with the corresponding piperazines   and   in the presence of NaBH CN and acetic acid in methanol.

Cyclizine scaffold modification via exchange of the central tertiary carbon with the nitrogen analogue is displayed in Scheme 3A, where methyl piperidone underwent reductive amination with the corresponding aniline   and   to afford the intermediate amines   and  , which subsequently underwent N-arylation under Buchwald conditions to afford amines   and  . The last modification studied was the introduction of rigidity into the cyclizine scaffold. As displayed in Scheme 3B, this was accomplished by starting from the commercial bromofluorenone  , which was reduced to the alcohol with NaBH  and subsequently converted to the chloride   with CaCl  and concentrated HCl. Chloride   was used to alkylate N-ethyl piperazine to afford the cyclizine rigid analogue   (Scheme 3B).

Tables 1–3 disclose the activity of synthesized compounds in our structural/chemical modification study centered around CCZ ( ). The anti-HCV activity was reported in EC  values (concentration of compound inhibiting 50% of viral levels in comparison with the DMSO control) using the HCV-Luc (HCV JFH-1 strain, genotype 2a) with insertion of the luciferase reporter gene) infection assay. The cytotoxicity was measured by CC  values (concentration of compound exhibiting 50% cytotoxicity in comparison with the DMSO control) evaluated with an ATPlite assay in Huh7.5.1 cells, the same cell line used for measuring the antiviral activity. Thus, the activities of the hit compound, racemic CCZ ( ), and its enantiomers (  and  ) were confirmed as having good selectivities (selective indices = 1132–1875, Table 1). Nor-CCZ (compound  ), a known in vivo metabolite of CCZ, showed comparable anti-HCV activity but with reduced selectivity (Table 1). It should be noted with interest nor-CCZ’s lack of antihistamine activity (Table 4).18−20

In Table 1, we addressed the effect of two types of structural modifications: (1) chiral configurations and (2) side chains off the piperazine ring. The enantiomers of compounds  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and   showed comparable EC  and CC  values, suggesting that the chiral configuration of CCZ analogues does not have a major effect on the antiviral activity and selectivity. With compounds  ,  ,  ,  , and  , we investigated the effect of the length of the aliphatic chain on anti-HCV activity. When the number of carbons was less than 4, analogues showed comparable activity in the range of low double-digit nanomolar and comparable selectivity to CCZ ( ), regardless of whether the chain was linear or branched. Chains with a carbon number of 4 led to decreased activity as shown for compounds   and  . Surprisingly, compound  , having a cyclopentyl ring exhibited improved activity (EC  = 19 nM), while compound  , having a cyclohexyl ring, showed an activity in the expected range (EC  = 177 nM), comparable to that of compounds   and  . Additionally, acetylation of the piperazine ring dramatically reduced the potency of analogue   to a double-digit micromolar value. Introduction of a bulky substituted benzyl group also reduced the anti-HCV activity (compound  , EC  = 456 nM). Deuterium, introduced in the side chain of compounds   and   with the aim of increasing their metabolic t , did not impact their anti-HCV activity and indeed led to a slightly improved t  value (2.9 h for   in comparison with 2.2 h for   in the rat microsomal stability assay). Moreover, the trifluoromethyl group in compound   led to a complete loss of activity, potentially indicating that the pK  value of the tertiary amine was important for anti-HCV activity.

The side effects of CCZ ( ) include drowsiness, dizziness, and headache, attributed to its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and its CNS penetration. For this reason, first generation antihistamine drugs were replaced by analogues like cetirizine, with reduced CNS-related side effects.21 In order to explore the possibility of reducing the CNS penetration of our molecules, we further expanded our synthetic efforts introducing oligoethylene glycol side chains. This structural modification would increase the molecular weight, solubility, total polar surface area, and number of free rotatable bonds, also potentially leading toward longer pharmacokinetic half-lives. By using ethylene glycol or polyethylene glycol as linker, we explore the effect of introducing a series of functional groups at the terminal position. Compound   having a terminal carboxylic acid, completely lost the anti-HCV activity, potentially due to the lack of cell permeability. Moderate activities in the range of triple-digit nanomolar to single-digit micromolar were observed with carboxamide-substituted compounds  ,  ,  , and   (Table 1). Compounds  ,   and  , having hydroxyl or amino groups at the chain terminal position, displayed high anti-HCV activity and moderate cytotoxicity. It was noteworthy that a 6-fold increased activity and retained selectivity were observed with compound   (EC  values below 8 nM with selective indices above 1000) (Table 1).

Table 2 shows the activity of analogues exploring different phenyl ring substituents. Thus, elimination of the para-chloro substituent reduced the activity from double-digit nanomolar (compound  , EC = 44 nM) to single-digit micromolar (compound  , EC = 1.14 μM). Introduction of an additional para-cloro substituent in the other ring slightly increased the activity (compound  , EC = 17 nM). Following a similar trend, nonchiral dichloro compounds  ,  ,  , and   also showed increased activity (1.3–8.7-fold) in comparison with that of the corresponding monochloro analogues  ,  ,  , and  . In general, the introduction of Br substituents led to comparable activity and selectivity to the corresponding Cl substituted compounds as shown in  ,  ,  , and  .

Structural modifications to the piperazine core are displayed in Table 3, where compounds  ,  ,  , and   were included for comparison. Compound  , having a one carbon extension of the piperazine ring, retained the activity but led to increased cytotoxicity. The replacement of the piperazine ring with other ring structures in compounds  ,  , and   led to a dramatic loss of activity. In contrast, compounds  ,  , and   retained the anti-HCV activity and selectivity.

Compound  , which has a rigid cyclizine scaffold, showed an EC  value that was more than 1 μM, indicating that the conformation of the rings was important for anti-HCV activity.

From our SAR studies, we selected a number of lead compounds based on their anti-HCV activity, selectivity, and structure diversity for an expanded characterization (Table 4). The cytotoxicity of these molecules was further evaluated in HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes. All compounds showed less than 1.8-fold difference in CC  values in these two cell types in comparison with Huh7.5.1 cells (used for our anti-HCV activity assay), with the exception of compound  , which was less cytotoxic in HepG2 cells than in Huh7.5.1 (approximately 3-fold higher CC ) (Table 4). The H1HR antagonistic activity of the chosen compounds were evaluated by measuring their capacity to block the β-arrestin internalization signal induced by histamine. The numeric value observed corresponds to the percentage of activation induced by histamine (250 nM) in the presence of 10 nM of compound, using CCZ ( ) and   as the positive and negative controls, respectively. Shown in Table 4, the results of CCZ ( ) and   were consistent with previously reported results.14 Lead compounds with R  = H (compounds   and  ) showed very low H1HR inhibition (approximately 10%). Meanwhile, when R  = Me, Et, or the medium oligoethylene glycol chain, the H1HR inhibitory effects were generally lower than that of CCZ ( ) (compounds   and  ), and   showed approximately 4-fold lower inhibition. Compound   having a long oligoethylene glycol chain showed more than 3-fold lower inhibitory effect toward H1HR.

Additionally, HCV replication cycle assays were carried out to study the target stage of the CCZ analogues in the HCV replication cycle. The lead compounds exhibited potent inhibition in the HCV single-cycle assay, in which single-round infectious HCV (HCVsc) can infect hepatocytes but does not assemble into new virions (Table 4).13,14 The activity suggested that the CCZ analogues inhibited early steps of the HCV replication cycle prior to assembly. The analogues were tested in the HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) assay and the HCV subgenomic replicon assay,13 which detect whether the compounds target HCVpp entry and HCV replication, respectively. The HCVpp assay applies defective retroviral particles that harbor the HCV envelope glycoproteins to assess viral entry inhibition.13,22−24 No significant inhibitory effect was observed in the HCVpp (genotype 1a and 1b) assay with the lead compounds, except for   possibly due to cytotoxicity (Table 4). To address viral specificity in the entry process, a vesicular stomatitis virus G pseudoparticle (VSV-Gpp) and a murine leukemia virus pseudoparticle (MLVpp) were tested as the control, in which no inhibitory effect was detected (Table 4). It is worth noting that the lack of HCVpp inhibition of a compound does not necessarily exclude virus entry as a mode of action. A compound could be targeting an entry step that is not otherwise captured by the HCVpp system. Multiple HCV entry inhibitors were reported without HCVpp inhibitory effect, including NPC1L1 antagonist ezetimibe and human apolipoprotein E peptides.25,26 In the genotype 2a HCV replicon cell line, all the lead compounds failed to reduce below 60% the replicon activity, as compared to the DMSO control, indicating that RNA replication was not the target of these analogues (Table 4).

Moreover, besides the in vitro physical properties of the chosen lead compounds, their in vitro metabolic properties were also evaluated using human, mouse, and rat microsomes. Compounds  ,  , and   showed preferable human microsomal stability (t  ≥ 30 min), while maintaining reasonable solubility.

In vivo pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution levels of compound   were measured in mice after a single dose of 10 mg/kg through the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route (Table S1). The half-life in the liver was 8.5 h, which was an improvement in comparison with the half-lives of (S)-CCZ [compound  ] and (S)-nor-CCZ [compound  ] (1.99 and 4.7 h, respectively) measured under the same conditions (Figure 2A and C).14 Preferential liver distribution was also observed, as shown by the liver/plasma AUC  ratio of 16 (Figure 2C). Within 24 h after a single dose of 10 mg/kg, the liver concentration of compound   (56.9–5.29 μM) was dramatically above its in vitro EC  values (0.017 μM). To detect any potential hepatotoxicity effect, the alanine transaminase (ALT) levels27 in the mouse serum were measured (Figure 2B). When treated with compound  , the ALT levels were around or below 80 U/L at most time points except when t = 2 and 4 h, which may suggest a potential transient mild liver toxicity. From these observations, we concluded that there was not a clear correlation between the ALT levels and liver concentration of the compounds. To study whether the mild elevations of ALT level were due to compounds or the vehicle, a control study was carried out dosing the vehicle only. The ALT level was elevated at multiple time points with the treatment of the vehicle only (Figure 2B). Overall, we concluded that no clear hepatotoxicity was detected with the treatment of compound   in this condition.

To evaluate the capacity of these compounds to potentially impact other viruses in the Flaviviridae family, their antiviral activity was tested against the dengue virus. Both lead compounds   and   showed EC  values in the DENV-RVPs assay that were approximately 1000-fold more than their EC  values against HCV-Luc infection (Table 4), together with CC  values consistent with the observation when cells were infected with HCV-Luc (Table S1). The selective indices were below 5 for both compounds against the dengue virus. Furthermore, the activity of   was submitted for evaluation in the NIAID antiviral screen against 13 types of viruses: hepatitis B virus, HCV replicon, herpes simplex virus-1, human cytomegalovirus, vaccinia virus, dengue virus, influenza A (H1N1) virus, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS coronavirus, poliovirus 3, Rift Valley fever virus, Tacaribe virus, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. Little or no antiviral activity was detected (selective index < 10 and/or EC  ≥ 1 μM), suggesting that the antiviral effects and mechanism of these analogues were HCV-specific.

Discussion

Besides the advancement in developing efficacious treatments for chronic HCV infection, the cost and side effects of current approved methods point to the direction of developing alternative approaches to therapeutically intervene in the disease. In this sense, in our previous study, we disclosed the in vitro and in vivo anti-HCV properties of chlorcyclizine (CCZ,  ), a first generation antihistamine compound approved for over-the-counter use.14 Its affordability and established clinical safety profile make CCZ ( ) an attractive candidate for repurposing toward chronic HCV infection ( ). Additionally, we decided to carry out structural modifications, in vitro and in vivo studies to further optimize this series with the aim of improving their anti-HCV profile. We focused the chemical modifications on four major structural motifs: chirality, side chains off the piperazine ring, substituents on the phenyl rings, and modifications on the piperazine core. As summarized in Figure 3, chirality had little effect on the antiviral activity and selectivity. Dual para-chloro substitution on the aromatic rings led to more potent nonchiral analogues. Furthermore, the introduction of an oligoethylene glycol off the piperazine ring nitrogen improved the activity without compromising the selectivity. Most of the structure modifications in the piperazine core were not tolerated, suggesting that its geometry and its pK  value were important for the anti-HCV activity of the series. Selected lead compounds were also analyzed for additional assessment of cytotoxicity in HepG2 hepatocytes and primary human hepatocytes. They showed profiles similar to those observed in Huh7.5.1 cells, suggesting that the cytotoxicity evaluation in Huh7.5.1 cells in parallel with the HCV infection assay provides a good estimation of the cytotoxicity in human hepatocytes. Overall, the lead compounds in Table 4 exhibited excellent antiviral activity and selectivity in host cells (SI = 8608–201). One of the goals of this medicinal chemistry study was to eliminate the antihistamine side effect of CCZ ( ), which was achieved with lead compounds having R  = H or long ethylene glycol chains (compounds   and  ).

In the HCV replication cycle assays, the lead compounds showed inhibitory patterns similar to those of CCZ ( ), displaying a dramatic inhibition in early stage HCV infection (in the HCVsc assay) but no inhibition on HCVpp entry or in the HCV replicon system. Although the exact mechanism of action of CCZ ( ) is still under investigation, the observations here strongly suggest that the lead compounds likely follow the same mechanism of action as CCZ ( ), only with improved activity and selectivity.

In vitro microsomal stability assays were carried out to evaluate the potential metabolic stability of the lead compounds. Among compounds  ,  , and   with t  > 30 min in human microsomes, compound   was selected for in vivo pharmacokinetic mouse studies because of its lower in vitro cytotoxicity. Compound   showed improved PK properties in comparison with that of (S)-CCZ ( ), namely, a longer half-life, while retaining a high liver/plasma ratio.

Conclusions

Besides the progress in the treatment of chronic HCV infection, among other issues, the global affordability is still an important factor to consider within the current treatment options. Repurposing the over-the-count drug CCZ ( ) may offer an affordable treatment for chronic HCV infection.14 Additionally, we presented a chemical/structural modification study, which resulted in optimized, nonchiral well-tolerated CCZ analogues with improved anti-HCV potency and pharmacokinetic properties that are able to provide good coverage in the liver at very reasonable doses. The lead compounds inhibited HCVsc infection without affecting HCVpp entry or HCV replication in the replicon assay, which is similar to the findings for CCZ ( ), suggesting an unaltered mechanism of action. The lead compounds showing overall improved properties, will be selected for in vivo anti-HCV efficacy studies and potentially for further preclinical drug development efforts with the aim of moving additional compounds of this series toward anti-HCV human clinical trials.

HCV-Luc Infection and ATPlite Assays

Huh7.5.1 cells were plated in 96-well plates at 104 cells/well and incubated overnight. The cells were infected with HCV-Luc in the presence of increasing concentrations of the compound of interest. The viral level was measured 48 h after treatment using a Renilla luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). ATP-based cell viability assay was carried out in parallel to evaluate the cytotoxicity with an ATPlite assay kit (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The concentration values that led to 50% viral inhibition and cytotoxicity (EC  and CC ) were calculated using the nonlinear regression equation in GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).

HCV Replication Cycle Assays

After 48 h of incubation, the viral level was detected by a luciferase assay. In the HCV subgenomic replicon assay, HCV replicon (GT 2a) cells were plated into 96-well plates at 104 cells/well and incubated overnight. The cells were treated with tested compounds for 48 h, and luciferase activity was measured. In HCVpp assays, Huh7.5.1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (104 cells/well) and cultured overnight. Then, the cells were infected with HCVpp GT 1a, 1b, VSV-Gpp, and MLVpp for 4 h in the presence of compound treatment. The cells were then washed and cultured for 48 h followed by a luciferase assay to detect the HCV entry.

In Vitro and In Vivo Pharmacokinetics Properties

The in vitro microsomal stability was measured by incubation of compounds with human/mouse/rat liver microsomes at 37 °C in the presence of the cofactor, NADPH. The concentrations of compounds were measured by LC-MS/MS at 0, 5, 15, 30, and 45 min half-life (t ) was calculated as described before.35

The kinetic solubility of compounds was determined in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, using μSOL Evolution from pION Inc. ( ), with a fully automated system of sample preparation, sample analysis, and data processing. The effective permeability of compounds was determined via passive diffusion using the stirring double-sink PAMPA (Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay) method from pION Inc. ( ) with a fully automated system of sample preparation, sample analysis, and data processing.

For in vivo pharmacokinetics, 27 male CD-1 mice (∼35 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Mice were housed at the centralized animal facilities at the NIH (Bethesda, MD) with a 12 h light–dark cycle. The housing temperature and relative humidity were controlled at 22 °C and 55%, respectively. The animals had free access to water and food. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the NIH. A dosing concentration of 2 mg/mL of the appropriate compound was freshly prepared in 10% PEG300 and 90% of 30% HP-β-CD in water. The pharmacokinetics was evaluated after single intraperitoneal administration at 10 mg/kg. The blood and liver samples were collected at predose, 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 24 h. Three samples (n = 3) were collected at each time point. The concentrations of the compound in the plasma and liver were determined by ultraperformance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis (UPLC-MS/MS). The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the noncompartmental method (Model 200) of the pharmacokinetic software package Phoenix WinNonlin, version 6.2 (Certara, St. Louis, MO, USA). The area under the plasma and liver concentration versus time curve (AUC) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. Where warranted, the slope of the apparent terminal phase was estimated by log linear regression using at least 3 data points, and the terminal rate constant (λ) was derived from the slope. AUC  was estimated as the sum of the AUC  (where t is the time of the last measurable concentration) and C . The apparent terminal half-life (t ) was calculated as 0.693/λ.
