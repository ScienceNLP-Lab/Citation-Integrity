Affinity for self antigen selects regulatory T cells with distinct functional properties

Abstract

How regulatory T cells (T  cell) control lymphocyte homeostasis is not fully understood. Here we identify two T  cell populations with differing degrees of self-reactivity and distinct regulatory functions. Triplehi (GITRhiPD-1hiCD25hi) T  cell are highly self-reactive and control lympho-proliferation in peripheral lymph nodes. Triplelo (GITRloPD-1loCD25lo) T  cells are less self-reactive and limit development of colitis by promoting conversion of CD4+ T  cells into induced T  cells (iT  cells). Although Foxp3-deficient (scurfy) mice lack T  cells, they contain Triplehi-like and Triplelo-like CD4+ T cells with distinct pathological properties. Scurfy TriplehiCD4+T cells infiltrate the skin whereas scurfy TripleloCD4+T cells induce colitis and wasting disease. These findings indicate that T cell receptor affinity for self-antigens drives the differentiation of Tregs into distinct subsets with non-overlapping regulatory activities.

The importance of CD4+ regulatory T cells (T  cell) in maintaining lymphocyte homeostasis is best appreciated in mice and humans lacking these cells. Foxp3-deficient (scurfy) mice1,2,3 and patients with immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked (IPEX) syndrome4 suffer from excessive lymphocyte activation, lymphocytic infiltration into peripheral organs and colitis, leading to death at an early age. In healthy individuals, T  cells control homeostatic proliferation of conventional T and B cells and prevent colitis5,6,7.

T  cells are comprised of thymic Tregs (tT  cell) and peripherally-induced T  cells (pT  cells or iT  cells), which originate from different precursor cells and develop in different locations. tT  cells develop in the thymus and their development requires TCR stimulation with agonist peptide- major histocompatibility complex (MHC)II antigens.8,9,10 In contrast, iT  cells are generated in the periphery from naive, mature CD4+ conventional T cells (T  cells) during T cell activation in the presence of the cytokine TGF-β.11 Both populations are suppressive and their functional properties have been examined. Several studies suggest that tT  cells are required to control immune homeostasis and autoimmunity.5,12,13 On the other hand, iT  cells have specialized functions depending on the type of inflammation, and have a primary role in controlling mucosal immunity and fetal tolerance.5,12,13,14 However tT  cells by themselves are not sufficient to suppress chronic inflammation and autoimmunity in the absence of iT  cells.15

T  cells have also been characterized for their expression of surface markers and localization in different tissues.16,17,18 Based on their expression of CD44 and the lymph node homing receptor, CD62L, T  cells can be broadly divided into CD44loCD62L+ central T  (cT ) and CD44hiCD62Llo/– effector T  (eT ) cells.16 cT  cells are quiescent, primarily reside in secondary lymphoid tissues, express high levels of CD25 and are interleukin-2 (IL-2)- dependent. In contrast, eT  cells, the dominant Treg population in non-lymphoid tissues, are CD25lo, highly proliferative, but prone to apoptosis. It’s been suggested that eT  cell maintenance is driven by TCR and co-stimulatory signals, but not IL-2.16

Several studies demonstrated the importance of TCR stimulation to activate cT  cells in order to generate suppressive eT  cells.8,9 Furthermore, studies have provided direct evidence that TCR expression is indispensable for T  cell survival and suppressive function.19,20 The T  cell repertoire contains self-reactive8,21,22 as well as foreign antigen reactive23 TCRs. The TCR affinity of T  cells for self antigen has not yet been fully characterized. Although it’s generally accepted that T  cells and naive CD4+ T  cells have non-overlapping TCR repertoires, a small percentage of TCRs are found within both CD4+ T cell populations.24,25 Furthermore, the TCR repertories of tT  cells and iT  cells were shown to be distinct.26,27 While the tT  cell TCR repertoire is biased toward self-recognition, TCRs expressed in iT  cells can recognize foreign antigens with high affinity.24,26 In line with these findings, it’s been shown that activated CD4+ T cells from TCRβ transgenic (TCRβ-tg) scurfy mice preferentially used TCRs found in the T  cell TCR repertoire of TCRβ-tg wild type mice.21 Despite these interesting findings, it’s still not clear how a T  cell’s antigen specificity influences its’ regulatory properties.

Here report two functionally distinct subgroups of tT  cells with distinct TCR repertoires and differing TCR affinities for self-antigens. Triplelo (GITRloPD-1loCD25lo) T  cells express TCRs whose affinities for self-antigens are close to the negative selection threshold, whereas Triplehi (GITRhiPD-1hiCD25hi) T  cells express TCRs with affinities well above this threshold. Functionally, Triplelo T  cells control colitis by facilitating conversion of CD4+ T  cells into iT  cells, whereas Triplehi T  cells maintain lymphocyte homeostasis within peripheral lymph nodes (LNs). Finally, Foxp3-deficient (scurfy) mice contain Triplehi- like and Triplelo- like CD4+ T cells with distinct pathological properties. Our results provide evidence that the degree of thymocyte self-reactivity drives the generation of distinct T  cells subtypes, which control different aspects of lymphocyte homeostasis.

Results

Distinct Treg cell subsets

Foxp3+ T  cells express a continuum of GITR and PD-1 (Fig 1a). As GITRhiPD-1hi T  cells express higher levels of CD25 compared to GITRloPD-1lo T  cells (Fig. 1a), we refer to these populations as Triplehi (GITRhiPD-1hiCD25hi) and Triplelo (GITRloPD-1loCD25lo) T  cells, respectively. To compare these T  cell populations to previously described T  cells subsets16,17,18, we examined their expression of various homing and chemokine receptors (Fig. 1b) as well as transcription factor Helios and semaphoring receptor Nrp-1(Fig. 1c). Based on their expression of these proteins, Triplehi and TripleloT  cells are distinct from each other and distinct from centralT  and effectorT  cells (Table 1;16,17,18). This analysis also shows that centralT  and effectorT  cells are contained within the Triple intermediate (Tripleint) gate (Supplementary Fig.1).

Origin of Triplehi and Triplelo Tregs

Triplehi and TripleloT  cells present in the thymus (Fig. 2a) could represent T  cells recirculating from the periphery as opposed to de novo generated tT  cells.28,29 To resolve this, we examined thymic T  cells in mice expressing Foxp3-RFP and Rag-GFP reporters (Fig. 2b). RFP+GFP+ CD4 single positive (SP) thymocytes are de novo generated thymic T  cells since they are still Rag-GFP+, while RFP+GFP– CD4SP cells in the thymus are recirculating T  cells from the periphery.29 The frequency of de novo generated (RFP+GFP+) Triplehi and TripleloT  cells in the thymus is similar to that observed among LN T  cells. The fact that both Triplehi and TripleloT  cells develop in the thymus argues against the idea that either population are iT  cells. To address the possibility that Triplehi and TripleloT  cells might be induced by foreign antigens or inflammation, we examined T  cells in germ-free (GF) and antigen-free (AF) mice. AF mice are offspring of GF mice that were weaned onto and raised on the elemental diet of glucose and amino acids.30 As these animals lack a microbiome and are not exposed to dietary antigens, they contain exclusively self-antigens. GF and AF mice contain similar frequencies of LN T  cells compared to standard SPF animals (Fig. 2c, top). Importantly, SPF, GF and AF mice contain similar frequencies of Triplehi and TripleloT  cells (Fig. 2c, bottom), which also express similar levels of Nrp-1 and Helios protein (Supplementary Fig. 2). These data rule out the idea that the Triplehi and Triplelo phenotypes are a response to inflammation. Furthermore, these results strongly suggest that Triplehi and TripleloT  cells are exclusively generated through recognition of self-antigens.

Distinct Triplehi and Triplelo Treg cell TCR repertoires

To directly compare the TCR repertoires of Triplelo and TriplehiT  cells to CD4+T  cells, all three populations expressing the V 2 family (Fig. 3a), were sorted from a Rag+, single TCRβ chain strain (Yae62, Vβ8.2, TCRα+/KO, Foxp3GFP–KI– Supplementary Fig. 3) and subjected to deep sequencing. The 500 most frequent clonotypes in each group were analyzed for their similarity (Fig. 3 b-d) and diversity (Fig. 3e,f). Morisita-Horn analysis, which measures sequence similarity shows that the CD4+T  sequences from three independent groups of mice (see Methods) are similar to each other but significantly different from Triplelo and Triplehi TCR sequences obtained from the same mice (Fig. 3b). Triplelo sequences isolated from different groups of mice are similar to each other as well, but different from CD4+T  and Triplehi TCRs (Fig. 3c). Triplehi TCR sequences are not only different from CD4+T  and Triplelo sequences, but they vary between different groups of mice (Fig. 3d). Despite their significant sequence differences, the TCR repertoires of CD4+T  cells and TripleloT  cells are similarly diverse (Fig. 3e, f), while the TriplehiT  cell TCR repertoire may be less diverse, at least according to Shannon Entropy analysis, which is used to measure sequence diversity. Taken together, deep sequencing showed that TriplehiT  cells, TripleloT  cell and CD4+T  cells have clearly distinct TCR repertoires, implying that TCR specificity is important in selecting these T  cell subtypes.

Self-reactivity of Triplehi and Triplelo Treg cells

To directly test whether Triplehi and Triplelo T  cell differ in their degree of self-reactivity, we examined CD5 and Nur77 protein expression in each subset (Fig. 4a). The expression of these markers reflects T cell activation and correlates with TCR affinity for its peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligand.31,32 The higher expression of Nur77 and CD5 by Triplehi T  cells, compared to Triplelo T  cells (Fig. 4a) argued that Triplehi T  cells are more self-reactive than their Triplelo T  cell counterparts. To test this idea, we used in vivo BrdU labeling and observed that TriplehiT  cells proliferate more frequently in vivo compared to TripleloT  cell and CD4+T  cells (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, culturing unsorted CD4+T cells on syngeneic bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs), TriplehiT  cells proliferate more extensively than TripleloT  cells and CD4+T  cells (Fig. 4c); this proliferation requires expression of MHCII self-antigens on antigen presenting cells (APCs).

To examine the influence of antigen affinity on the generation of CD4SP thymocytes with a Triplehi or Triplelo phenotype (Fig. 4d), B3K508TCR-tg Rag2–/– thymocytes, expressing the B3K508 TCR and recognizing the 3K, P2A and P-1A peptides presented by I-Ab were cultured on syngeneic BMDCs in the presence of TGF-β and IL-2. Addition of P-1A peptide (high affinity threshold negative selector) induced development of Triplelo CD4SP thymocytes, while the P2A peptide (intermediate affinity negative selector) induced intermediate (Tripleint) CD4SP thymocytes; finally, 3K-peptide (high affinity negative selector) induced only Triplehi CD4SP thymocytes (Fig. 4d, top). Foxp3+T  cells were also generated in these cultures, but only in the presence of negative selecting peptides (Fig. 4d, middle, Supplementary Fig. 4a). Culturing B3K508TCR-tg Rag2–/– thymocytes with the negative selecting ligands, P-1A, P2A and 3K generated Foxp3+T  cells expressing increasing amounts of PD-1 (Fig 4d), CD25 and Helios protein (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Taken together, the data indicate that threshold-, intermediate- and high- affinity negative selecting antigens induce Triplelo, Tripleint and Triplehi T  cells, respectively (Fig 4d, bottom; Supplementary Fig. 4b). That the threshold negative selector induces weaker TCR signals is supported by its decreased ability to induce pCD3ζ, pJun and pErk (Supplementary Fig. 4c,d). These in vitro results were confirmed using bone marrow chimeras, where OT-II thymocytes developed in a RIP-OVA host expressing the cognate antigen, ovalbumin in the thymus and the pancreas under the control of the rat insulin promoter (Fig. 4e). These chimeric mice contain Triplehi (and Tripleint) but not Triplelo T  cells in the thymus. Taken together, these data imply that Triplehi and Triplelo T  cells are likely generated by exposure to negatively selecting antigens; moreover, the resulting T  cells phenotype is most likely determined by the affinity of its TCR for self-antigen.

Triplehi Treg cells suppress lymphoproliferation

To compare the regulatory properties of these two populations, Foxp3DTR mice received sorted Triplehi or Triplelo T  cells from B6 mice (Supplementary Fig. 5a), which are unaffected by diphtheria toxin (DTx). Three days later, endogenous T  cells from the Foxp3DTR host were depleted by injecting DTx every other day. LN lymphocytes then were examined by flow cytometry 11 days following the onset of T  cells depletion (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Triplehi T  cells control the extensive proliferation of T cells and B cells in peripheral LNs of mice depleted of their endogenous T  cells (Fig. 5a), while Triplelo T  cells function poorly in this respect. As expected, Triplehi T  cells limit the activation of CD4+ T  cells (Fig. 5b,c). Taken together, these results show that Triplehi T  cells regulate lymphocyte homeostasis in peripheral LNs.

Triplelo Treg cells suppress induction of colitis

To examine whether any of these T  cell subsets control colitis, CD3-deficient (Cd3e–/–) mice were injected with sorted naive CD4+ T  cells (Supplementary Fig. 6a), a treatment, which results in weight loss (Fig. 6a) and colitis (Fig. 6b, upper left panel) as previously described7. Co-transfer of Triplelo (Fig. 6a, solid brown line; Fig. 6b, upper middle panel) but not Triplehi (Fig. 6a, solid red line; Fig. 6b, upper right panel) T  cells prevented weight loss and limited lymphocyte infiltration of the colonic mucosa. Analysis of LN cells from these mice indicated that co-transferred Triplelo T  cells facilitated the conversion of some CD4+ T  cells into iT  cells (Fig, 6c,d). Mice receiving TripleloT  cells had the highest percentage of iT  cells (Fig, 6c,d), very limited infiltration of the colonic mucosa (Fig. 6b, upper middle panel) and maintained their weight (Fig. 6a).

To test whether iT  cells were required to control colitis15, CD4+ T  cells isolated from Foxp3DTR mice were transferred into Cd3e–/–) mice (Supplementary Fig. 6a). These animals were additionally treated with DTx every third day to deplete any iT  cells developing from transferred Foxp3DTR CD4+T  cells. iT  cells depletion accelerated weight loss and development of colitis (compare solid blue Fig. 6a and dashed blue lines in Fig. 6e). Co-transferred B6 Triplelo T  cells (unaffected by DTx) were unable to control the development of colitis when iT  cells were depleted (compare solid brown Fig. 6a and dashed brown lines in Fig. 6e; compare upper middle and lower middle panels in Fig. 6b). The data support the idea that TripleloT  cells facilitate conversion of some CD4+T  cells into Foxp3+ iT  cells (Fig. 6d), which in aggregate limit development of colitis.

Taken together, the data (Fig. 5 and 6) argue for two populations of T  cells: Triplehi T  cells, which control lymphoproliferation in peripheral LNs and Triplelo T  cells, which limit the development of colitis (at least in a lymphopenic setting). It should be noted that the phenotypes of Triplehi T  cells are stable over the 11d time course of the experiment (Fig. 5) while Triplelo T  cells are stable over the 6 week time course of the experiment (Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. 6b). As Triplelo T  cells did not suppress lympho-proliferation and Triplehi T  cells did not suppress colitis, there was no evidence for a significant degree of trans-differentiation between the two subsets during the time frame of these experiments.

Triplehi and Triplelo CD4+ T cells in scurfy mice

Although Foxp3-deficient (scurfy) mice cannot develop T  cells due to the lack of functional Foxp3, they do carry out negative selection.21 For this reason, we wondered whether scurfy mice contain Triplehi- like and Triplelo- like CD4+ T cells despite their lack of a functional Foxp3 molecule. Flow cytometry analysis shows that these mice contain GITRhiPD-1hiCD25hi (Scurfy Triplehi) and GITRloPD-1loCD25lo (Scurfy Triplelo) CD4+ T cells. Scurfy Triplehi CD4+ T cells resembled B6 Triplehi T  cells in terms of PD-1, GITR, CD25, Helios, CD5 and CD62L protein expression (Fig. 7a). Given their lack of Foxp3 expression and suppressive capacity, Scurfy TriplehiCD4+ T cells may be similar to previously reported Treg ‘wannabes’.21,33,34 Scurfy Triplelo CD4+ T cells, on the other hand resembled CD4+ T  cells with respect to their expression of these markers (Fig. 7a).

To investigate their pathological activities, Scurfy Triplelo and Scurfy Triplehi CD4+ T cells were sorted (Supplementary Fig. 7a) and separately transferred into T cell deficient, Cd3e–/–) hosts (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Transferred Scurfy TripleloCD4+ T cells promoted weight loss (Fig. 7b) and colitis (Fig. 7c). Moreover, they accumulated in mesenteric LNs (Supplementary Fig. 7c) where ~35% of these cells express α β , an integrin that enables homing to the gut35 (Supplementary Fig. 7d). In contrast, transferred Scurfy TriplehiCD4+ T cells do not cause weight loss (Fig. 7b) and preferentially accumulate in peripheral but not mesenteric LNs (Fig. 7d, Supplementary Fig. 7c). Moreover, Scurfy TriplehiCD4+ T cells induce massive inflammation in the skin but only minimal inflammation in the colon (Fig. 7c, Supplementary Fig. 7e). Taken together, these results indicate that the absence of normal T  cells is not the sole cause of scurfy disease; the activity of dysregulated (T  cell-like) Scurfy Triplehi CD4+ T cells accounts for some of the pathology observed in these mice.

Discussion

We examined the functionality of T  cell subsets with distinct TCR repertoires and differing affinities for self-antigens. Our data suggest that Triplehi and Triplelo T  cells are generated as an offshoot of negative selection. The high affinity self-reactive TCRs expressed by Triplehi T  cells likely drive their selection in the thymus and their suppressive activity in peripheral LNs.36 On the other hand, thymic precursors expressing lower affinity self-reactive TCRs plausibly differentiate into Triplelo T  cells. Triplehi and Triplelo T  cells are distinct from central and effector T  cell subsets based on their expression of CD25, CCR7, CD103, Helios and Nrp-1 proteins.16 Foxp3-RFP Rag-GFP dual reporter mice, clearly show that Triplehi and Triplelo T  cell are present among de novo generated, Rag-GFP+, thymic T  cells. Antigen free mice contain virtually no foreign antigens (they lack a microbiome and are fed an elemental diet), but express normal frequencies of Triplehi and Triplelo T  cells; this demonstrates that their differentiation is driven exclusively by self-antigens. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Triplehi and Triplelo T  cells are generated in a programmed fashion, based on their affinity for self-antigens.

T  cells and CD4+ T  cells are differently selected and have dissimilar TCR repertoires.24,25 A comparison of the TCR repertoires expressed in thymic and peripheral (induced) T  cells is difficult due to the absence of specific markers for cell sorting.8,9,14,37,38 However, analysis of peripheral (assumed to be thymus-derived) and colonic (assumed to be peripherally induced) T  cells revealed different TCR repertories expressed in these two populations.26 Deep sequencing shows that the TCR repertoires of Triplehi, Triplelo T  and CD4+ T  cells indicates are distinct; this is expected if TCR specificity is linked to T  cell differentiation. The decreased TCR diversity among Triplehi T  cells may be due oligoclonal expansion; this is consistent with their increased proliferation in vivo.

Based on CD5 and Nur77-GFP reporter expression,31,32 the affinity hierarchy for self-reactivity is likely Triplehi T  cells > Triplelo T  cells > CD4+ T  cells. Exposing MHCII restricted TCR-tg thymocytes to threshold- (weak deleting), intermediate- (moderate deleting) or high- affinity (strong deleting) antigens generates Triplelo, Tripleint or Triplehi T  cells, respectively. The principle that thymocyte affinity for self-antigen determines cell fate also applies to T  cell development.

Whether different T  cell populations suppress different aspects of autoimmunity is not fully known.15 Acute T  cell ablation in Foxp3DTR mice leads to the activation of T cells specific for “available-antigens” including genome encoded self, environmental and food antigens.39 We show that the massive expansion of T  and B cells in T  cell ablated mice is controlled by transferring Triplehi, but not Triplelo T  cells. TriplehiT  cells may suppress lymphoproliferation in peripheral LNs by either modifying DCs towards a tolerogenic phenotype41 or by directly interacting with T  cells.39, 40, 42

A number of reports show that co-transfer of T  cells, in particular microbiota-specific T  cells prevents the onset or even cures mice from colitis.7, 43, 44 iT  cells are essential for maintaining immune homeostasis, especially at mucosal interfaces; additionally iT  cells contribute to fetal tolerance.5,12,13 In the gut, naive CD4+T cells are converted into iT  cell following TCR stimulation in the presence of TGF-β and IL-2; other compounds such as retinoic acid (RA) or short-chain-fatty-acids from microbiota mediate conversion as well.7 IL-10 is also a key player in maintaining lymphocyte homeostasis in the gut as IL-10 deficient mice suffer from spontaneous colitis.7 Our results clearly show that Triplelo T  cells suppress colitis induction. Triplelo T  cells by themselves do not control colitis induction, but function by promoting the generation of iT  cells from CD4+ T  cells. To our knowledge, there is no study, showing that a particular T  cell population can induce the conversion of CD4+ T  cells in iT  cell in vivo. M2a macrophages were shown to promote a supportive environment for iT  cells and directly contribute to immunological homeostasis in the gut.45 Nevertheless, how Triplelo T  cells facilitate the generation of iT  cells is still an open question.

T  cell-like ‘wannabe’ CD4+ T cells accumulate in scurfy mice.33,34 These T  cell-like Scurfy CD4+T cells are phenotypically similar to bona fide T  cells and even express similar TCRs.21 Transfer of T -like CD4+ T cells from scurfy mice resulted in colitis, but not the other features of scurfy disease.33 Here, we show that Scurfy Triplehi CD4+T cells are similar to bona fide Triplehi T  cells with respect to PD-1, GITR, CD25 and Helios expression. Transferred Scurfy Triplehi CD4+T cells proliferate extensively in peripheral LNs, infiltrate the skin and cause cutaneous lesions similar to those seen in scurfy mice. Interestingly, IL-2 deficient scurfy mice do not develop skin lesions, while IL-4-, IL-6-, IL-10-, Stat6- or CD103- deficient scurfy mice do46 suggesting that IL-2 acts as an important mediator of skin inflammation in scurfy mice. Scurfy Triplehi CD4+T cells likely require but do not produce their own IL-2, since they express Helios, a repressor of IL-2 transcription.34 This might explain the accumulation of scurfy Triplehi CD4+T cells around IL-2 secreting, skin resident DCs in the dermis.47 In contrast, scurfy TripleloCD4+T cells induce severe colitis within four weeks when transferred to T cell deficient recipients. It’s unclear whether scurfy Triplelo CD4+T cells are the scurfy equivalent to B6 Triplelo T  cells or to B6 CD4+ T  cells. A portion of Scurfy Triplelo CD4+T cells are likely to be microbiota specific, since germfree scurfy mice are less prone to develop colitis compared to scurfy mice housed under SPF conditions.26,36 Taken together, these results indicate that scurfy disease is pleiotropic. Although the absence of bona fide T  cells is the major contributor to the scurfy phenotype, the presence of dysregulated T  cells-like cells very likely initiates several pathological aspects of this disease.

In summary, our results show that the extent of self-reactivity underlies the development of two distinct populations of regulatory T cells. The highly self-reactive Triplehi T  cells control the homeostatic proliferation of lymphocytes in peripheral LNs, whereas the less self-reactive Triplelo T  cells facilitate the generation of iT  cells in order to maintain lymphocyte homeostasis in the colon. Scurfy mice contain dysregulated T  cells-like CD4+ T cells, which contribute to the pathology of scurfy disease.

All antibodies have been validated by their suppliers and references can be found on their website or on the online validation databases Antibodypedia and 1DegreeBio. Antibody dilutions were 1:100 for surface stainings and 1:50 for intracellular stainings. For BrdU experiments, mice were injected with 1mg/d BrdU (5-bromodeoxyuridine, BD Bioscience) for 3 days and cells were then stained for incorporated BrdU using a BrdU Flow Kit (BD Bioscience) followed by staining for intracellular markers. All antibodies were purchased from BD Bioscience, BioLegend, eBioscience or CellSignaling Technology. For flow cytometric analysis, a FACS CantoII (BD Bioscience) and FlowJo software (TreeStar) were used. For cell isolation, CD4+T cells were enriched using Dynabeads® Untouched™ Mouse CD4 Cells Kit (Life Technologies, Invitrogen) from cell suspensions from different sources (peripheral LN, mesenteric LN, spleen); subpopulations of enriched CD4 cells were further sorted on a FACSAriaIII or Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Cell numbers were determined using AccuCheck Counting Beads (Life Technologies, Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. All kits were used according to manufacturer’s instructions.

In vitro assays

Bone marrow derived DCs (BMDCs) were generated from bone marrow cells of 5-7 week old B6 or B6.MHCII KO mice. Bone marrow cells were cultured under maturation conditions for 10 days in full medium supplemented with GM-CSF (hybridoma supernatant, LUTZ-GMCSF, kindly provided by V.Horejsi). Autologous mixed lymphocyte reactions (auto-MLRs) were performed by co-culturing 1x105 syngeneic (B6 or MHCII KO) BMDCs with 3x105 CFSE labeled (Life Technologies, Invitrogen) magnetic bead enriched CD4 cells (Dynabeads, Invitrogen) in 96-well-U-shaped plates for 5 days. For in vitro, T  cell development experiments, 1x105 thymocytes from 3BK508TCR-tg mice were co-cultured with 1x105 B6 BMDCs in the presence of IL-2 (25U/ml, hybridoma X63 supernatant) and recombinant mouse TGF-β1 (10ng/ml, R&D Systems) for 48h with or without 1μM 3K (FEAQKAKANKAV), P2A (FEAAKAKANKAVD) or P-1A (FAAQKAKANKAVD) peptides (all obtained from Eurogentec). Re-aggregated thymic organ cultures were performed as previously described.58 In brief, RTOC were established from B3K508TCR-tg, MHCII KO thymocytes and thymic epithelial cells from B6 mice and were cultured in presence of P-1A (20 μM), P2A (2 μM) or 3K (0.2 μM) peptides for 7 days before analysis. All in vitro assays were performed at 37°C in 5% CO  using complete RPMI medium (GIBCO, Life Technologies).

Generation of bone marrow chimeric mice

For generating bone marrow chimeric mice, the protocol from Koehli et al.49 was adapted. Recipient mice (CD45.1 CD45.2) were lethally irradiated with 900 rad (GammaCell, Best Theratronics, CA). Bone marrow cells from 5-8 week old B6 mice (CD45.1) and OT-II Rag2–/– mice (CD45.2) were isolated and depleted of mature CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. A mixture of 9:1 of B6 and OT-II Rag2–/– bone marrow cells (4x106 total cells) were injected intravenously (i.v.) into irradiated recipient mice. Mice were analyzed 12-14 weeks after reconstitution and treated with antibiotics (Nopil, Mepha Pharma AG) in the drinking water until 2 weeks before analysis. The congenic markers CD45.1 and CD45.2 were used to identify T cells derived from different donor bone marrows as well as the host.

In vivo suppression assays

Foxp3DTR mice were injected intra-peritoneal (i.p.) with Diphtheria Toxin (DTx) (Calbiochem) every other day for 10-12 days (first and second injection 50μg/kg; subsequent injections 25μg/kg). In some groups, 2.5x105 sorted T  cells from pooled LNs were injected i.v. 3 days prior to first DTx injection. Mice were analyzed one day after last their DTx injection. For colitis experiments, 6-10 week old T cell deficient CD3ε–/– mice received (i.v.) 3.2x105 sorted naive CD4+ T cells from pooled LNs of B6Ly5.1 or Foxp3DTR Ly5.1 mice. In some groups, 0.8 x105 sorted T  cells from pooled LN were co-transferred. Recipients of naive Foxp3DTR CD4+ T cells (CD4+GFP–) were injected every third day with DTx (10μg/kg), i.p. For adoptive transfer of Scurfy CD4+ T cells, 6-10 week old T cell deficient CD3ε–/– were reconstituted with 5x105 sorted CD4+ subpopulations from pooled LNs of 2-3 week old sick Foxp3-deficient (scurfy) male mice. Recipient mice were weighed weekly at the same time of day and sacrificed when initial body weight droped more than 20% or at the latest six weeks after T cell transfer. The congenic markers, Ly5.1 and Ly5.2 were used to identify T cells from the different donors as well the host. Tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in parafin, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

Histology

Formalin-fixed tissues were processed, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and evaluated blindly.

Clonotype Analysis

Naive CD4+ (CD4+CD25–Foxp3– ), TripleloT  (CD4+CD25loFoxp3+GITRlo PD-1lo) or TriplehiT  (CD4+CD25hiFoxp3+GITRhiPD-1hi) cell populations were sorted from 3 replicate groups (2 mice per group) of single TCRβ-tg (B6.YAe62 tg+TCRα+/–) mice were sorted to 98% purity (FACS Aria, BD Biosciences). RNA was isolated using Trizol and precipitated with RNase free glycogen (Invitrogen) following the manufactures protocol. cDNA was prepared using oligo-dT’s (Promega) and Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen). cDNA was amplified with 20 rounds PCR with generic V 2 primer (5’-CCCTGGGGAAGGCCCTGCTCTCCTGATA-3’) and TCR Cα primer (5’-GGTACACAGCAGGTTCTGGGTTCTGGATG-3’). 1/10th volume of the first round PCR was amplified with an additional 20 rounds of PCR using barcoded primers, for post sequence identification of originating T cell population, containing Illunima PE read primer and P5/7 regions, respectively. The resulting 300bp fragment was gel purified (Gene Clean II, MP Biomedicals) and sequenced on a MiSeq using a single read 250bp run (Illumina). Sequence data sets were parsed by barcode using the program fastq-multx59 and clonotypes for each population were tabulated using TCRklass60.

Similarity and Diversity analysis of TCR clonotypes

The similarity of TCRs utilized within each population was quantified using the Morisita-Horn similarity index, 0 (minimal similarity) and 1 (maximal similarity). The Morisita-Horn (M-H) similarity indexes were calculated by tabulating the frequency in which the top 500 clonotypes of an individual population from one replicate sample was found in all other populations, using EstimateS Ver9.1.061 software. Statistical significance for M-H index values was assessed using a Mann-Whittney U test, GraphPad Prism version 6.04. The diversity of TCR repertoire for each population was measured using the top 500 most frequent clonotypes. The Shannon Entropy62 value for each sample was calculated as H = −Σpilog  p , where p  is the frequency of the clonotype within the top 500 clonotypes. Lower H values indicate lower diversity. Additionally, the Simpson's diversity index63 using the formula D  = 1 − Σ[n (n  − 1)]/[N(N − 1)], where n  is the TCR clone size of the ith clonotype and N is the total number of the top 500 clonotypes sampled. The index ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating high diversity.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6.0 (Graphpad software). If not other indicated, Students t test (unpaired, two-tailed) was used to assess statistical significance.
