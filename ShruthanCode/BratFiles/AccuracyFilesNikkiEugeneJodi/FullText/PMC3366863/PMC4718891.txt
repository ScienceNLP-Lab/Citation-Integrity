Polyclonal CD4 +  T cell tolerance is established by distinct mechanisms, according to self-peptide expression patterns

Abstract

Studies of mouse monoclonal CD4+ T cell repertoires have revealed several mechanisms of self-tolerance, however, which mechanisms operate in normal repertoires is unclear. Here, polyclonal CD4+ T cells specific for green fluorescent protein expressed in different organs were studied, allowing determination of the effects of specific expression patterns on the same epitope-specific T cells. Peptides presented uniformly by thymic antigen-presenting cells were tolerated by clonal deletion, whereas thymus-excluded peptides were ignored. Peptides with limited thymic expression induced partial clonal deletion and impaired effector but enhanced regulatory T cell potential. These mechanisms were also active for T cell populations specific for endogenously expressed self-antigens. Thus, immune tolerance of polyclonal CD4+ T cells is maintained by distinct mechanisms, according to self-peptide expression patterns.

Self-reactive CD4+ T cells are generated in the normal course of T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement1. Low affinity interactions between TCR and self-peptide-major histocompatibility class II (self-peptide:MHCII) ligands are essential for positive selection of T cells in the thymus1. High affinity TCR-self-peptide:MHCII interactions, however, can cause autoimmunity. Therefore, tolerance mechanisms have evolved to limit T cells with TCRs with high affinities for self-peptide:MHCII ligands.

Different tolerance mechanisms may be engaged depending on where a self-peptide:MHCII epitope is displayed. A developing thymocyte may die by apoptosis or differentiate into a regulatory T cell (T  cell) if its TCR binds strongly to a self-peptide:MHCII epitope displayed on particular antigen-presenting cells1, 2. Epitopes in this class may be derived from proteins expressed or taken up by MHCII+ thymic epithelial cells or dendritic cells. However, MHCII+ cells in the thymus might not display epitopes from all host proteins. Thus, T cells expressing TCRs with high affinities for certain self-epitopes may not be deleted in the thymus and exit to secondary lymphoid organs2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Some T cells in this class may be specific for epitopes from proteins that are not secreted or are expressed in locations with poor lymphatic drainage. Since these proteins would not reach antigen-presenting cells in secondary lymphoid organs, specific T cells would be retained in the repertoire in a fully responsive state of ignorance7, 8. Other tissue-restricted proteins that are secreted or found in dying cells may reach secondary lymphoid organs where they would be processed by antigen-presenting cells to form self-peptide:MHCII epitopes. CD4+ T cells that encounter and recognize these epitopes may differentiate into T  cells2 or become anergic due to a lack of innate immune system-derived costimulation1, 9.

Much of the evidence cited above has come from studies of transgenic mice expressing monoclonal TCRs specific for self-peptide:MHCII epitopes7, 8, 10. These mice could reveal tolerance mechanisms because of the large numbers of T cells available for study. However, this approach has several limitations. Because a TCR transgenic mouse contains a single TCR from a larger repertoire, it can only reveal tolerance mechanisms that apply to TCRs with that affinity for a self-peptide:MHCII epitope11. Further, it is clear that an abundance of T cells with the same TCR can create abnormal outcomes12, 13, 14. This issue has come to the fore in several studies showing that clonal deletion is not as prominent a mechanism in polyclonal T cell repertoires as has been reported for certain monoclonal T cell populations 4, 5, 15. These studies, however, have been limited to epitopes with ubiquitous patterns of expression.

A need therefore exists for a systematic study of tolerance within normal polyclonal CD4+ T cell repertoires specific for self-peptides with defined patterns of expression. Here, we carried out such a study using peptide:MHCII tetramer-based cell enrichment. Intrathymic deletion was the mechanism of tolerance for T cells specific for peptides from proteins expressed uniformly by thymic dendritic cells and/or medullary thymic epithelial cells, whereas ignorance was the mechanism for peptides from cytosolic or nuclear proteins expressed only outside the thymus. Partial intrathymic deletion and impaired effector but enhanced T  cell potential among remaining clones was the mechanism for many peptides from tissue-restricted proteins that were also expressed sparsely in the thymus. Thus, CD4+ T cells tolerate self-peptides with different expression patterns via different mechanisms.

RESULTS

eGFP transgenic mice model CD4+ T cell tolerance to self

Enhanced green, yellow, or cyan fluorescent proteins (eGFP, eYFP, CFP) were used as model self-antigens in transgenic mouse strains expressing these proteins and the I-Ab MHCII molecule. These proteins contain an I-Ab-binding peptide (HDFFKSAMPEGYVQE, eGFPp), which was incorporated into an I-Ab tetramer that was used to detect CD4+ T cells with TCRs specific for this epitope (Fig. 1a,b) 16. This experimental system allowed determination of the effects of different patterns of self-antigen expression on the same epitope-specific T cell repertoire. Another advantage of this approach was that wild-type C57BL/6 (B6) mice, which express the I-Ab molecule but not eGFP, could be used as controls to study the relevant T cell repertoire in the absence of the self-peptide.

Tolerance in the eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+ T cell repertoire was examined by immunizing 14 different transgenic strains expressing eGFP, eYFP, or CFP (Supplementary table 1) with eGFPp in complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA). Single cell suspensions of secondary lymphoid organs from immunized mice were stained with the eGFPp:I-Ab tetramer labeled with allophycocyanin, then with anti-allophycocyanin-coated magnetic beads. Tetramer-bound cells were enriched on magnetized columns, eluted, and stained with antibodies designed to identify T cells. T 1, T 17, follicular helper (T ), and T  cell differentiation by the eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+ T cells was assessed by intracellular staining of the lineage-defining transcription factors T-bet (Tbx21), RORγt (Rorc), Bcl-6, and Foxp3, respectively (Fig. 1c).

Wild-type B6 mice, for which eGFPp is a foreign peptide, had on average 23,000 eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD44hi CD4+ T cells in their secondary lymphoid organs 14 days after immunization (Fig. 1a). Most of these cells were Foxp3− effector T cells, although a small subpopulation of Foxp3+ T  cells was present (Fig. 1c). The Foxp3− population consisted of 10% RORγt+ T 17 cells, 22% T-bet+ T 1 cells, 30% Bcl-6+ T  cells, and 35% could not be assigned to a known lineage (Fig. 1c).

The eGFP-, eYFP-, or CFP-transgenic mice generated a spectrum of eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD44hi CD4+ effector T cell numbers in secondary lymphoid organs following immunization (Fig. 1a). At one end, insulin 1 (Ins1)eGFP mice produced the same number of cells as wild-type mice, indicating a complete lack of tolerance. At the other end, ubiquitin (UBC)eGFP mice generated fewer than 100 eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD44hi T cells, indicating a profound state of tolerance. The other 12 transgenic strains produced 200–10,000 eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD44hi T cells (Fig. 1a).

The eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD44hi T cells in the transgenic mice also displayed a range of phenotypes. T , T 1, T , and T 17 cells generated in each strain after priming with eGFPp in CFA were analyzed using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm17 to search for patterns of tolerance induction (Fig. 1d). Absolute cell numbers were used for this clustering to capture information about clonal proliferation and differentiation. This analysis revealed three major clusters. Cluster 1 was typified by Ins1eGFP mice and was characterized by wild-type numbers of T , T 1, and T 17 cells and relatively few T  cells (Fig. 1d,e). Cluster 2 was exemplified by Ins2eGFP mice and contained low numbers of T , T 1, and T 17 cells and relatively large numbers of T  cells (Fig. 1d,e). Cluster 3 was typified by UBCeGFP mice and characterized by profound reduction of all subsets (Fig. 1d,e). These results suggest that three major mechanisms account for CD4+ T cell tolerance to self-antigens with different patterns of expression.

Ignorance is the tolerance mechanism for Cluster 1

Cluster 1 contained wild-type mice and mice with patterns of very limited eGFP expression: Ins1eGFP mice express eGFP exclusively in pancreatic beta cells18, 19, whereas Forkhead box D1 (Foxd1)eGFP mice express eGFP during kidney and eye development20, 21. Because Ins1eGFP and Foxd1eGFP mice responded to eGFPp immunization like mice that did not express eGFP, it is likely that their eGFPp:I-Ab-specific T cell repertoires never encountered this epitope and were in a naive state. We tested this hypothesis in Ins1eGFP mice by enumerating eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+ T cells in unimmunized mice (Fig. 2a,b). Single cell suspensions of secondary lymphoid organs were stained with eGFPp:I-Ab tetramers labeled with allophycocyanin or phycoerythrin, then with anti-phycoerythrin and anti-allophycocyanin magnetic beads before magnetic enrichment. Cells were stained with the same tetramer labeled with two different fluorochromes to maximize the TCR specificity of the assay16. Ins1eGFP mice contained an average of 19 eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+ T cells in secondary lymphoid organs, like wild-type mice (Fig. 2b). These populations also had similar frequencies of naive-phenotype (CD44lo) cells (Fig. 2c). Together with the observation that Ins1eGFP and wild-type mice mounted comparable responses following immunization, these results indicated that tolerance in Cluster 1 was due to ignorance.

Partial clonal deletion and Treg induction shape Cluster 2

Cluster 2 was characterized by low numbers of effector cells and relatively large numbers of T  cells in mice primed with eGFPp. It consisted of several mice with tissue-restricted promoters that are also expressed sparsely in the thymus. Ins2eGFP mice express eGFP fused to the C peptide of pro-insulin in pancreatic beta cells22. They also express eGFP in a small number of medullary thymic epithelial cells19. Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)eGFP mice express eGFP in developing T  cells in the thymus, whereas CD207eYFP mice23 express eYFP in epidermal Langerhans cells and perhaps thymic dendritic cells. Smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 11 (Myh11)eGFP and zinc finger protein 423 (Zfp423)eGFP mice are expected to express eGFP at moderate levels in medullary thymic epithelial cells24. Purkinje cell protein 2 (Pcp2)eGFP mice, which express eGFP in cerebellar Purkinje neurons in the brain25 were also in this cluster. Ins2eGFP mice were selected for further analysis of the tolerance mechanisms operating in Cluster 2.

Evidence for intrathymic clonal deletion was sought by enumerating eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+CD8− thymocytes (Fig. 3). Wild-type mice contained an average of 16 eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+CD8− thymocytes and 20 peripheral CD4+ T cells, whereas Ins2eGFP mice had an average of 10 and 13 such cells (Fig. 3a–d). These results indicated that about 30% of eGFPp:I-Ab-specific T cell clones were deleted in Ins2eGFP mice. Foxp3+ eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+CD8− thymocytes were detected in wild-type and Ins2eGFP thymuses, although not in all mice due to the small size of this population. However, significantly more Ins2eGFP thymuses (40%) contained eGFPp:I-Ab-specific Foxp3+ CD4+CD8− thymocytes than wild-type thymuses (Fig. 3e,f). Thus, T  cells were spared from deletion or even increased in the presence of this self-antigen.

The clones that were deleted in Ins2eGFP mice might have had TCRs with the highest affinities for the eGFPp:I-Ab epitope. This possibility was addressed by measuring the mean fluorescence intensity of tetramer binding, which is a direct correlate of TCR affinity for peptide:MHCII26. Thymocytes could not be used for this purpose because they were too rare for an accurate measurement. The analysis was therefore performed on expanded populations of eGFPp:I-Ab-specific cells in immunized mice. No significant difference was found in the mean fluorescence intensity of eGFPp:I-Ab tetramer staining on cells from wild-type or Ins2eGFP mice immunized with eGFPp in CFA. Because CFA forms a long-lasting depot at the injection site27, persistent presentation of the eGFPp:I-Ab epitope may have given low affinity T cells an advantage thereby reducing the capacity to detect a subtle difference. The analysis was therefore repeated using an eGFP-expressing strain of attenuated (ΔactAΔinlB) Listeria monocytogenes (Lm-eGFP) that causes a very transient infection28. Lm-eGFP-induced clonal proliferation of eGFPp:I-Ab-specific T cells was significantly impaired in Ins2eGFP mice compared to wild-type mice (Fig. 4 a,b). Furthermore, the mean fluorescence intensity of eGFPp:I-Ab tetramer staining on cells from Ins2eGFP mice was lower than that of cells from wild-type mice (Fig. 4c). These results indicate that some clones with TCRs with high affinity for the eGFPp:I-Ab epitope are deleted in Ins2eGFP mice.

The fact that eGFP was likely expressed in the thymuses of Ins2eGFP mice under the control of the transcriptional regulator Aire led to an investigation of whether tolerance occurred in this organ in an Aire-dependent fashion. This question was first addressed by transplanting wild-type or Ins2eGFP thymuses into athymic B6-nude mice29. Eight-twelve weeks later, mice were primed subcutaneously with eGFPp in CFA. B6-nude recipients of wild-type thymus grafts generated large numbers of CD44hi eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+ T cells as seen in intact wild-type mice, whereas B6-nude mice that received Ins2eGFP thymus grafts produced a much smaller population (Fig. 5a). B6-nude recipients of Ins2eGFP thymus grafts produced higher numbers and frequencies of CD44hi eGFPp:I-Ab-specific T  cells than the recipients of wild-type thymus grafts (Fig. 5b,c). Foxp3− effector cell differentiation was also impaired in Ins2eGFP thymus graft recipients (Fig. 5d). Thus, much of the tolerance observed in Ins2eGFP mice was induced in the thymus.

The involvement of Aire was tested using Ins2eGFPAire−/− mice. These mice had comparable numbers of eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+CD8− thymocytes as wild-type and Aire−/− mice (Fig. 5e), demonstrating that clonal deletion in Ins2eGFP mice was Aire-dependent. Furthermore, thymic T  cell numbers in Ins2eGFPAire−/− mice were similar to wild-type levels   and clonal proliferation and differentiation of Foxp3− effector cells was very similar in Ins2eGFPAire−/− and Aire−/− mice following immunization (Fig. 5f–h). Therefore, much of the tolerance in Ins2eGFP mice was induced in the thymus by an Aire-dependent mechanism. Total numbers of Foxp3+ T  cells, however, were still elevated in some immunized Ins2eGFPAire−/− mice compared to wild-type mice, suggesting that a non-Aire-dependent mechanism could play a role in this aspect of tolerance (Fig. 5g).

Overall, these studies indicate that tolerance in CD4+ T cell repertoires specific for self-epitopes expressed in a limited fashion in the thymus is associated with intrathymic deletion of some clones and impaired effector, but enhanced T  cell generation from the remaining clones.

Clonal deletion regulates self-antigens in Cluster 3

Cluster 3 was characterized by a profound clonal proliferation defect following immunization. This cluster contained mice that express eGFP under the control of non-Aire-regulated promoters in MHCII+ cells in the thymus. UBCeGFP and beta actin (ACTB)eGFP mice express eGFP in thymic dendritic cells, medullary thymic epithelial cells, and all other nucleated cells30, 31. CD11c (Itgax)eYFP mice express eYFP in thymic dendritic cells32, whereas choline acetyltransferase (Chat)eGFP 33, 34, cadherin 1 (Cdh1)CFP 35 and AireeGFP 36 mice express eGFP in medullary thymic epithelial cells. UBCeGFP mice were chosen for further analysis as a representative of Cluster 3.

eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+CD8− thymocytes were enumerated to determine whether intrathymic clonal deletion was responsible for the proliferation defect observed in UBCeGFP mice (Fig. 6). Wild-type mice contained an average of 20 eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+CD8− thymocytes, while UBCeGFP mice had less than one. A few eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+ T cells were, however, detected in the secondary lymphoid organs of UBCeGFP mice (Fig. 6c,d). These results suggest that most eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+CD8− thymocytes are deleted in the thymus, although a few escape and accumulate in the secondary lymphoid organs. The profound lack of proliferation following immunization indicated that these few cells were unresponsive. These results indicate that MHCII-bound peptides from proteins that are abundantly expressed in MHCII+ cells in the thymus induce a profound state of immune tolerance mediated in large part by intrathymic clonal deletion.

Thymic self-antigen expression correlates with tolerance

The specific mechanisms of tolerance associated with self-epitopes in Clusters 1–3 appeared to depend on self-antigen expression by MHCII+ cells in the thymus. To test this hypothesis, representatives from these clusters were examined for expression of eGFP and eYFP by EpCAM+ thymic epithelial cells and thymic dendritic cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thymuses from wild-type and Ins1eGFP mice, members of Cluster 1, contained fewer than 10 I-Ab+ eGFP+ or eYFP+ EpCAM+ epithelial cells or dendritic cells, consistent with the ignorant phenotype of eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+ T cells in these mice (Fig. 7a–c). At the other end of the spectrum, ItgaxeYFP and ACTBeGFP mice, members of Cluster 3, contained more than 300,000 I-Ab+ eYFP+ or eGFP+ dendritic cells and EpCAM+ epithelial cells in their thymuses, likely accounting for the substantial clonal deletion observed in these mice (Fig. 7a–c). Finally, Ins2eGFP, Pcp2eGFP, and CD207eYFP thymuses contained several hundred I-Ab+ eGFP+ or eYFP+ EpCAM+ epithelial cells, and CD207eYFP thymuses also contained ~3,000 I-Ab+ eYFP+ dendritic cells (Fig. 7a–c). A significant inverse correlation was observed between the number of eGFP+ or eYFP+ thymic antigen-presenting cells and the number of eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+ T cells present 14 days after immunization (Fig. 7d). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the number of MHCII+ thymic antigen-presenting cells expressing a particular self-antigen determines the responsiveness of the corresponding CD4+ T cell population.

Tolerance to true self-antigens occurs by these mechanisms

Information from the eGFP system was then used to identify the tolerance mechanisms for CD4+ T cell repertoires for 6 genuine self-peptide:I-Ab epitopes. B6 mice were immunized with the self-peptides or foreign peptides as controls, and the compositions of the resulting Foxp3− effector and Foxp3+ T  cell populations were determined. The percentages of T , T 1, T 17, and T  cells were analyzed using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to determine if the responses to the self-peptides aligned with the clusters defined in the eGFP system. Percentages of cells in each subset, rather than absolute numbers, were used for this comparison because the sizes of the pre-immunization repertoires for the natural epitopes were unknown. The use of absolute numbers of cells in each subset would have been problematic for epitopes with populations that had the same differentiation potential but simply varied in size.

Peptides from the constant region of IgM (IgMHp), which is very abundant in the blood, or ATP-binding cassette sub-family G, member 1 (ABCG1p), which is highly expressed in thymic dendritic cells and medullary thymic epithelial cells24, elicited fewer than 200 CD44hi cells that bound the relevant peptide:I-Ab tetramers (Fig. 8a). These peptides elicited too few CD44hi cells to accurately determine the percentages of each subset and thus were not analyzed by the clustering algorithm. The minimal responses to these self-epitopes, however, indicated that these CD4+ T cell repertoires underwent extensive intrathymic clonal deletion as in the eGFP transgenic mice in Cluster 3.

The unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis produced 2 clusters. The first (‘foreign’) cluster contained responses to foreign peptides from listeriolysin O protein of Listeria monocytogenes (LLOp)37, 38, calnexin from Blastomyces dermatitidis (CLGN(BD)p), and a model peptide called 2W39, as well as the Cluster 1 (Fig. 1d) responses to eGFPp in wild-type, Ins1eGFP, and Foxd1eGFP mice (Fig. 8b). The second (‘self’) cluster consisted of responses to the eGFP epitope in the eGFP transgenic mice that comprised Cluster 2 (Fig. 1d).

A peptide from junctophilin 2 (JPH2p), which is expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle and the heart40, elicited 5,000 CD44hi cells that bound the relevant peptide:I-Ab tetramer (Fig. 8a). This population produced a T  and effector cell composition similar to that of populations specific for foreign peptides, as evidenced by its assignment to the ‘foreign’ cluster (Fig. 8b). These results indicate that CD4+ T cell tolerance to the junctophilin 2 epitope in B6 mice is maintained by ignorance.

Peptides from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and proteolipid protein (PLP), which are expressed in the nervous system, and protein disulfide associated isomerase 2 (PDIA2), which is expressed in the pancreas and digestive tract41, elicited 1,000–10,000 peptide:I-Ab-specific CD44hi cells (Fig. 8a). These populations contained reduced Foxp3− effector and increased T  cell frequencies compared to populations specific for non-mouse peptides (Fig. 8b). The responses to these self-epitopes were placed in the ‘self’ cluster, which also contained responses to the eGFP epitope in the eGFP transgenic mice that comprised Cluster 2 in Figure 1d. Thus, tolerance to these endogenously expressed peptides resembled that associated with limited thymic eGFP expression.

DISCUSSION

Here we demonstrate that tolerance in the normally diverse CD4+ T cell repertoire is attributed to one of three mechanisms depending on the expression pattern of the self-epitope.

A profound state of tolerance existed in CD4+ T cell repertoires specific for epitopes from proteins that are easily accessed or expressed by many MHCII+ cells in the thymus. This tolerance manifested as nearly complete deletion of self-epitope-specific T cells in the thymus, which likely resulted from abundant self-epitope display on MHCII+ thymic dendritic cells and/or medullary thymic epithelial cells. Although substantial clonal deletion was reported for human and murine T cells specific for self-epitopes from the Y-chromosome or driven by the ACTB promoter4, 5, 15, it was not as extensive as that observed here for an epitope expressed from the UBC promoter. This promoter may have led to an extraordinarily large number of self-epitopes on thymic antigen-presenting cells, causing deletion of nearly all self-epitope-specific T cells. Alternatively, deletion within the small eGFPp:I-Ab-specific CD4+ T cell repertoire might have been more efficient because of limited inter-clonal competition.

A state of immunological ignorance existed within CD4+ T cell repertoires specific for epitopes from non-Aire-regulated proteins that are expressed exclusively outside of the thymus. In addition, these epitopes are probably not displayed in secondary lymphoid organs because their parent proteins are cytosolic and expressed by cells that do not turn over in a way that allows local dendritic cells to produce the epitopes or access draining lymph nodes. The complete lack of presentation of these self-epitopes dictates that corresponding CD4+ T cells exist in a naive and fully responsive state of ignorance. Self-epitopes in this cluster are essentially foreign to the relevant T cell repertoires.

A complex form of tolerance controlled CD4+ T cell repertoires specific for epitopes from proteins with tissue-restricted patterns of expression, but that are also expressed by small numbers of MHCII+ thymic antigen-presenting cells. Analysis of the Ins2eGFP member of this group revealed that tolerance was associated with intrathymic deletion of ~30% of the epitope-specific clones. Partial clonal deletion was also observed in studies of a polyclonal CD8+ T cell population specific for a tissue-restricted epitope11. In our studies, the deleted clones had TCRs with the highest affinities for the eGFPp:I-Ab ligand. Thymocytes with high affinity TCRs might be especially sensitive to deletion because they can garner sufficient signal from single encounters with rare thymic antigen-presenting cells. In contrast, deletion of thymocytes with lower affinity TCRs may require numerous encounters42, 43, which are unlikely to occur when relevant thymic antigen-presenting cells are rare, as in Cluster 2.

The partial deletion of the epitope-specific polyclonal population studied in Ins2eGFP mice depended on Aire, indicating involvement of medullary thymic epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that expression of eGFP from the Ins2, Pcp2, and CD207 loci occurred in only a small number of thymic epithelial cells and dendritic cells, likely allowing eGFPp:I-Ab-specific T cells with lower affinity TCRs to escape deletion. In agreement with this possibility, eGFPp:I-Ab-specific T cells were nearly completely deleted in AireeGFP mice, which express eGFP in all medullary thymic epithelial cells36. Although medullary thymic epithelial cells were a likely source of eGFP in these models, antigen transfer to neighboring dendritic cells could have mediated deletion44.

The non-deleted T cells specific for Cluster 2 epitopes generated Foxp3− effector T cells less well than corresponding wild-type T cells. This defect extended to T  cells but was particularly striking for T 1 and T 17 cells. Other work has shown that T 1 clones tend to have higher affinity TCRs than T  cells45. Thus, it is possible that the lower affinity TCRs found on epitope-specific T cells in this cluster were incapable of generating enough signals to form T 1 and T 17 cells. Alternatively, these cells might have been induced into a partially anergic state due to persistent self-epitope recognition in a non-inflammatory environment as suggested by previous TCR transgenic studies46, 47, 48. If so, the thymic transplant experiments presented here suggest that this anergy induction occurs mainly in the thymus.

Enhanced T  cell proliferation after immunization was another component of tolerance to the epitopes in Cluster 2. One explanation for this feature is that the pre-immunization repertoires of T cells specific for these epitopes are enriched for thymus-derived T  cells, which might occur when cells are shunted into the T  cell lineage following moderately high affinity self-epitope recognition in the thymus49. The observation that T  cells were detected more frequently in the pre-immunization eGFPp:I-Ab-specific population in Ins2eGFP mice than in wild-type mice is consistent with this possibility. This is only a tentative conclusion however, because the eGFPp:I-Ab-specific populations were very small in both situations. It is also possible that Foxp3− cells in the eGFPp:I-Ab-specific population had enhanced potential to differentiate into induced T  cells after immunization. In any case, our results suggest that T  cells are especially important for tolerance to epitopes from tissue-restricted antigens that also exhibit limited thymic expression.

The mechanisms of tolerance identified for the epitopes studied here all appeared to be induced in the thymus. It is possible that other epitopes are tolerated by mechanisms that operate in the secondary lymphoid organs, for example, epitopes from paternal fetal proteins that appear in pregnant females. Peripheral deletion and anergy appear to be the tolerance mechanisms for these antigens50.

Analysis of thymus cell numbers was carried out between 3 and 5 weeks of age.

Immunizations

Mice were injected subcutaneously with 100 μl (split over 2 sites) of CFA (Sigma-Aldrich) emulsion containing 100 μg of peptide (GenScript) in DPBS (Life Technologies). Mice were immunized with the specific peptides contained in the tetramers below with the following exceptions: MOGp (GWYRSPFSRVVHL) and CLGN(BD)p (LVVKNPAAHHAI).

Infections

The ΔactAΔinlB strain of Lm-eGFP (PL1113) was provided by Peter Lauer. Briefly, the eGFP construct (hyperSPO1 promoter-eGFP)54 was cloned into the pPL1 vector55 and integrated at the comK locus in the actA-inlB-double mutant56. Mice were injected i.v. with 1×107 Lm-eGFP bacteria and analyzed 6–7 days post-infection.

Cell enrichment and flow cytometry

Single cell suspensions were prepared from pooled murine spleens and lymph nodes (axillary, brachial, inguinal, cervical, mesenteric, pancreatic, and para-aortic) or thymuses by mechanical disruption. Cells were stained for 1 hour at room temperature with allophycocyanin-conjugated tetramers. In some experiments cells were also stained with anti-CXCR5 (2G8, BD) antibody or phycoerythrin-conjugated tetramers. Tetramer-binding cells were enriched on magnetized columns as described previously58. For thymic epithelial cell and dendritic cell analysis, thymuses were harvested and enzymatically digested as previously described59. Single cell suspensions were stained with a biotinylated antibody to CD11c (HL3, BD) and an allophycocyanin-labeled antibody to EpCAM (G8.8, Biolegend). Cells were incubated with anti-biotin and anti-allophycocyanin cocktails and magnetic beads (StemCell Technologies). Cells were enriched using the EasySep system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (StemCell Technologies).

Antibodies

Tetramer-enriched samples were stained for surface markers for 30 minutes on ice using antibodies to: CD4 (GK1.5, BD), CD8 (53–6.7, BD), CD90.1 (HIS51), CD90.2 (53–2.1, 30-H12), CD3e (145-2C11, BD), CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (N418), F4/80 (BM8), CD44 (IM7, BD), CD45.1 (A20, Biolegend), CD45.2 (104), B220 (RA3–6B2), and/or PD1 (J43). Cellular viability was confirmed using GhostDye Red 780 (Tonbo Biosciences). For transcription factor expression analysis, stained cells were fixed and permeablized using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were stained overnight at 4°C with antibodies to T-bet (4B10, Biolegend), Foxp3 (FJK-16s), RORγt (Q31-378, BD), and Bcl-6 (K112-91, BD). For thymic dendritic cell and thymic epithelial cell analyses cells, following enrichment cells were stained with antibodies to CD11c (N418), CD19 (6D5, Biolegend), I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2, Biolegend), CD8 (53–6.7, BD), CD90.2 (53–2.1, 30-H12), CD11b (M1/70), and CD45.2 (104, BD). Antibodies were purchased from eBioscience unless otherwise indicated. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a Fortessa (BD). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar).

Thymus transplants

Thymus transplants were performed as previously described 60. Briefly, thymus lobes were harvested from prenatal (post-conception day 18) pups generated by crossing Ins2eGFP and CD90.1+ B6 mice. An incision was made on the left abdomen of anesthetized 4–6 week old female B6-nude to expose the kidney and the donor thymic lobes were grafted beneath the kidney capsule. The muscle layer was sutured and the skin was closed using surgical clips. Thymic engraftment was assessed 6 weeks after transplantation by examining peripheral blood for the presence of mature αβ T cells by flow cytometry. Donor genotypes were determined post-transplantation.

Statistics

Two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t tests, one-way ANOVA, Chi-square test, and linear regression were performed using Prism (Graphpad) software.

Hierarchical Clustering

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and heatmap generation was carried out using the ‘HierarchicalClustering’ and ‘HierarchicalClusteringViewer’ modules from GenePattern (http://genepattern.broadinstitute.org)17, 61, 62.
