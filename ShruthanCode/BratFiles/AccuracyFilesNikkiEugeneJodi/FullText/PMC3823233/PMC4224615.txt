Broad and potent HIV-1 neutralization by a human antibody that binds the gp41-120 interface

Abstract

The isolation of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is providing important insights regarding the specificities that underlie broad neutralization of HIV-1 (reviewed in1). Here we report a broad and extremely potent HIV-specific mAb, termed 35O22, which binds novel HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) epitope. 35O22 neutralized 62% of 181 pseudoviruses with an IC <50 μg/ml. The median IC  of neutralized viruses was 0.033 μg/ml, among the most potent thus far described. 35O22 did not bind monomeric forms of Env tested, but did bind the trimeric BG505 SOSIP.664. Mutagenesis and a reconstruction by negative-stain electron microscopy of the Fab in complex with trimer revealed it to bind a conserved epitope, which stretched across gp120 and gp41. The specificity of 35O22 represents a novel site of vulnerability on HIV Env, which serum analysis indicates to be commonly elicited by natural infection. Binding to this new site of vulnerability may thus be an important complement to current mAb-based approaches to immunotherapies, prophylaxis, and vaccine design.

Induction of a potent neutralizing antibody response capable of recognizing highly diverse isolates of HIV-1 is among the very most important goals of HIV vaccine research. This represents a considerable challenge given the extraordinary antigenic variability of the Env surface glycoprotein. However, approximately 20% of the HIV-infected population does develop a humoral immune response capable of recognizing highly diverse strains2–6. In the past several years improved patient cohorts2–6, HIV-specific B cell isolation7–9, and IgG cloning techniques 10,11 have permitted extraordinary progress in isolation of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNabs) from these individuals. Thus far, these primarily fall into four categories based upon the position of their epitopes on the Env protein, a trimer of gp120 and gp41 heterodimers that is the target of neutralizing antibodies. These sites include the CD4-binding site on gp1208,12 (of which VRC01 is an example), the glycan-containing regions of V1V2 on gp120 (of which PG9 and PG16 are examples), the V3 region centered on the N332 glycan of gp1207,13 (of which PGT121 is an example) and the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) on gp41 (of which 10E8 is an example)14,15. It remains unclear to what extent these four categories represent the prevalent and immunodominant sites of Env vulnerability through which broad neutralizing responses are mediated, or whether additional specificities exist16–19

Here we report the isolation of a broad and potently neutralizing HIV-specific mAb, 35O22, that binds a novel epitope. The neutralizing activity of 35O22 is highly complementary to the activities of other known bNabs. We used mutagenesis, crystallography and EM to define the Env site targeted by 35O22. Our results indicate that 35O22 neutralization occurs by a novel mode of trimer recognition along a conserved face on contiguous areas of gp41 and gp120.

To further understand the specificities that underlie broadly neutralizing antibody responses we applied a technique to identify human mAbs of interest from peripheral blood B cells without prior knowledge of the target specificity9. IgG+ B cells of a donor (N152), with broad and potent neutralizing serum and from whom recently described 10E8 antibody was cloned20, were sorted and expanded. The supernatants of B cell microcultures were screened for neutralizing activity and IgG genes from positive wells were cloned and re-expressed. In addition to the 10E8 antibody, 8 clonal family variants of an additional antibody with neutralization activity were found, among which the 35O22 antibody was the most potent and broad (Supplementary Table 1a,b). This antibody was derived from IGHV-1-18*02- and IGLV-2-14*02 germline genes, and was highly somatically mutated in variable genes of both heavy chain (35%) and λ light chain (24%) compared to germline. The 35O22 antibody possessed a heavy-chain complementarity-determining 3 region (CDR H3) composed of 14 amino acids (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 2) and an insertion of 8 amino acids in framework 3 (FR3). High levels of somatic mutation and FR3 insertions are features of other HIV-specific bNabs7–9,12,13,21,22. Autoreactivity or polyreactivity are properties of several HIV-specific antibodies23,24 that could limit their use in therapies or prophylaxis. However, 35O22 bound Hep-2 epithelial cells only modestly (Extended Data Fig. 1a) and did not bind a panel of autoantigens (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Against a large panel of pseudoviruses, 35O22 neutralized 62% of 181 isolates with an IC <50 μg/ml (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 3). In numerous cases where the IC  of 10E8 was >1 μg/ml, that of 35O22 was 100 to 1000-fold lower (Supplementary Table 1b and Supplementary Table 3), indicating their activities were highly complementary. It is likely that 35O22-like antibodies account for much of the breadth and potency of the N152 patient serum against clades A and B (Supplementary Table 3), whereas 10E8-like antibodies may account for much of the breadth against clade C isolates. Overall, the median IC  of 35O22 for sensitive viruses was 0.033 μg/ml, which is among the most potent thus far described (Fig. 1b).

The neutralizing spectrum of 35O22 was then compared to those of other bNabs. The IC  of 35O22 against a panel of diverse isolates did not correlate with those of the bNabs VRC01, 10E8, PG9, and PGT121 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). In addition, a neutralization-based clustering analysis revealed that 35O22 clustered separately from other bNabs (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Further, 35O22 did not compete with other known bNabs when bound to virus-like particles (VLPs) (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Its neutralization of many pseudoviruses did not exceed 80% even at high concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 3a) and its potency increased when pseudoviruses were produced in the presence of the glycosidase inhibitors NB-DNJ or kifunensine, consistent with recognition of high mannose (Extended Data Fig. 3b)25. However, neutralization was unaffected by mutation of N-linked glycosylation sites critical for binding of known bNabs (Extended Data Fig. 4c) 7,13. Taken together these data suggested that 35O22 binds glycans, but its specificity differed from all previously characterized bNabs.

Mutation of four predicted sites of N-linked glycosylation on HIV  Env diminished neutralization potency; N88A, N230A, N241A, and N625A (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 4). This result suggested that 35O22 recognized elements of both gp120 and gp41, a property that may be consistent with several very recently isolated antibodies 16–19. When mutations were introduced in the 5 residues on either side of these four sites, the V89A, T90A, K227A, T232A, and S243A mutations each diminished neutralization (Supplementary Table 4). With the exception of V89A and K227A, it is likely the impact of each of these mutations was to disrupt the Asn-X-Ser/Thr glycotransferase sequon. There was no impact of T627A suggesting a glycan may not be present at 625 and 35022 may make a protein contact at this position. Overall, similar results were obtained using replication competent HIV  viruses (Supplementary Table 5). Examination of the sequences of resistant pseudoviruses within clade C did not reveal a clear pattern of variation at each of the positions found to affect 35O22 neutralization or within the glycosylation sequon. It is therefore possible that the resistance of clade C viruses is mediated by other factors such as variations in glycosylation pattern or conformation.

35O22 did not bind to a panel of soluble recombinant Env proteins (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b, c) suggesting these do not have the appropriate conformation or glycosylation for binding. However, the 35O22 antibody did bind a recently described stabilized, cleaved, soluble trimer, BG505 SOSIP.664 (Fig. 2b)26, Despite a plateau in neutralization below 50% (Extended Data Fig. 3a) and lacking glycans at positions 230 and 241, binding to BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer had numerous characteristics consistent with its activity against the HIV  pseudovirus. 35O22 binding was increased to trimer produced in cells treated with kifunensine or cells deficient in glycan processing, and diminished by mutations at positions 88 and 625 (Fig. 2c). 35O22 did bind to BG505 SOSIP trimer lacking the furin cleavage site (BG505 SOSIP.SEKS). In surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments, 35O22 also bound to immobilized BG505 SOSIP.664 with high affinity (K =5.6nM) (Fig. 2d). Binding was markedly lower to the gp120-41  protomer and no binding was detected to the gp120 monomer (Fig. 2e). It bound the uncleaved BG505 SOSIP.SEKS but no binding was observed to the uncleaved form lacking the SOSIP mutations (Fig. 2f). These observations, combined with the lack of binding of 35O22 to all other soluble forms of Env tested, suggested this antibody requires a trimeric structure for binding its epitope on gp120 and gp4127.

To provide an atomic-level understanding of the structure of the 35O22 antibody, we crystallized the Fab of 35O22. Crystals were obtained that diffracted to 1.55Å resolution (Supplementary Table 6). Overall the structure of 35O22 Fab revealed a relatively flat antigen-combining site, lacking long protruding loops, and flanked by the complementarity-determining region 1 on the light chain (CDRL1) and the 8 amino acid insertion in FR3 of the heavy chain (Fig. 3a). The surface of the antigen combining site was heavily altered by somatic mutation and two pairs of cysteines introduced by somatic mutation in CDR L1 and L3 formed disulphide bonds (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6a).

We next sought to determine the structure of the antibody-antigen complex. The ability of 35O22 to bind the BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer permitted imaging of the antibody-antigen complex by negative stain electron microscopy (EM). The reconstruction of these images showed that three 35O22 Fabs bound to the trimers at sites close to the predicted viral membrane (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 6b). Superposition of the negative stain reconstruction of the soluble BG505 SOSIP.664 with 35O22 Fab onto the BaL EM tomogram of the viral spike (Extended Data Fig. 6b) suggested the viral membrane to be in close contact to the 35O22 Fab light chain. Tyr68 and Trp69 in the light chain and FR3 tyrosines at residues 65 and 72 form potential surfaces of membrane association. The 35O22 heavy chain was in close proximity to the four sites observed to contribute to the 35O22 epitope in mutagenesis experiments (N88, N234, N241 and N625). The CDR H3 was predicted to interact with N625 and CDRH2 with N88. The 8 amino acid insertion in the framework 3 heavy chain is located close to residues 88–90 on gp120. Reversion of this insertion to germline markedly diminished neutralization against most pseudoviruses in our panel (Supplementary Table 7). 35O22 binds a surface on the Env spike that is distinct from two other antibodies, 8ANC195 and PGT151, reported to bind gp120 and gp41 (Extended Data Fig. 7) 16–18.

Analysis of the 35O22 site of vulnerability (Extended Data Fig. 8a–c) indicated it was highly conserved. The glycans predicted at positions 88, 241, and 625 were found to be among the most highly conserved N-linked glycosylation sequons of 4265 HIV-1 sequences in the Los Alamos database (Supplementary Table 8). Despite this high level of conservation, analysis of the Env gene of the patient’s plasma virus showed that the predicted amino acid sequence varied at the critical 35O22 contacts. In addition to the previously published 10E8 escape mutations, an N230Q is predicted in one sequence, N241D in half of the sequences, and an N624D and N625Q in all sequences (Extended Data Fig. 9a). When these mutations were introduced into HIV  pseudoviruses there was a drop in neutralization with the greatest effect caused by the N625Q mutation found in all of the plasma sequences (Extended Data Fig. 9b). These data suggest that the autologous virus has escaped neutralization by 35O22.

To gain insight into the prevalence of the 35O22 specificity, we added the 35O22 neutralization fingerprint to the 10 that we had previously identified (Extended Data Fig. 8d–e)28. Notably, 13 of the sera (38%) showed significant 35O22-neutralization signals (>0.2). This level of prevalence was substantially higher than for the V1V2-directed response (typified by the PG9 antibody) or that of the 8ANC195 antibody. However, it was lower than the prevalence of responses to the MPER (50% prevalence), the CD4-binding site (56% prevalence), or the V3 glycan site (82% prevalence). The neutralizing activity of sera was also measured against HIV  pseudoviruses bearing N88A, N230A, N241A, or N625A mutations (Extended Data Table 1). These mutations caused a greater than 5-fold increase in ID  in more than half of donors, with a high level of concordance between the impact of each of these mutations within a given serum. These results suggested that 35O22 is unlikely to be the product of a unique B cell repertoire or infecting virus, but rather arises commonly among patients that develop HIV-specific neutralizing antibodies.

To better understand the mechanism of 35022’s activity, we examined the timing of its binding and neutralization during virus fusion. Given the proximity of the 35O22 epitope to the membrane, it was important to perform these experiments in the context of Env expressed on cells or virions. In these settings, MPER-specific antibodies have limited access to the native trimer and bind best after the conformational changes induced by CD4 attachment29. Binding of 35O22 to Env expressed on the cell surface was low and similar to the MPER antibody 2F5 (Fig. 4a). 35O22 binding to VLPs was weak compared to that of VRC01 but similar to that of 10E8 (Fig. 4b). 35O22 binding was slightly inhibited by sCD4 binding, suggesting the 35O22 epitope is not induced by sCD4 under these experimental conditions. 35O22 neutralization was partially eliminated by washing of pseudovirions prior to infection, a result consistent with limited access to Env on free virions (Fig. 4c)29. However, if 35O22 was incubated with VLPs, permitted to bind to target cells, and then after 2 hours the cells were washed, there was little impact on neutralization similar to all other antibodies except the MPER 10E8 antibody (Fig. 4d). Similar to 2G12 and 10E8, 35O22 activity was relatively high in the post-CD4 format, consistent with prior work showing that virus-sCD4 complexes are more sensitive to neutralization than virus alone30. In a post-CD4/CCR5 assay, only 10E8 neutralized, consistent with prior observations (Fig. 4d) 30. Taken together with the structural data, these results suggest that in the context of a lipid membrane, 35O22 binds Env poorly prior to CD4 attachment. However, following trimer attachment to CD4, 35O22 binds to an early intermediate that exposes the 35O22 epitope possibly by raising the Env spike within the viral membrane (Fig. 4e).

The 35O22 antibody and its specificity have a number of implications for the use of antibodies in HIV therapy, prophylaxis, and efforts to stimulate HIV-specific antibodies with vaccines. Its novel binding site and spectrum of activity against HIV strains suggest it could complement other antibodies used in passive immunotherapy or prophylaxis. In addition, the antibody is extremely potent suggesting its activity in vivo may therefore persist even at low concentrations. Perhaps most importantly, the novel epitope bound by the 35O22 antibody represents a new site of vulnerability that could potentially be targeted by HIV vaccines. The high prevalence of 35O22-like neutralizing activity in HIV-infected cohorts, increases the likelihood that production of similar antibodies could be induced by vaccination. In addition, the highly specific recognition by 35O22 of BG505 SOSIP.664 suggests that this soluble, cleaved trimer antigenically resembles the native Env trimer at the gp120-gp41 interface. Given the binding characteristics of 35O22, these results underscore the possibility that immunogens structurally similar to the native trimer are required for elicitation of such antibodies27.

METHODS

Study patients

We selected the plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the HIV-1-infected patients enrolled in the National Institute of Health under a clinical protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00029445) approved by the Investigational Review Board in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID-IRB). All participants signed informed consent approved by the NIAID-IRB. The criteria for enrolment were as follows: having a detectable viral load, a stable CD4 T-cell count above 400 cells μl−1, being diagnosed with HIV infection for at least 4 years, and off antiretroviral treatment for at least 5 years. Donor N152 was selected for B-cell sorting and antibody generation because his serum neutralizing activity is among the most potent and broad in our cohort. At the time of leukapheresis, he had been infected with HIV-1 for 20 years, with CD4 T-cell counts of 325 cells μl−1, plasma HIV-1 RNA values of 3,811 copies ml−1 and was not on antiretroviral treatment.

Memory B-cell staining, sorting and antibody cloning

Staining and single-cell sorting of memory B cells were performed following a detailed protocol recently published9. Briefly, a total of 140,000 CD19+IgA−IgD−IgM− memory B cells were sorted and re-suspended in medium with IL-2, IL-21 and irradiated 3T3-msCD40L feeder cells, and seeded into 384-well microtitre plates at a density of 4 cells per well. After 13 days of incubation, supernatants from each well were screened for neutralization activity using a high-throughput micro-neutralization assay against HIV-1  and HIV-1 . From the wells that scored positive in both the HIV-1  and HIV-1  neutralization assay the variable region of the heavy chain and the light chain of the immunoglobulin gene were amplified by RT–PCR and re-expressed as described previously10. The full-length IgG was purified using a recombinant protein-A column (GE Healthcare).

Generation of pseudoviruses and VLPs

HIV-1 Env pseudoviruses were generated by co-transfection of 293T cells with pSG3 delta Env backbone and a second plasmid that expressed HIV-1 Env at a ratio of 2:1. 72 h after transfection, supernatants containing pseudoviruses were harvested and frozen at −80 °C until further use. Glycosidase-inhibitors were added to the cells at the time of transfection at flowing concentration, 25 μM kifunensine, 500 μM NB-DNJ and 20 μM swainsonine. JRCSF mutants were produced by altering the JRCSF Env plasmid using QuikChange Lightning mutagenesis according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Agilent). VLPs for ELISA assays were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells with a pCAGGS Env-expressing plasmid and the subgenomic plasmid pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- as previously described31.

Neutralization assays

Neutralization activity of monoclonal antibodies or serum was measured using single-round HIV-1 Env-pseudovirus infection of TZM-bl cells as described previously32. HIV-1 Env pseudoviruses were generated by co-transfection of 293T cells with an Env-deficient backbone (pSG3ΔEnv) and an expression plasmid for the Env gene of interest. HIV  viruses were generated by transfection of a single plasmid containing the entire viral genome. At 72 h after transfection, supernatants containing pseudovirus were harvested and frozen at −80 °C until further use. In the neutralization assay, heat-inactivated patient serum or monoclonal antibody was serially diluted five fold with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium–10% FCS (Gibco), and 10 μl was incubated with 40 μl of pseudovirus in a 96-well plate at 37 °C for 30 min. TZM-bl cells were then added and plates were incubated for 48h. Assays were then developed with a luciferase assay system (Promega), and the relative light units (RLU) were read on a luminometer (Perkin Elmer). Washing of pseudovirions to determine access by antibody to the trimer on free virus was performed as described previously33. Neutralization in various formats to determine the timing and mechanism of neutralization were performed as described previously30,34. Briefly, in the standard “leave in” format monoclonal antibodies were mixed with VLPs 1h prior to infection of CF2.CD4.CCR5 cells with no subsequent washing. Alternatively, in a “cell wash” format, virus and antibody were incubated with target cells for 2h, followed by a wash to remove any unattached virus. In the post-CD4 format, VLPs were premixed with 3 μg/ml of sCD4 for 15 min., then incubated with antibody for 1h before adding to cells that lack CD4 but express CCR5 (CF2.syn.CCR5 cells). In the post-CD4/CCR5 format, SOS VLPs were permitted to attach to cells for 2h, unbound VLPs were washed away and graded concentrations of antibodies were added before infection was activated with DTT.

Prediction of prevalence of 35O22-like antibodies in patient serum

An antibody neutralization fingerprint, the pattern with which an antibody neutralizes a panel of diverse viral strains, was used to delineate the structural epitope recognized by that antibody 28,35. For each serum, neutralization on a panel of 21 HIV-1 strains was represented as a combination of the neutralization fingerprints for a reference set of antibody specificities targeting the other four major sites of Env vulnerability as well as the 35O22 fingerprint, to obtain an estimate of the relative contribution of each of these specificities to neutralization by the given serum. The neutralization behavior of sera was deconvoluted from a cohort of 34 donors, each with neutralization breadths of greater than 50%.

Binding assays

HIV  gp160 extracellular domain (gp140) foldon trimer, gp120 and gp41 monomers were produced as described previously36. HIV (clade B), HIV  (CRF01_AE), HIV  (clade C), HIV  (clade C), HIV  (clade E) gp120 proteins; and the HIV  (clade A), HIV  (clade C), HIV  (clade D) and HIV  (clade F) gp140 monomers were obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and Reagent Program. For ELISA assays each antigen (2 μg ml−1)was coated on 96-well plates overnight at 4 °C. Plates were blocked with BLOTTO buffer (PBS, 1% FBS, 5% non-fat milk) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with antibody serially diluted in disruption buffer (PBS, 5% FBS, 2% BSA, 1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature. 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody was added for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed between each step with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS. Plates were developed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Sigma) and read at 450 nm. ELISA assays using the BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer and mutants were performed as described previously26,27. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed at 25°C on a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare) using D7324 or anti-Histidine capture as previously described37. For the SPR experiment presented in Fig. 2d an anti-histidine capture was used (R = ~500 RU) and in Fig. 2e,f a D7324 capture was used (R  = ~150 RU for trimer and protomer; 130 RU for gp120 in 2e and R  = ~500 RU in 2f). ELISA assays using VLPs were performed as previously described30,31.

Autoreactivity assays

Reactivity to HIV-1 negative human epithelial (HEp-2) cells was determined by indirect immunofluorescence on slides using Evans Blue as a counterstain and FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Zeus Scientific)23. Slides were photographed on a Nikon Optiphot fluorescence microscope. Kodachrome slides were taken of each monoclonal antibody binding to HEp-2 cells at a 10-s exposure, and the slides scanned into digital format. The Luminex AtheNA Multi-Lyte ANA test (Wampole Laboratories) was used to test for monoclonal antibody reactivity to SSA/Ro, SS-B/La, Sm, ribonucleoprotein (RNP), Jo-1, double-stranded DNA, centromere B, and histone and was performed as per the manufacturer’s specifications and as previously described23. Monoclonal antibody concentrations assayed were 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25 μg ml−1. 10 μl of each concentration were incubated with the luminex fluorescent beads and the test performed per the manufacturer’s specifications.

Structure determination and analysis

The antigen-binding fragment of 35O22 (Fab) was prepared using HRV3C digestion, as previously described38. HRV3C was introduced in the hinge region of the heavy chain plasmid DNA. Both light and heavy chain plasmids were cotransfected in 293F as described previously. The antibody, 35O22 with HRV3C IgG was purified over protein A, cleaved with HRV3C and the flow-through collected and run onto a size-exclusion chromatography (S200). Purified 35O22 Fab set up for 20 °C vapour diffusion sitting-drop crystallizations on the Honeybee 963 robot. A total of 576 initial conditions adapted from the commercially available Hampton (Hampton Research), Precipitant Synergy (Emerald Biosystems) and Wizard (Emerald Biosystems) crystallization screens were set up and imaged using the Rockimager (Formulatrix), followed by hand optimization of crystal hits. Crystals were grown in 15% isopropanol, 25% PEG 3350, 0.2 M Ammonium citrate pH 4.5 diffracted to 1.55 Å resolution in a cryoprotectant composed of mother liquor supplemented with15% 2R-3R-butanediol. After mounting the crystals on a loop, they were flash cooled and data were collected at 1.00 Å wavelength at SER CAT ID-22 beamlines (APS) and processed using HKL-2000 39. Structures were solved through molecular replacement with Phaser 40,41, using a previously obtained free structure of VRC01 germline as a search model. Structure solution identified one Fab per asymmetric unit in a P4 2 2 lattice. Refinement of the structure was undertaken with Phenix, with iterative model building using Coot42. Refinement resulted in an R  value of 16.65% (R =18.22%). The structure was validated with MolProbity43, yielding 98.1% and 100 % of residues falling within most favoured Ramachandran regions and allowed Ramachandran regions, respectively. All graphics were prepared with Pymol (PyMOL Molecular Graphics System).

Electron microscopy and image processing

Negative stain EM grids were prepared as previously stated 44. Data were collected using a FEI Tecnai T12 electron microscope operating at 120 keV, with an electron dose of ~30 e−/Å2 and a magnification of 52,000× that resulted in a pixel size of 2.05 Å at the specimen plane. Images were acquired with a Tietz TemCam-F416 CMOS camera using a nominal defocus range of 800 to 1000 nm using the Leginon interface (ref). Image processing was carried out as described previously 45. The final reconstruction was performed using 4746 unbinned particles, refining for 40 iterations with C3 symmetry applied. The resulting density was ~19 Å resolution at a Fourier shell correlation (FSC) cut-off of 0.5. Fab fitting was carried out using the Fit function in Chimera, using 0.0115 contour level for the map. The Fab orientation where the heavy chain is towards gp120 (as shown in Figure 3b) was chosen on the basis of the two correlation coefficients (0.95)(471 of 7058 atoms outside contour). vs. 0.91 (1012 of 7058 atoms outside contour). In the alternate orientation (light chain towards gp120), the FR3 insertion did not fit within the density. The man-9 glycans were modeled onto the BG505 SOSIP.R6.664 (PDB ID 4NCO)46 using the GLYCAM-Web server(http://www.glycam.com). Dominant sites of vulnerability to neutralizing antibody elicited during chronic infection in Extended Data Fig. 8 is shown in the context of an EM tomogram from the BAL viral spike 47.
