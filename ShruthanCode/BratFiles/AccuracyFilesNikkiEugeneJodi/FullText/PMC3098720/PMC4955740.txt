Hydrophobic CDR3 residues promote the development of self-reactive T cells

Abstract

Studies of individual T cells receptors (TCRs) have shed some light on structural features that underlie self-reactivity. However, general rules that predict whether TCRs are self-reactive have not been fully elucidated. Analyses of thymocytes expressing all V  family members show that the interfacial hydrophobicity of amino acids at positions 6 and 7 of the CDR3β segment robustly promotes the development of self-reactive TCRs. An index based on these findings distinguishes V 2+, V 6+ and V 8.2+ regulatory T cells from conventional T cells, as well as T cells selected on a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allele associated with mouse type-1 diabetes from those selected on a non-autoimmune promoting MHC. These results provide a means for distinguishing normal and autoimmune-prone T cell repertoires.

The ability of αβ T cell repertoires to target pathogen-derived peptides displayed on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules is acquired through the highly regimented process of T cell development. CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes express a unique T cell receptor (TCR) comprised of a TCRα and TCRβ chain, each generated through variable-diversity-joining (V(D)J) recombination1. This process creates repertoires of TCRs that have a graded scale of reactivity for self-peptides presented by host MHC molecules (self-pMHC). DP thymocytes expressing these receptors are then subject to thymic selection2, 3, 4, 5.

TCR transgenic models and in vivo reporters of TCR signaling, including those tracking the expression of the immediate early gene Nr4a1 (Nur77) and CD5, suggest that positive selection matures thymocytes with a range of moderate self-pMHC avidities or affinities4, 5. Naïve T cells are thought to mature following relatively weak TCR-self-pMHC interactions, whereas on average, anti-inflammatory lineages such as regulatory T cells (T  cells) are thought to require increased TCR signals than naïve T cells for development2, 3, 4. DP thymocytes that fail to signal through engagement with self-pMHC, or receive very strong TCR signals are eliminated by developmental arrest and negative selection, respectively. Self-pMHC driven positive selection allows mature T cells to be MHC restricted, and results in a T cell repertoire that continually interacts with self-pMHC ligands4, 5, 6. As such, T cell homeostatic cues derived from self-pMHC interactions maintain T cell functionality; naïve T cells that receive the strongest homeostatic signals from self-pMHC ligands are optimally poised for responses to pathogens7, 8, 9 and T  cells require continuous signaling through the TCR to limit the intrinsic auto-reactivity within the conventional T cell repertoire10, 11.

Given the immense diversity of MHC alleles and self-peptides12, how structural features of TCRs and T cell signaling networks coalesce to produce a graded scale of self-reactivity is less clear6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. To gain insights into the structural properties of TCR self-reactivity, we studied individual T cells and TCRs with distinct self-pMHC recognition properties. These include two TCRs, YAe62 and B3K506, which are reactive to a model foreign peptide, 3K, a variant of the Eα  peptide in which the P2, P5 and P8 residues carry a lysine, presented by IAb. DP thymocytes expressing the B3K506 TCR differentiate into naïve CD4+ T cells in C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, DP thymocytes expressing the YAe62 TCR are eliminated by negative selection in C57BL/6 mice18. Structural analyses showed that the YAe62 TCR primarily uses TCRβ residues to bind to IAb-3K, whereas the B3K506 TCR more evenly uses both the TCRα and TCRβ chains19. Observing that the YAe62 TCR is self-reactive and binds IAb-3K primarily using TCRβ-pMHC interactions, has led us to hypothesis that variable residues within TCRβ chains can bias fully rearranged TCRs to be self-reactive. Although the mechanisms by which TCR sequence might influence the self-reactivity of T cells remains unclear, previous experimental and computational studies suggest that particular amino acid residues within the TCR-pMHC interface may promote pMHC cross-reactivity18, 20, 21, 22.

Here we tested whether biochemical features of complementary determining region 3 in the TCRβ chain (CDR3β) influenced the ability of TCRs to recognize self-pMHC ligands. We identified key “signature sequences” at positions 6 and 7 of TCR CDR3β that promote or limit self-reactivity. We observed that the frequency at which self-reactive T cell receptors were generated directly correlated with the interfacial hydrophobicity of these residues. This finding allowed the skewing events of T cell positive and negative selection to be indexed based on the biochemical features and usage of each of the 400 possible CDR3β P6–7 doublets. Examination of C57BL/6 mice revealed that positive selection enriches the naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell repertoires with TCRs that carry CDR3β P6–7 doublets that promote moderate self-reactivity. CD4+ T  cell and naïve CD4+ T cell repertoires that develop in NOD mice or mice expressing the NOD MHC showed a further enrichment in TCRs carrying hydrophobic CDR3β P6–7 doublets that promote self-reactivity, as compared to naïve CD4+ T cells in C57BL/6 mice. These results provide insights into the mechanism by which repertoires of TCRs are created with differing strengths of self-reactivity, and reveal how self-reactivity biases are reflected in normal and autoimmunity-prone T cell repertoires.

Results

YAe62β+ DP thymocytes strongly react with self-pMHC

We hypothesized that the YAe62β chain biases TCRs to recognize self-pMHC ligands. To test this, we compared DP thymocyte activation and the development of mature T cells in transgenic mice that express the YAe62β chain or the B3K506β chain (YAe62β and B3K506β mice, respectively). In YAe62β mice, approximately one third of the DP thymocytes expressed the activation markers CD69 and Nur77-GFP, a nuclear proxy of the strength of TCR signals23, indicating they had received robust TCR signals from self-pMHC ligands, and are thus defined as self-reactive.

The frequency of self-reactive YAe62β+ DP thymocytes is three-fold and four-fold increased relative to DP thymocytes in wild-type C57BL/6 mice and B3K506β mice, respectively (Fig. 1a,b). As measured by Nur77-GFP expression, YAe62β+ DP thymocytes interacting with self-pMHC generated increased TCR signals compared to wild-type C57BL/6 and B3K506β+ DP thymocytes, (Fig. 1c,d). However, because the total number of mature CD4+ or CD8+ single positive thymocytes generated in YAe62β and B3K506β mice was similar, many of the self-reactive YAe62β+ thymocytes may be undergoing negative selection. Mirroring the DP thymocyte self-reactivity profiles, the number of CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ thymic T  cells produced by YAe62β mice was 4-fold more than B3K506β mice (Fig. 1e). In addition, splenic CD44lo CD62L+ naïve CD4+ T cells from YAe62β mice, and to a lesser extent naïve CD8+ T cells and T  cells, expressed higher levels of Nur77-GFP (Fig. 1f–j) and CD5 (Fig. 1k–n), as compared to equivalent T cells in B3K506β mice. These data suggest that T cells expressing the YAe62β chain have a higher affinity or avidity for self-pMHC in the H-2b background as compared to B3K506β+ T cells.

We next tested whether the inclusion of YAe62β chain into TCRs induces self-reactivity only on an IAb background, or promotes a broader self-pMHC recognition to different MHC alleles. To address this question, we analyzed the expression of CD69 and Nur77-GFP on YAe62β+, wild-type C57BL/6 and B3K506β+ DP thymocytes, isolated from B2m−/− H2-Ab1−/− (MHC-deficient) mice, following incubation with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) expressing various MHC haplotypes. TCR+ CD69neg Nur77-GFPneg DP thymocytes isolated from B2m−/− H2-Ab1−/− mice (defined as pre-selection thymocytes) were used to ensure they had not previously engaged self-pMHC molecules. Approximately 25–35% of YAe62β+ pre-selection thymocytes were reactive to BMDC expressing H-2b, as well as H-2g7 and H-2d MHC molecules (Fig. 2a,b). In contrast, only 5–10% of the B3K506β+ pre-selection thymocytes showed responses to BMDC expressing each of the MHC haplotypes tested, with pre-selection thymocytes expressing polyclonal TCRβ chains in between. Furthermore, ~25% of YAe62β+ pre-selection thymocytes expressed CD69 and Nur77-GFP following incubation with B2m−/− and H2-Ab1−/− BM-DC (Fig. 2a,b), indicating that the ability of the YAe62β chain to promote recognition self-pMHC ligands is not MHC class specific. In addition, self-pMHC activated YAe62β+ pre-selection thymocytes expressed higher levels of Nur77-GFP, as compared to similarly activated B3K506β+ pre-selection thymocytes (Fig. 2c). These data argue that properties encoded in the YAe62β chain promote a high frequency of randomly paired TCRs to engage self-pMHC ligands that is independent of MHC allele being recognized.

The CDR3β P6–7-doublet FW promotes TCR recognition of self-pMHC

To identify features that can predispose TCRs to recognize self-pMHC ligands, we compared the YAe62β and B3K506β chain sequences. The TCRβ chains are members of the V 8 family – the YAe62β is a V 8.2 while the B3K506β is a V 8.1 – and have CDR3β segments comprised of 13 amino acids counting from the conserved V  Cys to J  Phe. The major difference occurs within the CDR3β at positions 6 and 7; the YAe62β chain carries a Phe and Trp (FW), whereas the B3K506β chain carries two Ser (SS) (Fig. 3a). These two residues are important for ligand recognition, as they are centrally located within the TCR-pMHC interface (Fig. 3b,c).

If the CDR3β residues 6 and 7 (referred to as CDR3β P6–7 doublet) have a deterministic role in regulating self-pMHC recognition, swapping the CDR3β P6–7 doublet between YAe62β and B3K506β chains should reverse the intrinsic self-reactivity associated with these chains. To test this, TCRβ retrogenic mice were constructed using TCRB−/− B2m−/− H2-Ab1−/− donor BM and recipient hosts, that expressed the YAe62β and B3K506β chains carrying either the FW or SS CDR3β P6–7 doublet (YAe62β-FW, YAe62β-SS, B3K506β-FW and B3K506β-SS mice, respectively). Pre-selection thymocytes isolated from these mice were then cultured with BMDC expressing various MHC haplotypes. We observed that only 4–6% of YAe62β-SS pre-selection thymocytes expressed CD69 and Nur77-GFP following culture with BMDC expressing H-2b, H-2g7 and H-2d MHC molecules (Fig. 3d). In contrast, 20–30% of B3K506β-FW pre-selection thymocytes were activated by similar BMDC (Fig. 3e). In addition, self-pMHC activated YAe62β-FW and B3K506β-FW pre-selection thymocytes expressed greater amounts of Nur77-GFP as compared to similar thymocytes expressing the YAe62β-SS and B3K506β-SS chains (Fig. 3. f,g). Thus, the CDR3β P6–7-doublet FW increases the frequency and the affinity or avidity of TCR recognition of self-pMHC ligands.

CDR3β P6–7 doublets routinely interact with pMHC residues

We next investigated whether the positioning of the CDR3β P6–7 doublet within the TCR-pMHC interface is dependent upon the TCR V  or CDR3β length. 53 human and mouse TCRs that express a range of V s and CDR3β lengths, bound to MHC class I and MHC class II ligands were analyzed (Supplementary Table 1). Within this group, all 53 TCRs used either CDR3β P6 or P7 to contact the pMHC, and in 43 structures, both residues interact with the pMHC (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 1). These CDR3β P6–7 doublet residues collectively make a similar number of contacts with the peptide and with the MHC (Fig. 4b).

Analyses further revealed at least two structural constraints within TCRs that underpin the localization of the CDR3β P6–7 doublet within TCR-pMHC interfaces. Within V  domains, residues 87–93, which include the first four amino acids of the CDR3β, are part of the conserved β sheet structure defining the Ig domain and are locked in an anti-parallel β strand with V  residues 29–35 via a hydrogen-bonding network (Fig 4c,d). This positioning of the V  87–93 β strand is secured by an internal disulfide bond between V  Cys21 and Cys90, which connects the V  B and F strands at the center of the Ig domain (Supplementary Fig. 1)24. These results suggest that the locations of these structural elements are conserved throughout TCRs, and as such the CDR3β P6–7 doublet was consistently located at a surface-exposed position within the TCR binding site.

Hydrophobicity of CDR3β P6–7 doublets predicts self-reactivity

CDR3β P6–7 doublets were highly diverse in the 53 TCR-pMHC structures analyzed, as they are primarily derived from the Dβ gene segment and random N-additions1. To test if CDR3β P6–7 doublets function as a tunable measure (or index) of self-reactivity of the TCR repertoire, we used next-generation sequencing to identify the frequency at which each amino acid is expressed at CDR3β residues P6 and P7 on pre-selection thymocytes and pre-selection thymocytes that expressed CD69 and Nur77-GFP following incubation with fibroblasts that express H2-Kb, H2-Db, H2-Kd, I-Ab, I-Ad or I-Ag7 (classified as self-reactive). We initially analyzed thymocytes repertoires expressing mouse Vβ2, Vβ6 and Vβ8.2, to identify motifs that promote the development of self-reactive TCRs (Supplementary Table 2). This approach was used such that confirmatory experiments could test whether identified motifs that regulate self-reactivity are dependent or independent of TCR expressing a particular V  family.

We observed that similar amino acids were enriched or depleted, up to ~e±1.5-fold at CDR3β P6 and P7, in pre-selection thymocytes that upregulated CD69 and Nur77-GFP following culture with MHC-expressing fibroblasts, as compared to unstimulated pre-selection thymocytes, irrespective of whether the thymocytes express a V 2+, V 6+ or V 8.2+ TCR (Fig. 4e,f and Supplementary Table 3). The frequency at which pre-selection thymocytes were activated by self-pMHC correlated with the interfacial hydrophobicity of CDR3β P6 and P7 residues, as well as octanol/water partitioning, a classic measure of the hydrophobic effect (Fig. 4g,h and Supplementary Fig. 2)25.

A self-reactivity index that accounts for the amino acids expressed at both CDR3β P6 and P7 was developed. We multiplied the fold change in amino acid usage at CDR3β P6 and P7 (defined in Fig. 4e,f) for each of the 20 amino acids. This resulted in a self-reactivity index value for the 400 potential CDR3β P6–7 doublets (Fig. 4e–i). This approach was used because TCR rearrangement creates many CDR3β P6–7 doublets at very low frequencies (<10−6), which precludes observing differential expression due to statistical uncertainties (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). Because the level of self-reactivity is a continuous scale, accuracy and completeness equations were used to identify threshold values of e0.4 and e−0.375 to categorize CDR3β P6–7 doublets as ones that promote, are equal to, or reduce the level of self-reactivity that naturally occurs in the pre-selection thymocytes repertoire (Supplementary Fig. 3c,d and Methods). These threshold values were chosen because they provided >96% accuracy, and simultaneously retained 73% of CDR3β P6–7 doublets that show significant enrichment and 52% of CDR3β P6–7 doublets that show significant depletion (Supplementary Figs. 3c,d and 4).

To initially test the predictive value of the self-reactivity index, we constructed and analyzed V 8.2-SW, V 8.2-EQ, V 8.2-AW and V 8.2-EG retrogenic mice using TCRB−/− B2m−/− H2-Ab1−/− donor BM and recipient hosts. The V 8.2-SW and V 8.2-EQ, as well as the V 8.2-AW and V 8.2-EG TCRβ chains differ only at the CDR3β P6–7 doublets (Fig. 5a,b). 13–30% of pre-selection thymocytes isolated from V 8.2-SW or V 8.2-AW mice upregulated CD69 and Nur77-GFP expression following culture with BMDC expressing the H-2b, H-2g7, H-2d, H-2k and H-2q haplotypes (Fig. 5c,d). In contrast, only 2–6% of pre-selection thymocytes carrying the V 8.2-EQ or V 8.2-EG chains expressed CD69 and Nur77-GFP. In addition, self-pMHC activated pre-selection thymocytes expressed higher amounts of Nur77-GFP when carrying the V 8.2-SW or V 8.2-AW TCRβ chain, when compared to pre-selection thymocytes carrying V 8.2-EQ or V 8.2-EG chains (Fig. 5e,f).

We next tested the fidelity of the self-reactivity index for V 1–V 20 TCRs. We first evaluated the length of CDR3β segments carried by pre-selection thymocytes and self-reactive pre-selection thymocytes. We observed that ~98% of all pre-selection thymocytes, as well as pre-selection thymocytes that expressed CD69 and Nur77-GFP following incubation with H2-Ab1−/− BM-DC (MHCI activated) or B2m−/− BM-DC (MHCII activated), carried CDR3β segments that range from 11–17 amino acids (Fig. 6a). Based on these findings, we analyzed TCRs carrying CDR3β segments that range from 11–17 amino acids. Comparing the frequency of different doublets in the same repertoire is not informative (see Methods). Therefore, we then employed Bayesian statistics (see Methods) to identify and plot CDR3β P6–7 doublets whose frequencies in V 2+ pre-selection thymocytes were significantly enriched or depleted as compared to MHCI- and MHCII-activated V 2+ pre-selection thymocytes (Fig. 6b). A hypergeometric test of these plots revealed that CDR3β P6–7 doublets predicted to promote self-reactivity by our calculated index were significantly enriched in MHCI- and MHCII-activated repertoires, while CDR3β P6–7 doublets predicted to limit self-reactivity were significantly depleted (Fig. 6c). This approach was then used to individually analyze and plot the enrichment of CDR3β doublets expressed by V 1-V 20+ TCRs, partitioned by CDR3β length, in MHCI-activated (Fig. 6d) and MHCII-activated pre-selection thymocytes (Fig. 6e), as compared to unstimulated pre-selection thymocytes. Hypergeometric test of the data revealed that CDR3β P6–7 doublets predicted to promote self-reactivity by our calculated index were significantly enriched in V 1–V 20+ pre-selection thymocytes that react with MHC class I or MHC class II alleles, compared to unstimulated pre-selection DP thymocytes. In contrast, CDR3β P6–7 doublets predicted to limit self-reactivity were depleted from the MHCI- and MHCII-activated pre-selection thymocytes repertoires (Fig. 6d,e). Thus, the self-reactivity index identifies self-reactivity biases of TCRs irrespective of the V , CDR3β length or the MHC class or allele being recognized.

Differential usage of CDR3β P6–7 doublets by T cells subsets

Thymic selection may bias mature T cell repertoires to carry TCR with certain types of amino acids within the antigen-binding site. To test this, we compared the frequency of CDR3β P6–7 doublets expressed on pre-selection thymocytes, isolated from B2m−/− H2-Ab1−/− mice, with those expressed on mature CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from MHC expressing mice. Compared to pre-selection thymocytes, V 2+, V 6+ and V 8.2+ TCRs expressed by splenic naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell isolated from C57BL/6 mice were depleted of the CDR3β P6–7 doublets that limit self-reactivity (Fig. 7a,b). We further partitioned the CDR3β P6–7 doublets into twelve groups, based on e0.2-fold changes in self-reactivity index enrichment factors, which correlates with the interfacial hydrophobicity of the doublet (Fig. 7c). This approach indicated that naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell repertoires in C57BL/6 mice were enriched in CDR3β P6–7 doublets that moderately promote self-reactivity, and are depleted of CDR3β P6–7 doublets with the weakest interfacial hydrophobicity ( ). These data suggest that positive selection matures thymocytes with a range of moderate self-pMHC avidity or affinity4, 5.

TCRs expressed on splenic CD25+ Foxp3+ CD4+ T  cells isolated from C57BL/6 mice (and three other genetic backgrounds) carried increased frequencies of hydrophobic CDR3β P6–7 doublets that promote self-reactivity, compared to pre-selection thymocytes (Fig. 7f), and CD4+ T cells isolated from the same mice (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Fig. 5a). TCRs expressed on splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from Bim−/− mice26, which have deficiencies in thymic negative selection, were enriched in the most hydrophobic CDR3β P6–7 doublets compared to TCRs expressed on splenic T cells isolated from C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 7 h,i). Importantly, biased usage of CDR3β P6–7 doublets by mouse CD4 T cells or T  cells was observed across the full range of TCR rearrangement frequencies (Fig. 8a,b). In addition, TRBV10+, TRBV19+ and TRBV28+ TCRs, which are homologues of mouse V 8.1, V 6 and V 7, respectively, expressed on human CD4+ CD127lo CD25+ T  cells isolated from the blood of seven donors also showed significant enrichment in hydrophobic CDR3β P6–7 doublets and were depleted in CDR3β P6–7 doublets that limit self-reactivity as compared to naïve CD4+ CD25−CD45RO− CD27+ CCR7+ CD95− T cells isolated from the same donors (Fig. 8c,d and Supplementary Table 4).

To further validate the hypothesis that CDR3β P6–7 doublets affect the maturation of CD4+ T cell populations, we reconstitute irradiate TCRB−/− mice with YAe62β-FW, B3K506β-SS, V 8.2-SW, V 8.2-EQ, V 8.2-AW or V 8.2-EG retrogenic bone marrow mixed 50/50 with T cell depleted bone marrow from C57BL/6 mice. Splenic CD4+ T cells expressing a YAe62-FW, V 8.2-SW and V 8.2-AW chain expressed higher levels of CD5, as compared to similar CD4 T cells expressing a B3K506-SS, V 8.2-EQ or V 8.2-EG chain (Supplementary Fig. 5b). In addition, 15–25% of the peripheral CD4+ T cells that express a YAe62-FW, V 8.2-SW or V 8.2-AW chain, but only 3–5% of CD4 T cells expressing a B3K506-SS, V 8.2-EQ or V 8.2-EG chain had a T  cell phenotype (Fig. 8e–g). Thus, the identity of the CDR3β P6–7 doublet affects thymocytes maturation and differentiation into conventional CD4+ T cell versus T  cell repertoires.

NOD CD4+ T cells are enriched in hydrophobic CDR3β P6–7 doublets

To investigate if the self-reactivity index could reveal autoimmune-prone T cell repertoire in mice, splenic naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were isolated from non-obese diabetes (NOD) mice and C57BL/6 mice, and V 2+, V 6+ and V 8.2+ TCRs were sequenced. Compared to C57BL/6 CD4+ T cells, splenic NOD CD4+ T cells were enriched in CDR3β P6–7 doublets that promote self-reactivity (P < 10−19) and depleted in P6–7 doublets that limit self-reactivity (P < 10−11) (Fig. 8j). In contrast, NOD CD8+ T cell repertoires did not show and increased usage of self-reactivity promoting CDR3β P6–7 doublets in comparison to C57BL/6 CD8 T cells (Fig 8k). Because a general defect in thymic deletion in NOD mice would be predicted to affect both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell repertoires, the specific effect on NOD CD4+ T cells suggested that the phenotype is mediated by the autoimmunity-promoting, I-Ag7, MHC molecule.

To address the role of the NOD MHC, we compared CDR3β P6–7 doublet usage by splenic CD4 T cells isolated from the reciprocal MHC congenic B6.NOD-(D17Mit21-D17Mit10)/LtJ (B6.H-2g7), NOD.B10Sn-H2b/J (NOD.H-2b), NOD and C57BL/6 mice. V 2+, V 6+ and V 8.2+ CD4+ T cells that develop in B6.H-2g7 mice were enriched in CDR3β P6–7 doublets that promote self-reactivity, relative to similar CD4+ T cells that develop in C57BL/6 mice (P < 10−16, Fig. 8l). In contrast, NOD CD4 T cells were not enriched in CDR3β P6–7 doublets that promote self-reactivity, relative to CD4 T cells that develop in B6.H-2g7 mice (Fig. 8m). These data, combined with only modest differences in CDR3β P6–7 doublets that promote (P < 10−4) or limit self-reactivity (P < 10−8) between NOD and NOD.H-2b CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 6), argue that T cell development on the NOD MHC enriches the CD4+ T cell repertoire in hydrophobic CDR3β P6–7 doublets that promote self-reactivity.

Discussion

Despite the enormous diversity of self-peptides and MHC alleles12, 10–20% of pre-selection DP thymocytes express TCRs that recognize host self-pMHC complexs27, 28, 29. These findings imply that self-pMHC recognition is not a random happenstance of TCR rearrangement30. Here we elucidate part of the mechanism that endows TCRs with different affinities for self-pMHC ligands. For most TCRβ chains, V(D)J recombination inserts Dβ and N-region additional amino acids within the middle of the CDR3β, including at P6 and P7. A conserved β strand within the TCR V  Ig domain localizes the CDR3β P6–7 doublet at a surface exposed, central location within the TCR’s ligand binding site, ideally positioned to engage peptide and MHC residues. This placement allows the intrinsic biochemical properties of these residues to influence the binding properties of TCRs, with the ultimate specificity being derived from the complete TCRα and TCRβ sequences.

We observed that the frequency at which self-reactive TCRs are created directly correlates with the extent of interfacial hydrophobicity of CDR3β P6–7 doublets. Hydrophobic residues are often found within the center of protein-protein interfaces, forming high affinity focused hotspots of binding that can result from the hydrophobic effect25, 31, 3233. These findings are consistent with our previous computational prediction that cross-reactive and self-reactive TCRs should be enriched in ‘strongly interacting’ amino acids in the CDR3 region21, 22.

Consistent with differential affinity and avidity models of thymic selection4, 5, we observed that TCRs expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in C57BL/6 mice carry reduced frequencies of the least hydrophobic CDR3β P6–7 doublets. As these types of CDR3β P6–7 doublets limit self-reactivity, many DP thymocytes expressing these TCRs likely fail positive selection. Concurrently, peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in C57BL/6 mice are also reduced in the most hydrophobic CDR3β P6–7 doublets in C57BL/6 mice. Several findings argue that that this occurs due to negative selection or diversion into the T  cell lineage; hydrophobic CDR3β P6–7 doublets increase the frequency and strength at which randomly assembled TCRs engage self-pMHC and are enriched in the both the T  cell repertoire and the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell repertoires in Bim−/− mice. Enriched usage of an aliphatic residue versus acidic residue at position 5 of the CDR3β has been noted in Vβ8.2+ T  cells versus CD4+ T in a TCRα chain transgenic system34. However, a re-analysis of a set of MOG-specific CD4+ T cells and T  cells that expand following immunization34 does not reveal biased usage of CDR3β P6–7 doublets, suggesting that the antigen-specificity of a T cell response may dominate over repertoire-wide selection biases.

Structural analyses focused on understanding why TCRs are biased to recognize pMHC ligands have proposed that specific CDR1 and CDR2 residues have been evolutionarily selected for MHC binding14, 15, and that there exists, albeit weak, shape complementarity between the TCR binding site and pMHC35, 36. Our current findings are consistent with observations that specific amino acids, such as tyrosines often present at the tips of CDR1 and CDR2 loops, can promote TCR recognition of pMHC ligands19, 37, 38. As CDR3β P6 and P7 residues are highly variable and can engage the peptide or the MHC, the continuum of self-reactivity that is generated by pairing TCR germline and hyper-variable residues allows thymic selection to create T cell repertoires with the requisite peptide plus host-MHC recognition properties2, 3, 4, 5, 39.

Studies suggest that NOD mice carry increased frequencies of auto-reactive T cells as compared to C57BL/6 mice40, 41. Whether this arises from a loss in tolerance to particular auto-antigens, or reflects repertoire-wide defects in thymic selection is less clear42, 43, 44. Observing that CD4+ T cells in H-2g7 expressing mice are enriched in hydrophobic CDR3β P6–7 doublets, relative to H-2b expressing mice, supports the hypothesis that the unique peptide binding properties of I-Ag7 MHC molecule affects the overall NOD CD4+ T cell repertoire45. Whether CD4+ T cells carrying hydrophobic CDR3β P6–7 doublets are directly linked to type-1 diabetes onset remains unresolved. The prototypical diabetogenic T cell, BDC 2.5, carries the CDR3β P6–7 doublet, GG46. Analysis of a study of twelve NOD β-islet-infiltrating CD4 T cells47, however, suggests that T cells carrying hydrophobic CDR3β P6–7 doublets are more efficient at inducing insulitis and type-1 diabetes, as compared to T cells carrying only small and charged CDR3β P6–7 doublets. Thus, altered T cell repertoire formation as well as auto-antigen display may explain why certain MHC class II alleles provide the most significant genetic risk for developing T1D and several other autoimmune diseases48, 49.

In summary, the interfacial hydrophobicity of CDR3β P6–7 doublets influences the frequency and strength TCR self-reactivity, irrespective of the V  family or CDR3 length. Furthermore, indexing T cell repertoires based on the identity of the CDR3β P6–7 doublets reveals thymic selection biases in normal and type-1 diabetes-prone mouse T cell repertoires.
