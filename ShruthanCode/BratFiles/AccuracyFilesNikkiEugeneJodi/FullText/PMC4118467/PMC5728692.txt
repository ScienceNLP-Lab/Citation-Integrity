Mechanism of tandem duplication formation in  BRCA1  mutant cells
Summary

Small ~10 kb microhomology-mediated tandem duplications (“Group 1 TDs”) are abundant in BRCA1-linked but not BRCA2-linked breast cancer genomes. Here, we define the mechanism underlying this “rearrangement signature”. We show that BRCA1, but not BRCA2, suppresses TDs at a Tus/Ter site-specific chromosomal replication fork barrier in primary mammalian cells. BRCA1 has no equivalent role at chromosomal double strand breaks, indicating specificity for the stalled fork response. Tandem duplications in BRCA1 mutant cells arise by a “replication restart-bypass” mechanism terminated by end joining or by microhomology-mediated template switching, the latter forming complex TD breakpoints. We show that solitary DNA ends form directly at Tus/Ter, implicating misrepair of these lesions in TD formation. We find that BRCA1 inactivation is strongly associated with Group 1 TDs in ovarian cancer. The Group 1 TD phenotype may be a general signature of BRCA1-deficient cancer.

Replication fork stalling at abnormal DNA structure or following collision with transcription complexes is a source of genomic instability in cancer and in developmental disorders1–5. Homologous recombination (HR) at stalled or collapsed forks can either suppress or promote genomic instability6,7. To study repair at stalled mammalian replication forks, we previously adapted the Escherichia coli Tus/Ter replication fork barrier (RFB)8,9 to trigger locus-specific fork stalling and HR on a mammalian chromosome10. We uncovered functions for BRCA1, BRCA2 and Rad51 in suppressing aberrant replicative HR responses at stalled forks. In wild type cells, conservative “short tract” gene conversion (STGC) is the major HR product at Tus/Ter. In cells lacking BRCA1 and Rad51, ~85% of all Tus/Ter-induced HR events resolve by aberrant “long tract” gene conversion (LTGC)10—a replicative response to fork stalling potentially analogous to “break-induced replication” (BIR) in yeast11–13. BRCA1, BRCA2, Rad51 and the Fanconi anemia (FA) genes have additional non-HR functions at stalled forks, where they protect DNA from degradation by the MRE11 nuclease14. BRCA1, together with its heterodimeric partner BARD1, has also been implicated in removal of the CMG replicative helicase from the stalled fork15. BRCA1, BARD1 and the BRCA1-interacting protein CtIP have BRCA2-independent functions in DNA end processing16–18. BRCA1/BARD1 interacts with Rad51 directly and also indirectly via PALB2/BRCA219,20. Thus, BRCA1 performs several functions at the stalled fork and in DSB repair, only some of which are shared with BRCA2.

Recently, a novel “rearrangement signature” specifically associated with BRCA1 loss was identified in the human breast cancer genome—the presence of abundant small (~10 kb) tandem duplications (TDs) with microhomologous breakpoints21,22. This chromotype, which differs from the larger (>100 kb) TDs noted previously in the cancer genome23,24, was termed “rearrangement signature 3″ or “Group 1 TD phenotype (TDP)”22,25. We will use the latter term here. Group 1 TDs are strongly associated with loss of BRCA1 but not with BRCA2 loss, and are enriched at loci that disrupt tumor suppressor genes, suggesting that Group 1 TDs promote tumorigenesis in BRCA1-linked breast cancer21,22. However, the mechanisms that connect BRCA1 loss with TD formation remain undefined. Similarly, it is unclear whether suppression of Group 1 TDs is an intrinsic BRCA1 function that operates in primary cells. In this study, we address these questions by analyzing ~2–6 kb microhomology-mediated TDs that arise at a Tus/Ter site-specific chromosomal RFB in primary mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.

BRCA1 suppresses Tus/Ter-induced TDs

We previously described a ROSA26-targeted 6xTer-HR reporter for simultaneous measurement of STGC and LTGC in mammalian cells, in response to a Tus/Ter-mediated RFB or a chromosomal double strand break (DSB) induced by the rare-cutting I-SceI homing endonuclease10,26. In the reporter shown in Fig. 1a, STGC converts the cell to GFP+RFP–, while LTGC converts it to GFP+RFP+, by replicative duplication of an RFP expression cassette. In response to a Tus/Ter block (following transient Tus expression), we observed extremely low levels of a novel GFP–RFP+ repair product (Fig. 1b). We compared Tus/Ter-induced GFP–RFP+ products in cells expressing wild-type BRCA1 (BRCA1fl/exon11) vs. isogenic cells that express hypomorphic BRCA1 alleles lacking the in-frame exon 11 (BRCA1Δ/exon11). Loss of wtBRCA1 reduced Tus/Ter-induced STGC and increased Tus/Ter-induced LTGC as previously described (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1)10. BRCA1Δ/exon11 cells revealed a ~10-fold increase in Tus/Ter-induced GFP–RFP+ products in comparison to BRCA1fl/exon11 cells. GFP–RFP+ products were further increased by siRNA-mediated depletion of the residual BRCA1exon11 hypomorphic gene product and were not suppressed by Rad51 depletion (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). In parallel, I-SceI induced low levels of GFP–RFP+ products that were only marginally increased by loss of BRCA1 (Extended Data Fig. 1). Thus, BRCA1 suppresses a novel Rad51-independent GFP–RFP+ outcome primarily during the stalled fork response.

To determine the rearrangement underlying the GFP–RFP+ outcome, we analyzed 6xTer-HR reporter structure in Tus/Ter-induced GFP–RFP+ clones (Fig. 2). We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate Tus/Ter-induced GFP–RFP+ clones from BRCA1Δ/exon11 6xTer-HR reporter cells, in parallel with Tus/Ter-induced GFP+RFP– (STGC) and GFP+RFP+ (LTGC) controls, and analyzed genomic (g)DNA by Southern blotting. STGC and LTGC products revealed the expected rearrangements (Fig. 2a and 2b)10,26. In contrast, each GFP–RFP+ rearrangement had a unique structure and fell into one of two classes in BglII-restricted gDNA. Class 1 rearrangements contained a single GFP-hybridizing band of ≤10 kb. Class 2 rearrangements contained one invariant band of ~6.6 kb that co-migrated with the BglII-digested parental reporter and one smaller fragment of variable size (Fig. 2b). PCR amplification and sequencing of the rearrangement breakpoints revealed that all Tus/Ter-induced GFP–RFP+ clones contained microhomology (MH)-mediated or non-homologous tandem duplications of the RFP cassette (hereafter termed “TDs”), with predominant use of 1–2 bp MH at the TD breakpoint (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2). Class 2 rearrangements reflect inclusion of a BglII site within the TD; in other respects the two classes are similar. A detailed analysis of TD breakpoints is presented below.

Specificity of TD suppression by BRCA1

To determine whether TD suppression at Tus/Ter-stalled forks is specific to BRCA1, we studied the contribution of additional stalled fork metabolism/repair proteins to Tus/Ter-induced repair. We compared, in parallel, the impact of siRNA-mediated depletion of candidates on Tus/Ter-induced vs. I-SceI-induced repair in BRCA1fl/exon11 cells vs. BRCA1Δ/exon11 cells, using siRNA against Luciferase as control. In BRCA1fl/exon11 cells (i.e., expressing wtBRCA1), we identified BRCA1, BARD1 and CtIP as major suppressors of Tus/Ter-induced TDs (Extended Data Fig. 3a). CtIP acts largely independently of BRCA1 as a TD suppressor, as it does in certain other repair functions26,27. In contrast, BRCA2, Rad51, FANCA, FANCD2 or SLX4/FANCP suppressed TDs modestly or not at all, despite evidence that these proteins support Tus/Ter-induced HR, as expected from previous studies (Extended Data Fig. 3b) 10,28. I-SceI-induced GFP–RFP+ products were not regulated by the above-noted proteins (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Depletion of the FANCM translocase29 or the Bloom’s syndrome helicase (BLM)30 did not induce TDs in BRCA1fl/exon11 cells but unexpectedly increased Tus/Ter-induced TDs ~15-fold in BRCA1Δ/exon11 cells (Extended Data Figs. 3a and 3c). FANCM and BLM can each disassemble late recombination intermediates but are also implicated in stalled fork metabolism31. Loss of FANCM or BLM affected Tus/Ter-induced TDs quantitatively but not qualitatively (Extended Data Fig 4a; see also TD breakpoint analysis, below). Co-depletion of FANCM and BLM in BRCA1Δ/exon11 cells produced additive effects on TD formation (Extended Data Fig. 4b), suggesting that the two proteins act independently to suppress Tus/Ter-induced TDs.

As a further test of the relative contributions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to TD suppression, we depleted BRCA1, BARD1, BRCA2 or Rad51 in combination with FANCM or BLM in BRCA1fl/exon11 6xTer-HR reporter cells. Consistent with the above findings, co-depletion of BRCA1, BARD1 or CtIP with FANCM or BLM induced Tus/Ter-induced TDs, whereas co-depletion of BRCA2 or Rad51 with FANCM or BLM had minimal impact on TDs (Extended Data Figs. 5a and 5b). We made similar observations in BRCA2 mutant (BRCA2lex1/lex2) ES cells32 (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Thus, even when BRCA2 is biallelically mutated, BRCA1 remains the dominant TD suppressor. The Tus/Ter system recapitulates the specific association of BRCA1 loss with small TDs originally noted in the breast cancer genome21,22. We therefore propose that Group 1 TDs in BRCA1 mutant breast cancer are products of aberrant stalled fork repair.

Mechanism of TD formation

Three different mechanisms could mediate TD formation at stalled forks. The first invokes breakage of both sister chromatids and their fusion by end joining (“breakage-fusion”; Fig. 3a). The “partner” sister chromatid (the sister that does not acquire a TD) would be broken and rearranged during this process. A second model invokes TD initiation by MH-mediated synapsis of a free DNA end generated at the stalled/collapsed rightward fork of Fig. 3b, priming TD formation by “microhomology-mediated break-induced replication” (MMBIR)33,34. A third mechanism entails aberrant “replication restart” of the stalled/collapsed leftward fork of Fig. 3c. By analogy with previously described Rad51-independent replication restart mechanisms35–38, processing of the collapsed leftward fork primes extension of the stalled leading strand by a migrating bubble mechanism resembling BIR13 (Fig. 3c). The approaching conventional rightward fork bypasses the restarted leftward nascent strand and re-copies the TD tract before stalling at Tus/Ter (“replication restart-bypass”; Fig. 3c). By this model, the “upstream” site of the TD breakpoint (defined in Extended Data Fig. 2a) marks the site of displacement of the leftward nascent strand and the “Ter-proximal” site (Extended Data Fig. 2a) is derived from a free DNA end formed at the Tus/Ter-stalled rightward fork. Note that fork breakage pictured in Figs. 3b and 3c is not a requirement of these models, since a free DNA end could alternatively be generated at Tus/Ter by fork regression39. Indeed, high frequency rearrangements observed at a site-specific RFB in Schizosaccharomyces pombe are not accompanied by evidence of fork breakage37.

As summarized in Fig. 3d, the “breakage-fusion”, “MMBIR” and “replication restart-bypass” models predict different fates of the partner sister chromatid during TD formation and/or different dependencies on end joining. To retrieve the partner sister chromatid, we induced mitotic non-disjunction during the cell cycle in which the TD formed, by treating Tus-transfected FANCM-depleted BRCA1Δ/exon11 cells with 30μM cytochalasin B for 24 hours immediately prior to FACS-cloning of GFP–RFP+ cells (Fig. 4a and Materials and Methods). Southern analysis of 60 independent GFP–RFP+ aneuploid clones revealed no off-size GFP-hybridizing bands other than the TD itself in any clone, providing no support for the breakage-fusion model (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figure 1). In contrast, 11/60 GFP–RFP+ clones contained two copies of the 6xTer-HR reporter: one that had undergone a TD and one that retained the parental structure (Fig. 4b). In 8 of these clones, re-cloning failed to separate the two reporter copies, confirming that the TD and unrearranged reporter were present in the same cell (Extended Data Figs. 6a and 6b). We obtained direct TD breakpoint sequence for 6 of these 8 clones. One TD breakpoint was blunt, one entailed insertion of one nucleotide and four revealed MH. The spontaneous non-disjunction rate for this cell line is ~1/1,000. The fact that 8/60 CB-induced “non-disjunction” TD clones revealed an unaltered partner sister chromatid indicates that TDs form at Tus/Ter primarily via a replicative mechanism, not by breakage-fusion. Interestingly, segmental TDs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E. coli are also mediated by replicative mechanisms34,40.

To analyze the role of classical non-homologous end joining (C-NHEJ) in TD formation, we targeted a single copy of the 6xTer-HR reporter to the ROSA26 locus of mouse XRCC4fl/fl ES cells, then generated Cre-treated XRCC4fl/fl and XRCC4Δ/Δ derivatives41. The frequency of Tus/Ter-induced TDs in two XRCC4Δ/Δ clones co-depleted of BRCA1/FANCM or BRCA1/BLM was ~30% of that observed in two XRCC4fl/fl clones (Figs. 4c and 4d). We confirmed that BRCA1 and BARD1 are the dominant TD suppressors in XRCC4fl/fl cells (Extended Data Figs. 6c and 6d). Stable lentivirus-mediated expression of wtXRCC4 restored TD frequencies in XRCC4Δ/Δ clones to wild type levels (Figs. 4e and 4f). The involvement of C-NHEJ in TD formation at Tus/Ter suggests that replication restart-bypass, not MMBIR, is the principal mechanism (Fig 3d). Residual Tus/Ter-induced TDs in XRCC4Δ/Δ cells might entail XRCC4-independent alternative end joining. However, we cannot formally exclude contributions by breakage-fusion or MMBIR to a proportion of Tus/Ter-induced TDs.

TD breakpoint analysis

To better understand the mechanisms underlying TD formation, we analyzed in detail the sequence of Tus/Ter-induced TDs from BRCA1Δ/exon11 cells depleted of FANCM, BRCA1 or BLM. TD spans varied from ~2 kb to ~6 kb, which represent the technical boundaries of TD detection using this reporter (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Tus/Ter-induced TD breakpoints revealed a modest MH bias (Extended Data Fig. 7b). 14/237 (5.9%) breakpoints were homeologous, containing 1–2 bp internal mismatches within longer MH tracts of 4–10 bp, with no consistent strand preference of mismatch correction (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Notably, 6/231 (2.6%) TDs contained complex breakpoints (Extended Data Fig. 7d), suggestive of MH-mediated template switching 42. Template switching is associated with TD formation in E. coli, BIR in S. cerevisiae and alternative end joining in mammalian cells40,43–47. It has been invoked to explain complex breakpoints associated with replication stress in the cancer genome33,48. Our findings provide direct evidence of MH-mediated template switching at stalled mammalian replication forks.

Solitary DNA ends form at Tus/Ter

The “Ter-proximal” site of the TD represents the product of rightward fork stalling at Tus/Ter (Fig. 3c). Indeed, Ter-proximal sites were clustered near the first Ter elements encountered by the rightward fork, a minority being distributed upstream (Extended Data Fig. 7e). In contrast, “upstream” TD sites were more widely distributed (Extended Data Fig. 7f). To determine whether Ter-proximal TD sites correspond to detectable DNA lesions at Tus/Ter, we used high throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS)49,50 to map translocation-competent DNA ends at Tus/Ter. As “bait” for HTGTS, we induced a Cas9/CRISPR-mediated DSB ~30 kb from the 6xTer array at ROSA26 (Fig. 5). (The “translocations” studied here are, strictly, intrachromosomal rearrangements.) Control I-SceI-induced two-ended DSBs should produce equal representation of (+) and (–) DNA ends in HTGTS mapping (Fig. 5a). In contrast, rightward forks arriving at Tus/Ter (Fig. 5b) might generate predominantly (+) DNA ends, while leftward forks (not shown) would generate (–) DNA ends. This polarity is expected whether the DNA end is generated directly by breakage at the branch-point of the stalled fork (Fig. 5b) or indirectly via fork regression (Fig. 5c). Notably, if either sister chromatid were broken anywhere other than at the branch-point of the stalled fork, this would generate a conventional two-ended DSB with equal representation of (+) and (–) DNA ends.

As expected, FANCM-depleted BRCA1Δ/exon11 cells co-transected with control I-SceI and the CRISPR/Cas9 “bait” vectors revealed symmetrical HTGTS distributions of (+) and (–) DNA ends that mapped to the I-SceI site adjacent to the Ter array (Fig. 5d)49. In contrast, translocations into Tus/Ter in FANCM-depleted BRCA1Δ/exon11 cells were highly asymmetric. We noted a ~7-fold excess of (+) ends over (–) ends (Fig. 5d), indicating that solitary DNA ends predominate at Tus/Ter-stalled forks. Tus/Ter HTGTS breakpoints were tightly focused on the Ter array and were MH biased in comparison to I-SceI HTGTS breakpoints, revealing a 1–2 bp MH preference reminiscent of Tus/Ter-induced TD breakpoints (Extended Data Fig. 8a; compare with Extended Data Fig. 7b). Further, translocations at Tus/Ter were more abundant into the Ter sites first encountered by the approaching replication fork (Fig. 5d). In all treatment groups, including cells containing wtBRCA1, the distributions of Tus/Ter HTGTS breakpoints were similar (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 8b). However, a quantitative impact of BRCA1 on the formation of DNA ends at Tus/Ter is not excluded. In all treatment groups, the distribution of Ter-proximal TD sites (products of rightward fork stalling) was significantly shifted in comparison to the distribution of Tus/Ter HTGTS (+) ends (also products of rightward fork stalling; Extended Data Fig. 8b). Taken together, these findings suggest that the Ter-proximal site of the TD breakpoint arises from a solitary DNA end generated at the Tus/Ter RFB, which is further processed before being misrepaired in BRCA1 mutants to form a TD.

TD phenotype in BRCA1 mutant cancer

Our data suggest that “TD suppression” at stalled replication forks is an intrinsic function of BRCA1. If so, the TD phenotype might be a general feature of BRCA1 loss in cancer. To test this idea, we analyzed TDs occurring in 92 cancers from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (URL: http://www.aocstudy.org/), for which whole genome sequence, BRCA1 promoter methylation status and transcriptome data are available. We noted a strong association between loss of BRCA1 by mutation or promoter methylation and Group 1 TDP (Extended Data Fig. 9). Re-analysis of the Sanger Institute dataset22 using our TD algorithm confirmed that TDP Group 1 is strongly associated with BRCA1 loss but not with BRCA2 loss. Indeed, in the Sanger dataset filtered to include only TNBC (which included almost all the Group 1 TDP breast cancers), BRCA2 inactivation was negatively associated with Group 1 TDP (Extended Data Fig. 9b). In the AOCS and Sanger_TNBC datasets, we observed no association between Group 1 TDP and either mutation or aberrant expression of FANCM or BLM (Extended Data Fig. 10). Whether these genes function as TD suppressors in human tumorigenesis therefore remains to be determined.

Conclusion

In work described here, we demonstrate that BRCA1 but not BRCA2 is a major suppressor of TDs at a Tus/Ter RFB in primary mammalian cells. These findings recapitulate the Group 1 TD phenotype of BRCA1 mutant breast cancers21,22,25. We therefore propose that Group 1 TDs in BRCA1-linked cancer arise by defective processing of stalled replication forks. Extending these observations across tumor types, we observed a strong Group 1 TDP in ovarian cancers lacking BRCA1. The Group 1 TDP may therefore serve as a useful biomarker of BRCA1 loss in other cancer types51. Furthermore, our findings suggest that inactivation of BARD1 or RBBP8 (encoding CtIP) may also be associated with Group 1 TDP cancers.

Our analysis suggests that Tus/Ter-induced TDs in BRCA1 mutant cells arise by an aberrant “replication restart-bypass” mechanism terminated by end joining. Certain key elements of this mechanism are conserved in yeast7,13,37,38. However, it remains to be determined precisely how BRCA1 and BARD1, of which there are no yeast orthologs, suppress these aberrant stalled fork responses. BRCA1/BARD1 has BRCA2-independent roles in DNA end processing and in CMG helicase unloading at the stalled fork15–18. Thus, several distinct BRCA1-mediated functions might suppress TD formation at stalled forks. A notable aspect of this study is the finding that solitary DNA ends predominate at Tus/Ter-stalled forks. We detected these lesions in both TD-prone and control cells, suggesting that the production of solitary DNA ends is a generalized, perhaps physiological, response to fork stalling39. The element of TD formation that is specific to BRCA1 loss therefore appears to be the “licensing” of an aberrant replication restart mechanism at stalled forks.

Methods

Molecular biology and siRNAs

The vectors for Ter HR reporters described were constructed by conventional cloning methods using a previously described 6xTer-HR and RFP-SCR reporters10,26. pHIV-NAT-CD52 vectors were derived from pHIV-Zsgreen, a gift from Bryan Welm and Zena Werb (Addgene plasmid # 18121) 52. Ter-containing plasmids were amplified in JJC33 (Tus–) strains of E. coli. siRNA SMARTpools were purchased from Dharmacon. All plasmids used for transfection were prepared by endotoxin-free maxiprep (QIAGEN Sciences, Maryland, MD).

Mouse cell lines and cell culture

Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were authenticated as described in the text and were periodically tested for mycoplasma contamination. Only mycoplasma-free cells were used in experiments described here. Cells were thawed on MEF feeders and maintained in ES medium on gelatinized plates. 10 μg of Ter/HR reporter ROSA26 targeting plasmids per 1 x 107 cells were linearized using Kpn I and introduced by electroporation. ES cells were seeded onto 6-cm dishes containing puromycin-resistant feeders and plates supplemented with 4 μg/ml puromycin 24 hours. Individual colonies were picked 7–10 days later. ROSA26 targeted lines were screened for by PCR. Reporter cassette integration and overall structure was verified for targeted lines by Southern blotting. Multiple BRCA1-deficient or XRCC4-deficient ES clones were generated by transient adenovirus-mediated Cre expression. ROSA26 genotyping primers: ROSA26-sense-(CAT CAA GGA AAC CCT GGA CTA CTG); Ter-HR reporter antisense-(CCT CGG CTA GGT AGG GGA TC). BRCA1 exon11 status was determined by PCR: BRCA1 5′-sense-(CTG GGT AGT TTG TAA GCA TCC); BRCA1 exon11- antisense-(CAA TAA ACT GCT GGT CTC AGG C); BRCA1 exon11-sense-(GGA AAT GGC AAC TTG CCT AG); BRCA1 3′-antisense-(CTG CGA GCA GTC TTC AGA AAG). XRCC4 status was determined by PCR: XRCC4 5′-sense-(TTC AGC TAA CCA GCA TCA ATA G); floxed allele, XRCC4 3′-antisense-(GCA CCT TTG CCT ACT AAG CCA TCT CAC); Exon 3-deleted allele, XRCC4 3′-antisense-(TAA GCT ATT ACT CCT GCA TGG AGC ATT ATC ACC)41. BRCA2 Exons 26 and 27 status was determined by PCR: BRCA2 Intron 25 5′-sense-(TTC AGC TAA CCA GCA TCA ATA G); BRCA2 Exon 27 3′-antisense-(CGT TCT CTC CAC TCC AAG ACT TTG C); BRCA2 PGK promoter 3′-antisense-(TCC ATT TGT CAC GTC CTG CAC GAC G)32. Exon3-deleted, XRCC4-deficient mES cells were transduced with lentivirus expressing a single mRNA encoding nuorseothricin acetyl transferase and human CD52 (the CAMPATH antigen), with or without wild type mouse XRCC4: pHIV-NAT-hCD52-EV (empty vector control) or pHIV-NAT-hCD52-mXRCC4. Stable cultures were selected and maintained in 100 μg/mL nourseothricin (Jenna Bioscience cat#AB-102L).

Recombination assays

1.6 x 105 cells were co-transfected in suspension with 0.35 μg empty vector, pcDNA3β-myc NLS-Tus10, or pcDNA3β-myc NLS-I-SceI53, and 20 pmol ONTargetPlus-smartpool using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). GFP+RFP–, GFP+RFP+ and GFP–RFP+ frequencies were scored 72 hours after transfection by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson 5 Laser LSRII in duplicate. For each duplicate sample, 3–6 x 105 total events were scored. Repair frequencies presented are corrected for background events and for transfection efficiency (50–85%). Transfection efficiency was measured by parallel transfection with 0.05 μg wild type GFP expression vector, 0.30 μg control vector and 20 pmol siRNA. Data presented represents the arithmetic mean and error bars represent the standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) of between five (n=5) and eleven (n=11) independent experiments (n values given in figure legends).

Statistical methods

Figure legends specify the sample number in terms of the number of replicates within each individual experiment (typically two) and the number of independent experiments (n) that were performed to generate the data presented. For repair frequency statistical analysis, the arithmetic mean of samples collected for independent experiments was calculated and data points for each independent experiment were used to calculate the mean and standard error of the mean (s.e.m.), calculated as standard deviation/√n, in which n indicates the number of independent experiments. Differences between sample pairs repair frequencies were analyzed by Student’s two-tailed unpaired t-test, assuming unequal variance using GraphPad Prism v6.0d software. P-values are indicated in each figure legend. Additional statistical analyses are as described in figure legends.

RT-qPCR analysis

RNA from transfected cells was extracted using QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN Sciences, Maryland, MD) 48 hours after transfection. First-strand cDNA analysis was performed on an ABI 7300 Real time PCR System using Power SYBR Green RNA-to C TM 1-Step Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). SYBR green RT-qPCR assays of GAPDH and siRNA-targeted gene was performed. We used the NIH NCBI Nucleotide utility to generate gene-specific primer sequences for mouse BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, BARD1, CTIP, SLX4, FANCA, FANCD2, and GAPDH. Primers for RT-PCR: BRCA1-sense-(ATG AGC TGG AGA GGA TGC TG); BRCA1-antisense-(CTG GGC AGT TGC TGT CTT CT); BRCA2-sense-( TCT GCC ACT GTG AAA AAT GC); BRCA2-antisense-(TCA AGC TGG GCT GAA GAT T; SLX4-sense-(GTG GGA CGA CTG GAA TGA GG); SLX4-antisense-(GCA CCT TTT GGT GTC TCT GG); CTIP-sense-(AGG AGA AGG AGG GGA CGC); CTIP-antisense-(TGA AAT ACC TCG GCG GGT G); FANCA-sense- (GGC AGC CCT GTA CAA CTG AT); FANCA-antisense- (GCC AGC AGC TCT GTC ATG TT); FANCD2-sense- (CAG ATT CGC AGC AGG TTC AC); FANCD2-antisense- (ACA CAC ATG CAG AAC AGG AT); GAPDH-sense-(CGT CCC GTA GAC AAA ATG GT); GAPDH-antisense-(TCG TTG ATG GCA ACA ATC TC). We used the Roche ProbeFinder utility based on Primer 3 software (Whitehead Institute, MIT) to generate gene-specific primer sequences for mouse FANCM and BLM: FANCM-sense-(GTC GTT ATC CTC GCT GAA GG); FANCM-antisense-(TTT GTT GGA CTG ACT CTG ATT ATA TGT); BLM-sense-(CGC GAC GTA AGC CTG AGT); BLM-antisense-(TGG CTG AGT GTC GCT GTA GT). mRNA was measured in triplicates. Target gene expression level was normalized to GAPDH and expressed as a fold difference from siLUCIFERASE treated sample from the same experiment (x=−2ΔΔCt, with ΔΔCt= [Ct  -Ct ]-[Ct LUCIFERASE-Ct GAPDH]). Error-bars represent the standard deviation of the ΔCt value (SDEV = √[SDEVTARGET2 + SDEVGAPDH2]).

Western blotting

Cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% NP-40 containing the protease inhibitors, PMSF, and Roche complete protease inhibitor tablet) and resolved by 10 % bis-Tris SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). Protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting using the following antibodies; beta-tubulin (Abcam ab6046, 1:4,000), hRad51 (aliquot B32, 1:500), mXRCC4 (Abcam ab97351, 1:3,000).

Southern Blotting

Southern blotting of BglII or AseI digested genomic DNA was performed using a GFP cDNA probe by methods described previously10,26,53. For all experiments, mouse ES cell clones harboring a single, intact copy of the reporter integrated at the ROSA26 locus on chromosome 6 were used. Genomic DNA was extracted from ES cells grown to confluence on gelatinized 6-well plates (~5–10 x 106 cells) using a Puregene DNA Isolation Kit (QIAGEN Sciences, Maryland, MD).

Individual Repair Clone Capture and Molecular Analysis

Individual GFP+ RFP–, GFP+RFP+, or GFP–RFP+ cells were FACS captured 72 hrs post transfection using a FACSAria II SORP running FACSDiva software v6.1.3. To capture aneuploid “non-disjunction” clones, individual GFP+RFP+, or GFP–RFP+ cells were FACS sorted 48 hrs post transfection. Cytochalasin B induced mitotic arrest and nondisjunction, 24 hours post transfection cells were incubated for 22hrs and FACS sorted for 2hr in 30 μM dihydrocytochalasin B (Sigma Aldrich D1641). Isolated colonies from single cells were picked from 6 cm dishes containing feeder MEFs and individual repair clones expanded onto 24-well plates also containing feeder MEFs. Genomic DNA was extracted from ES clones subsequently expanded and grown to confluence on gelatinized 6-well plates (~5–10 x 106 cells) using a Puregene DNA Isolation Kit (QIAGEN Sciences, Maryland, MD). LTGC and TD breakpoint junction PCR was performed using Taq DNA Polymerase (QIAGEN Sciences, Maryland, MD) according to manufacturer’s instructions using primers unique to HR cassette synthetic RFP exons: RFP-exonA-sense-(ATG TAC GGC TCC AAG GCC TAC GTG AAG CAC); RFP-exonB-antisense-(TCG TAC TGT TCC ACG ATG GTG TAG TCC TCG). Unpurified PCR product sequencing was performed by Eton Bioscience (Cambridge, MA) using nested primers: sense-(TGC ACG CTT CAA AAG CGC ACG); antisense-(CAA GTT AAC AAC AAC AAT TGC ATT C). TD breakpoint sequence analysis and alignment was performed manually. Exact duplicate clones of individual TDs from within one experiment were removed prior to subsequent analysis. No exact duplicates of individual TDs were identified between different experiments.

LAM-HTGTS Sample Preparation and Analysis

24x 1.6 x 105 cells mouse ES reporter cells containing a single copy of the 1xGFP Ter/HR reporter cassette targeted to the ROSA26 locus were co-transfected in suspension with 0.35 μg empty vector, pcDNA3β-myc NLS-Tus, or pcDNA3β-myc NLS-I-SceI, 10 pmol ONTargetPlus-smartpool and 0.15 μg pX330 CRISPR/Cas9 expression plasmid targeting bait sequence ~30 kb distant to the ROSA26 locus.

HTGTS breakpoints in FANCM-depleted BRCA1Δ/exon11 cells harboring a single ROSA26-targeted 6xTer-I-SceI-GFP cassette. Grey area/orange triangles: 6xTer-array. I-SceI-induced DSBs produce expected symmetrical pattern in HTGTS. Tus/Ter-induces asymmetrical pattern with (+) ends ≫ (–) ends, indicating presence of solitary DNA ends. Note virtual absence of signal in EV controls. Maps represent pooled data from two (I-SceI), three (Tus), or two (EV) independent replicates.   Tus/Ter-induced HTGTS in BRCA1fl/exon11 or BRCA1Δ/exon11 cells receiving siRNAs shown. For all BRCA1Δ/exon11 groups and for BRCA1fl/exon11 cells depleted of FANCM, data pooled from three independent replicates. All other BRCA1fl/exon11 groups, data pooled from two independent replicates.
