TREM-1 associated macrophage polarization plays a significant role in inducing insulin resistance in obese population

Abstract

Background

TREM-1 acts as an amplifier of inflammation expressed on macrophages. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between TREM-1 and macrophage polarization, and association of TREM-1 and M1 macrophage polarization with insulin resistance (IR) in obese population compared to non-obese population.

Methods

We enrolled 38 patients after obtaining IRB approval for this study. We evaluated the mRNA and protein expression levels of general macrophage marker (CD68), M1 marker (CD86, CCR7, iNOS, IFNγ, TNF-α and IL-6,), M2 marker (CD206, CD163, IL-10, IL-4) and chemokine axis (MCP-1, CCR2 and CCR5) along with TREM-1 and TREM-2 in omentum fat, subcutaneous fat, and liver biopsy tissues of non-obese (N = 5), obese non-diabetics, (N = 16) and obese diabetics (N = 17).

Results

The results of our study showed over-expression of TREM-1, M1 markers and down-regulation of TREM-2 and M2 markers in the omentum, subcutaneous and liver biopsies of obese patients (diabetics and non-diabetics) compared to non-obese patients. Overall, the obese diabetic group showed a significant (p < 0.05) higher number of patients with over expression of M1 markers (TREM-1, CD68, CD86, CCR-7, iNOS, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, CCR-2 and CCR-5) and down-regulation of M2 markers (CD206, CD163 and IL-4) in liver biopsy compared to obese non-diabetics.

Conclusions

TREM-1 expression is significantly increased along with the M1 markers in liver biopsy of obese diabetic (17/17) and obese non-diabetic patients (9/16). Our data suggests that TREM-1 overexpression and M1 macrophage polarization are associated with obesity-induced IR.

Background

Chronic inflammation in obesity and diabetes is mediated by inflammatory cells including macrophages, B cells, T cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and mast cells [1]. Increased systemic inflammation in obesity is marked by elevations in circulating inflammatory cytokines and in adipose tissue by accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) [2, 3]. Macrophages, the most predominant inflammatory cells in adipose tissue, play an important role in obesity-related inflammation [4]. The phenotypic change to classically activated (M1) macrophages in obesity [5] has been associated with chronic inflammatory response, which is crucial for obesity-induced insulin resistance [6].

The M1 macrophages express high levels of main histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II), CD68 marker, CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules [7, 8]. The M1 phenotype macrophages are induced by interferon (IFN)-γ and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This leads to increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), upregulation of macrophage MHC class II and CC (CC motif) chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) expression [9]. IFN-γ, along with polarization of M1 macrophages, also promotes M1 cell expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, IL1β, IL12, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) [10], leading to insulin resistance [11]. The C–C chemokine receptor types 2 and 5 (CCR2 and CCR5), and their respective ligands, C–C chemokine ligand types 2 (CCL2/MCP-1) and 5 (CCL5/RANTES) play an important role in polarizing monocytes to M1 macrophages [12]. Continuous migration of monocytes to adipose tissue is regulated by CCL2-CCR2 interaction [13] and CCR5/CCL5 axis [14].

In contrast to M1, M2 macrophages may play an important role in down-regulation of inflammation by releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. These M2 macrophages are predominantly activated by Th2 cytokines, mainly interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 [9]. In non-obese subjects, adipocytes release higher levels of adiponectin that improves insulin sensitivity and enhances M2 macrophage polarization [15]. The density of M2 macrophages is lower compared to M1 macrophages in obese patients [16] as a result of imbalance in CCR2/CCL2 and CCR5 axis. The imbalance in obese patients due to pro-inflammatory cytokines influences the M1/M2 polarization. To evaluate the M2 expression as anti-inflammatory markers, we used the gene expression of CD163 (scavenger receptor), CD206 (Mannose receptor), and interleukin 10 (IL-10) [17].

Triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1, a cell surface receptor, is a member of immunoglobulin family. It is expressed mostly on myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils) and recognized as a potent amplifier of acute and chronic inflammation [18]. TREM-1 plays a crucial role in macrophage polarization and induces the M1 macrophages [19]. The association of TREM-1 with a trans-membrane adaptor protein DNAX activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) leads to TREM-1 activation [20]. TREM-1 activation leads to the downstream signalling through protein kinases that results in the secretion of M1 pro-inflammatory cytokines [19]. The amplification of chronic inflammation through TREM-1 and M1 cytokines plays a role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance [21]. Similar to TREM-1, TREM-2 is expressed on monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells. However, TREM-2 acts as an anti-inflammatory agent via enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine transcription and production and regulates the excessive inflammation [22]. In our previous study, we found increased expression of TREM-1 in patients with obesity and diabetes [23]. In this study, we hypothesize that enhanced TREM-1 expression mediated the change in the phenotype of ATMs with the predominance of classically activated pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) in obese diabetics’ results in insulin resistance.

Methods

Patient selection

This prospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Creighton University. After informed consent was obtained, we enrolled 38 patients who underwent surgery at Creighton University Medical Center and Immanuel Medical Center. Following the explanation of the study in layman language, the participation was voluntary, and if elected to participate, IRB-approved informed consent together with the HIPPA forms was signed by the participants in the study. Of 38 patients, 17 were morbidly obese diabetics, 16 were morbidly obese non-diabetics, and 5 were non-obese non-diabetic patients undergoing elective non-weight loss surgery (ex-hernia, fundoplication) and elective gall bladder surgery. Inclusion criteria: Morbidly obese (BMI > 35 and BMI < 65) patients with age >21 years and <65 years undergoing bariatric surgery were included in this study. Exclusion criteria: Patients having systemic inflammatory conditions including SLE, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis and malignant conditions were not included in this study. Patients who were on immunosuppressant medications were also excluded from the study. Patients on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) were advised to discontinue the medication at least 1-week before the surgery or switched to another pain medication.

Tissue collection

Liver, omentum and subcutaneous fat tissue biopsies were obtained during bariatric surgery.

Clinical data

The clinical data was collected from the chart review. Different variables of interest for the study were patient’s demographics (BMI, weight, height, sex and race) and co-morbid conditions (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, sleep apnea, smoking and inflammatory disorders).

RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and real-time PCR

Table 1 Primers used in this study for real time PCR. TRI reagent (Trizol reagent, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was used to isolate the total RNA from tissues as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA quantification was done by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and cDNA was synthesized using Improm II reverse transcription kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR was performed in triplicate using SYBR Green Master Mix and a Real-time PCR system (CFX96, BioRad Laboratories, and Hercules, CA, USA). The primers for target genes (Table 1) were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA). The PCR cycling conditions were 5 min at 95 °C for initial denaturation, 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55–60 °C (as per the primer annealing temperatures) and 30 s at 72 °C followed by melting curve analysis. GAPDH was used to normalize differences in RNA isolation, RNA degradation, and the efficiencies of the reverse transcription. Fold expression of mRNA transcripts relative to controls was determined after normalizing to GAPDH. The relative expressions of target genes were stated as fold ratio using 2−ΔΔCT method. 

The target genes expression fold changes in obese diabetics and obese non-diabetics were calculated by comparison to non-obese subjects whose fold expression was stated as 1. The target gene expression was regarded as over expression if there is increase in fold changes; likewise, down regulation if there is decrease in fold changes.

Preparation and staining of specimen

Fixation of the tissue specimens was done with 4% formalin. Tissue was transversely sectioned at 2 mm and embedded in paraffin. This was followed by thin tissue sectioning (5 μm) using a microtome and thin sections were placed on a glass slide. Deparaffinization, rehydration and antigen retrieval were done prior to immunostaining.

Immunofluorescence (IF) study

Immunofluorescence staining was done as per standard protocol. Mouse (sc-393951) or goat (sc-7082) anti-CD68, goat anti-TREM-1 (sc-19309), rabbit anti-TREM-2 (sc-48764), rabbit anti-CD86 (ab53004), rabbit anti-CD206 (ab125028), rabbit anti-CD163 (ab174867) rabbit anti-CCR7 (ab32527), rabbit anti-iNOS (ab3523), rabbit anti-CCR2 (ab155321), goat anti-CCR5 (ab1673), rabbit anti-MCP-1 (ab9669), rabbit anti-TNF-α (sc-1348), rabbit anti- IL-6 (sc-1265), mouse anti-IFN-γ (sc-8423), Goat anti-IL-4 (sc-1260) and mouse anti-IL-10 (sc-8438) antibodies were used as primary antibody. Santa Cruz Biotech antibodies were used at 1:50 dilution and Abcam antibodies were used at 1:200 dilutions for primary antibodies. Alexa Fluor 594 (red) and Alexa Fluor 488 (green) conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 1:200 dilution were used. The slides were counterstained with DAPI (4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to stain nuclei. Immunofluorescence microscopy at 20× was done with an Olympus inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX51). Negative controls were run by using isotypes for each fluorochrome. Fluorescence intensity was measured in the stained slides using Image-J software and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was calculated.

CD14+ cells isolation and immunofluorescence staining

Biopsy samples were collected and finely chopped with collagenase I (5 mg/ml) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After enzymatic digestion, samples were suspended in MACS buffer (400 μl) and total number of cells were counted using Countess Automated Cell Counter. Cells were incubated with CD14 microbeads (20 μl) (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA) per 107 total cells in MACS Buffer (80 μl) for 15 min at 4 °C. The cells were processed for positive selection using the Posseld2 program on the AutoMACS Pro Separator (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). The CD14+ fraction was collected and then further processed for immunofluorescence staining for TREM-1, TREM-2, CD86, CCR7, CD206, CD163, CCR2, CCR5, IL4 and IL10 as described above. The sample size of biopsy samples for CD14+ cells isolation from non-obese subjects is limited in this study.

Statistical analysis

Demographics, co-morbidities and biochemical profile were compared between obese diabetic and non-diabetic subjects using student t test for continuous variables and Chi square (χ2) and Pearson’s correlation analysis for categorical variables. The mRNA and protein expression of TREM-1, TREM-2, pan macrophage marker (CD68), M1 macrophage marker (CD86, iNOS, CCR7, TNF-α and IL-6,), M2 macrophage marker (CD206 and CD163), cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-10) and chemokines axis (MCP-1, CCR2 and CCR5) in the biopsy tissues were compared between non-obese, obese non-diabetics and obese diabetics subjects using One-way ANOVA for continuous variables. Among the categorical variables of the subjects, the overexpression of TREM-1, CD68, CD86, CCR-7, iNOS, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, CCR-2 and CCR-5 and down regulation of TREM-2, CD163, CD206, IL-4 and IL-10 in biopsy tissues were analyzed between obese non-diabetics and obese diabetics using Chi square (χ2) and Pearson’s correlation analysis. Subject’s categorical variables with correlation between TREM-1 with M1 and M2 macrophage markers were also analyzed among obese non-diabetics and obese diabetics using Chi square (χ2) and Pearson’s correlation analysis. Data are presented as mean ± SD or number (percentage) of patients. All the data were analyzed by SPSS v21 and Graph Pad Prism. A value of p < 0.05 (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001) was considered statistically significant.

Table 2 Demographics and co-morbid conditions of study population. The patient demographics and co-morbid conditions are shown in Table 2. 

Demographics and co-morbidities were compared between obese non-diabetics and obese diabetics using student t test for continuous variables and Chi square (χ2) and Pearson’s correlation analysis for categorical variables. There was no significant difference noted between the groups in patient’s demographics. Data in demographics show mean values ± SD of patients. The tissue biopsies of non-obese subjects from our previous work [23] was used for this study due to limited number of control patient population. Data in co-morbid condition show number of subjects (%). Among the co-morbid conditions, hypertension is significantly higher in obese diabetic patients *p < 0.05.

Over-expression of TREM-1 and M1 markers mRNA transcripts in the tissues of obese diabetic subjects

The mRNA expression levels (fold-change) of pan macrophage marker (CD68), M1 macrophage markers (TREM-1, CD86, CCR-7, iNOS, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, CCR-2 and CCR-5) and M2 macrophage markers (TREM-2, CD163, CD206, IL-4 and IL-10) in the biopsy tissues are shown in Fig. 1. 

The obese diabetic group showed a significant (p < 0.05) over-expression of M1 macrophage markers in omentum (Fig. 1Aa), subcutaneous (not significant in IL-6 and MCP-1) (Fig. 1Ba) and liver (Fig. 1Ca) biopsy tissues compared to non-obese subjects. In M1 macrophages TREM-1, iNOS and CCR-5 mRNA expression were significantly (p < 0.05) over-expressed in omentum, subcutaneous and liver tissue biopsies of obese diabetic subjects compared to the obese non-diabetics. Obese diabetic subjects also had significant (p < 0.05) over-expression of CD68, CD86, CCR-7, MCP-1 and CCR-2levels in omentum and liver biopsies (no difference in subcutaneous) compared to the obese non-diabetics. Over-expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-6, was found only in liver (not in omentum and subcutaneous) tissue biopsies of obese diabetics compared to obese non-diabetics. We also found obese non-diabetics had significant (p < 0.05) over-expression of CD68, TREM-1, CD86, CCR-7, iNOS, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, CCR-2 and CCR-5 mRNA expression levels only in omentum (not in liver and subcutaneous) compared to non-obese subjects.

The obese diabetic group showed a significant (p < 0.05) down-regulation of M2 macrophage markers in omentum (Fig. 1Ab), subcutaneous (Fig. 1Bb) and liver (Except IL-10, p > 0.05) (Fig. 1Cb) biopsy tissues compared to non-obese subjects. In M2 markers CD163, CD206 and IL-10 mRNA expression were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in omentum, and liver (not in subcutaneous) biopsies of obese diabetic subjects compared to the obese non-diabetics. The obese diabetic group had significant (p < 0.05) down-regulation of CD206 only in liver (not in omentum and subcutaneous) and down-regulation of TREM-2 only in omentum (not in liver and subcutaneous) tissue biopsies compared to obese non-diabetics. At the same time, obese non-diabetics had significant (p < 0.05) down-regulation of CD163 mRNA expression levels only in omentum (not in liver and subcutaneous) compared to non-obese subjects.

High immunoreactivity of TREM-1 and M1 macrophage markers in the tissue biopsies of obese diabetic subjects

The dual immunofluorescence study showed a significant positive association of CD68 over-expression with TREM-1, CD86, CCR7, iNOS and IFN-γ in the omentum (Fig. 2A), subcutaneous (Fig. 2B) and liver (Fig. 2C) biopsies of obese subjects compared to non-obese subjects. We also found a significant positive association of CD68 over-expression with TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, CCR2 and CCR5 in the omentum (Fig. 3A), subcutaneous (Fig. 3B) and liver (Fig. 3C) biopsies of obese subjects compared to non-obese subjects. Figure 4 depicts that the CD68 over-expression was inversely associated with the down-regulation of TREM-2, CD206, CD163, IL-4 and IL-10 in the omentum (Fig. 4A), subcutaneous (Fig. 4B) and liver (Fig. 4C) biopsies of obese subjects compared to non-obese subjects.   

The MFI levels of M1 markers were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in omentum (Fig. 5A), subcutaneous (Fig. 5B) and liver (Fig. 5C) biopsies of obese diabetic compared to non-obese subjects. In M1 markers TREM-1, iNOS and CCR-5 MFI levels were also significantly (p < 0.05) higher in omentum, subcutaneous and liver tissues of obese diabetic compared to obese non-diabetic subjects. Obese diabetic subjects also had significant (p < 0.05) over-expression of CD68, CD86, CCR-7, TNF-α, MCP-1, and CCR-2 levels in omentum and liver biopsies (no difference in subcutaneous) compared to the obese non-diabetics. We found that obese diabetics had significantly increased IFN-γ and IL-6 MFI levels only in liver biopsies (not in omentum and subcutaneous) compared to obese non-diabetics. We also found increased MFI levels of CD68, TREM-1, CD86, iNOS, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, CCR-2 and CCR-5 only in omentum (not in liver and subcutaneous) biopsies of obese non-diabetics compared to non-obese subjects. 

The MFI levels of M2 markers were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in omentum (Fig. 5A), subcutaneous (Fig. 5B) and liver (Fig. 5C) tissues of Obese diabetics compared to non-obese subjects. The TREM-2 and CD206 MFI levels were significantly (p < 0.05) down regulated in the tissue biopsies between obese diabetic and obese non-diabetics. Obese diabetic subjects also had significant (p < 0.05) down-regulation of CD163, IL-4 and IL-10 MFI levels in omentum and liver tissue biopsies (no difference in subcutaneous) compared to the obese non-diabetics. We found that obese non-diabetics had significant (p < 0.05) down-regulation of CD163 in omentum and subcutaneous but not in liver biopsies compared to non-obese subjects. At the same time, IL-10 was significantly down regulated in omental tissue (not in liver and subcutaneous tissues) of obese non-diabetics compared to non-obese subjects.

We also found significantly increased immune reactivity of for TREM-1, CD86, CCR7, IFNγ, CCR2 and CCR5 and decreased immune reactivity of TREM-2, CD163, CD206 and IL-4 in the isolated CD14+ positive cells from omentum, subcutaneous and liver biopsy samples of obese diabetics compared to obese non-diabetics (Fig. 6). 

Higher number of patients with over expression of TREM1 and M1 macrophage markers in liver samples of obese diabetics

Table 3 Expression of M1 and M2 makers in omentum and liver biopsy samples. A higher number of patients with increased TREM-1 and M1 macrophage markers were found in both obese diabetics and obese non-diabetics compared to non-obese patients. Overall, the obese diabetic group showed a significantly (p < 0.05) higher number of patients with over expression of M1 markers (CD68, TREM-1, CD86, CCR7, iNOS, IFN-γ, TNF-α, MCP-1, CCR-2 and CCR-5) and down-regulation of M2 markers (CD2016,CD163 and IL-4) in liver biopsy tissues compared to obese non-diabetics (Table 3). We also found that the obese diabetic group showed a significantly (p < 0.05) higher number of patients with overexpression of some M1 markers (CCR7, iNOS and IFN-γ) and down-regulation of some M2 markers (CD206, IL-4 and IL-10) in omentum tissues compared to the obese non-diabetics (Table 3). At the same time, the obese diabetic group had a higher number of patients with over expression of M1 markers and down-regulation of M2 markers in subcutaneous tissues compared to obese non-diabetics, but not statistically significant. 

Expression of M1 and M2 makers in omentum and liver biopsy samples of obese subjects compared to non-obese subjects.Higher number of subjects with overexpression of TREM-1, CD68, CD86, CCR-7, iNOS, IFN-γ, MCP-1, CCR-2 and CCR-5 and down regulation of TREM-2, CD163, CD206, IL-4 and IL-10 were analyzed between obese non-diabetics and obese diabetics using Chi square (χ2) and Pearson’s correlation analysis for categorical variables. Data show number of subjects having higher values of these compared to control non-obese subjects. Values show number of subjects (% subjects of total), not significant (NS). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.

Strong correlation between TREM-1 and M1 macrophage markers in liver samples of obese diabetics

Table 4 Correlation between TREM-1 with M1 and M2 macrophage markers in omentum and liver tissues. On correlation analysis, a significantly (p < 0.05) high association was found between increased TREM-1 and M1 macrophage markers (CD68, CD86, CCR-7, iNOS, IFN-γ, MCP-1, CCR-2 and CCR-5) in liver biopsies of obese diabetics compared to obese non-diabetics. Similarly, in liver biopsy, we found a significantly (p < 0.05) negative association between increased TREM-1 and M2 macrophage markers (CD206, CD163 and IL-4) and obese diabetic populations (Table 4). At the same time, we observed a significant (p < 0.05) positive association of increased omentum TREM-1 with IFN-γ; negative association of increased omentum TREM-1 with IL-4 and IL-10 in obese diabetic group compared to obese non-diabetics (Table 4). There was no significant association between increased subcutaneous TREM-1 and other target genes, when compared between obese diabetics and obese non-diabetics (data not shown).

Data show number of subjects having higher values of these compared to control non-obese subjects. Values show number of subjects (% subjects of total), not significant (NS).*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

Discussion

Our study results showed that obese diabetic patients had increased polarization of tissue M1 macrophages. Tissue M1 macrophages are associated with high incidence of local and systemic inflammation, which is associated with insulin resistance in morbidly obese patients. The relationship between TREM-1 and M1 macrophage polarization has not been well-investigated and not clearly understood. Our study showed that patients with obesity and diabetes have TREM-1 overexpression along with higher M1 macrophage polarization. These results do highlight the importance of association between TREM-1 and M1 macrophage polarization.

Macrophages are one of key mediators of inflammation in obesity. Increased M1 macrophages along with pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines contribute to the chronic low-grade inflammation [24]. Chronic inflammation plays an important role in obesity and development of T2DM [19]. TREM-1 is a potent amplifier of acute and chronic inflammation [25]. We found increased expression of pan macrophage marker CD68 and TREM-1 expression in the omentum fat, subcutaneous fat and liver of the obese subjects compared to non-obese subjects. These results indicate that an overall obese patient has higher TREM-1 overexpression and tissue macrophage proliferation. Our study also showed that obese diabetics had significantly higher incidence of TREM-1 overexpression compared to the obese non-diabetics along with M1 macrophage expression. Our results show that obesity-induced M1 macrophage expression and TREM-1 overexpression plays a significant role in development of Type II DM.

Macrophage polarization and the phenotype alteration are regulated by various cytokines and chemokines. IFN-γ secreted from Th1 cells promotes the M1 polarization, whereas IL-4 and IL-10 secreted from Th2 cells promotes the M2 polarization [26]. Obese diabetics showed significantly increased expression of IFN-γ that was highly associated with TREM-1 over-expression in omentum and liver biopsy samples compared to obese non-diabetics. The results of our study suggest the possible regulatory role of TREM-1 on the secretion of IFN-γ, thereby possibly affecting macrophage polarization and obesity-induced insulin resistance [19, 27–29]. The expression of IL-4 in omentum and liver tissues was significantly decreased in obese diabetics compared to obese non-diabetics. We observed that obese diabetics and non-diabetics had a lower number of patients with down regulation of IL-10 in liver biopsy samples. Since IL-10 expression levels are inversely related to IR, potentiating IL-10 may enhance Th2 response, further curbing the inflammation and IR and development of T2DM [30]. The inverse association between increased IL-4 levels (omentum and liver) and IL-10 levels (omentum) with TREM-1 over-expression supports our hypothesis that TREM1 also plays an important role in suppressing anti-inflammatory mediators.

Obesity associated insulin resistance is mediated by the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) and chemo attractants (MCP-1). These inflammatory mediators increase the chemotaxis of inflammatory cells into adipose tissues [31]. Among these inflammatory mediators, TNF-α primarily secreted from myeloid cells mediates the release of other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6 [32]. In our study, obese diabetics had a higher number of patients with significantly increased expression of TNF-α in liver biopsy samples compared to obese non-diabetics; this was positively associated with TREM-1 over-expression. The tissue level overexpression of TREM1 and TNF-α might indicate the possible regulatory role of TREM-1 on TNF-α expression. TNF-α overexpression also reported to play a pathogenic role in obesity and particularly in insulin resistance and type II DM [33]. Among the other cytokines, increased expression of IL-6 positively correlates with obesity and decreased expression with weight loss [2]. However data regarding the role of IL-6 in obesity mediated inflammation and insulin resistance remains controversial [34]. Our study results also showed that obese diabetics had higher number of patients with significantly increased expression of IL-6. This seems to show a trend of positive correlation with the TREM-1 over-expression in biopsy tissues, but not statistically significant. These results indicate that the over-expression of TREM-1 may lead to increased levels of TNF-α and possibly IL-6 which ultimately result in chronic tissue level inflammation and insulin resistance [2].

Chemokines and chemokine receptors mediate recruitment of the macrophages during obesity-induced chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. CCR2/MCP-1 and CCR5 play an important role in the development of insulin resistance by interactions among adipose tissue, the liver and macrophages [35]. In our study, increased expression of MCP-1, CCR-2 and CCR5 were found in the omentum, subcutaneous and liver of obese subjects compared to non-obese subjects. Obese diabetics also had a higher number of patients with significantly increased expression of MCP-1, CCR-2, and CCR5 that was positively associated with TREM-1 over-expression in liver biopsy tissues. Increased expression and association of TREM-1 with these chemokines in liver tissue suggests that the possible role of TREM-1 in association with chemokines and chemokine receptors to regulate the macrophage proliferation [36]. Macrophage proliferation in liver in obese patients especially in diabetics suggests their role in inducing the obesity-induced IR.

Obesity-induced chronic inflammation switches the macrophage phenotype from M2 to M1. TREM-1 over-expression along with M1 macrophage markers (CD86, CCR7 and iNOS) expression was found in the omentum biopsies of both obese diabetics and non-diabetics, supporting the hypothesis that chronic inflammation and macrophage phenotype change happens early in obese patients with or without diabetes [37]. Increased over-expression of CCR7 [38] and iNOS [39] in the obese diabetic group in a higher number of patients in omentum tissues compared to obese non-diabetics, suggests that the predominance of M1 macrophage markers in ATMs regulates the amplitude of adipose tissue inflammation. However, we found significantly increased overexpression of all three M1 macrophage markers (CD86, CCR7, and iNOS) in obese diabetic group in a higher number of patients in liver tissues compared to obese non-diabetics. The strong positive correlation between these M1 macrophage markers with TREM-1 also suggests that TREM-1 may play a significant role in M1 polarization and M1 macrophage phenotype expression [40]. These results indicate that the phenotype change of the macrophages in the liver were associated with TREM1 overexpression in obese patients plays a key role in the development of IR compared to visceral fat.

Adipocyte-mediated inflammatory response in obesity increases the monocytes recruitment and activation from the circulation. It also facilitates M1 macrophage accumulation instead of converting monocytes to M2 macrophages [41]. The M2 macrophages are associated with immunosuppression and resolution of the inflammation [15]. Our study showed that the expression of M2 macrophage [42] markers (CD206 and CD163) and TREM-2 [43] were down-regulated in omentum, subcutaneous and liver biopsy samples of the obese subjects. The obese diabetic population had significantly decreased expression of M2 markers in the liver (CD206 and CD163) and omentum (CD206) compared to obese non-diabetics. Similarly, obese non-diabetics had a lower number of patients with down regulation of M2 markers (CD206 and CD163) in liver biopsy samples compared to non-obese subjects. The expression of TREM-2 and M2 markers in rest of the obese subjects indicates the compensatory mechanism to counter the ongoing inflammation, thereby controlling the insulin sensitivity and IR [44]. Our study results showed a negative association between increased TREM-1 and M2 markers (CD206 and CD163) in the liver biopsy tissues of the obese diabetic group. These results further support our hypothesis that increased TREM-1 expression in association with increased M1 macrophage regulates the pathogenesis of IR via suppression of the M2 phenotype.

Our study showed significant increases in the TREM-1, CD68, CD86, CCR-7, iNOS, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, CCR-2 and CCR-5 and decreases in TREM-2, CD206, CD163, IL-4 and IL-10 in omentum fat samples of both obese diabetic and non-diabetic subjects, but not in subcutaneous fat. These results suggest that visceral fat possibly plays an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced IR compared to peripheral fat. This may be due to its anatomical location and access to the portal circulation [45]. In this study, we found a significant increase in TREM-1 expression along with M1 markers in liver biopsy tissues of obese diabetic (17/17) and obese non-diabetic patients (9/16). In the obese non-diabetic group, these 9 patients were not clinically diabetic, but they did have features of pre-diabetes. TheTREM-1 over-expression in liver biopsies of the pre-diabetics (obese non-diabetic, 9/16) indicates that TREM-1 can potentiate the macrophage infiltration and M1 polarization in pre-diabetics and might predispose to the development of T2DM and IR.

Conclusions

Overall, obese patients had a higher incidence of TREM-1 over-expression and M1 macrophage proliferation. TREM-1 overexpression is associated with increased M1 macrophage markers and Th1 cytokines, and inversely related to M2 macrophage and Th2 cytokines. Our data also suggests that TREM-1 overexpression may predispose the pre-diabetics to obesity-induced IR via macrophage polarization. Thus, our study suggests that targeting TREM-1 could be a promising therapeutic strategy in preventing the development of obesity-induced insulin resistance.

mRNA expression studies of M1 and M2 macrophage markers using qPCR in the biopsy samples of study subjects. The RNA was isolated from the biopsy samples and cDNA was prepared. The cDNA was subjected to Q-PCR with gene specific primers for pan macrophage marker (CD68), M1 macrophage markers (TREM-1, CD86, CCR-7, iNOS, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, CCR-2 and CCR-5) and M2 macrophage markers (TREM-2, CD163, CD206, IL-4 and IL-10). The expression fold changes of M1 and M2 markers in obese diabetics and obese non-diabetics were calculated when compared to non-obese subjects expression fold as 1. The fold changes are shown relative to GAPDH as housekeeping gene. Increase and decrease in folds of M1 or M2 expressions were regarded as up regulation and down regulation, respectively. This study is an extended work to our previous published articles on TREM-1, TREM-2, TNF-α and IL-6 gene expressions in non-obese and obese populations [23].
