Structural analyses of Ca 2+ /CaM interaction with Na V  channel C-termini reveal mechanisms of calcium-dependent regulation

Abstract

Ca2+ regulates voltage-gated Na+ (Na ) channels and perturbed Ca2+ regulation of Na  function is associated with epilepsy syndromes, autism, and cardiac arrhythmias. Understanding the disease mechanisms, however, has been hindered by a lack of structural information and competing models for how Ca2+ affects Na  channel function. Here, we report the crystal structures of two ternary complexes of a human Na  cytosolic C-terminal domain (CTD), a fibroblast growth factor homologous factor, and Ca2+/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM). These structures rule out direct binding of Ca2+ to the Na  CTD, and uncover new contacts between CaM and the Na  CTD. Probing these new contacts with biochemical and functional experiments allows us to propose a mechanism by which Ca2+ could regulate Na  channels. Further, our model provides hints towards understanding the molecular basis of the neurologic disorders and cardiac arrhythmias caused by Na  channel mutations.

Introduction

Na  channels underlie the rapid upstroke of action potentials. Mammalian Na  channels are pseudotetramers with 6-transmembrane segment repeats joined by intracellular linkers and flanked by intracellular N- and C-termini. The four repeats, which each contain a voltage sensor, assemble to form a central pore. Although recent crystal structures of the tetrameric bacterial Na  channel from Arcobacter butzleri (NavAb) provided detail about the pore and voltage sensors 1, 2, NavAb tetramers lack the intracellular linkers and termini of mammalian Na  channels. Those components are of particular interest because they confer isoform-specific regulatory effects, serve as sites of interaction for critical modulatory proteins, and are loci for many disease-causing mutations.

The C-terminal domain (CTD) is of particular interest because it exerts powerful effects upon channel inactivation 3 and is the interaction site for several auxiliary proteins that modulate channel function, such as calmodulin (CaM) and fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs), both of which regulate excitability through their CTD interactions 4, 5. Moreover, many disease-causing mutations localize to Na  CTDs or their associated proteins. Key examples include mutations in SCN1A and SCN2A (which encode the neuronal channels Na 1.1 and Na 1.2, respectively) that lead to various epilepsy syndromes, ataxia, and autism 6, 7, 8 or in the CTD of Na 1.5, the cardiac Na  channel encoded by SCN5A, which is a hotspot for mutations causing arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and sudden infant death syndrome 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Likewise, mutations in FHFs or CaM have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders, cognitive deficits, and arrhythmias 14, 15, 16. Structural information about Na  CTDs, however, has been limited. How the associated regulatory proteins influence channel function and how mutations in the CTDs or associated auxiliary proteins perturb channel function and at the molecular level are not well understood.

Among the proteins associated with Na  CTDs CaM is of particular interest because it acts as a sensor for Ca2+, which serves as a critical signal of electrical activity, providing powerful feedback regulation upon Na  channel function 17. Still, how Ca2+ and CaM affect Na  channels have been controversial since sequence analysis of Na  channels first revealed the presence of potential CaM-binding sites, including an “IQ” motif 5 and a potential Ca2+ binding site within the CTD 18. Obtaining an understanding for CaM regulation of Na  channels has been further complicated by apparent isoform-specific regulation. For example, CaM affects inactivation properties of the neuronal Na 1.6 but not the skeletal muscle Na 1.4 19. For the cardiac Na 1.5, CaM affects several different properties, including channel inactivation and persistent current 20, 21. Nevertheless, the identification of disease-causing mutations within or near the Na  IQ motifs of several Na  isoforms 6, 20, 22, 23, 24 highlights important roles for CaM. The potential significance of CaM-binding to Na  channels has been further spotlighted by recent exome sequencing studies in which searches for repeated rare variants or de novo mutations associated with autism identified SCN1A and SCN2A among the small list of loci 25, 26, 27; several of these cataloged Na  mutations cluster in and around the IQ motif.

A major barrier to understanding how Ca2+ and CaM act on Na  channels has been that structural information is limited to Ca2+-free CaM (apoCaM) interacting with the CTD. While such studies defined an interaction between the decalcified C-lobe of CaM and the IQ motif 28, 29, 30, those structures were unable to reveal how Ca2+ affects Na  function and did not provide insight into mechanisms for IQ motif disease mutations, including a familial autism mutation in the neuronal Na 1.2 channel 7 and a cardiac arrhythmia mutation in the cardiac Na 1.5 20 that fall outside of the apoCaM contact sites.

Here, we present crystal structures of Na 1.2 and Na 1.5 CTDs bound to Ca2+–CaM. Comparison with our previous structure obtained with apoCaM reveals novel and unexpected Ca2+–CaM contacts and stark differences in the overall conformation of the ternary complex, including a Ca2+-dependent interaction between the CaM N-lobe and an extended helix that contains the IQ motif. Together, these findings provide a basis for understanding the effects of specific disease-causing mutations within Na  CTD domains.

Results

Ternary complex structures of a NaV CTD, FHF, and Ca2+/CaM

To define how Ca2+ regulates Na  channels, we solved crystal structures of complexes containing a Na  CTD, Ca2+–CaM, and a FHF. FHFs are constitutive Na  subunits in brain 4, 31 and heart 32 and their inclusion allows us to compare Ca2+/CaM structures with our previous complex containing apoCaM 30. We tested several different combinations of FHFs and Na  CTDs with Ca2+/CaM and eventually succeeded in crystallizing two ternary complexes: a 6xHis-tagged human Na 1.5 CTD (amino acids 1773-1940), human FGF12B, and CaM; and a 6xHis-tagged human Na 1.2 CTD (amino acids 1777-1937), human FGF13U, and CaM. The sequences of the Na  CTDs are highly conserved among the subtypes (76% identities between Na 1.5 and Na 1.2, and 91% of the amino acids are conserved; Fig. 1a) and the solution structures of the proximal Na 1.2 CTD and Na 1.5 CTD are nearly identical 33, 34. Likewise, FGF12B and FGF13U are highly conserved (69% identities), and their crystal structures in the absence of any binding partners are similar 35. Thus, we anticipated significant similarities between the Na 1.2- and Na 1.5-containing complexes.

Both complexes were expressed in E. coli and purified in the presence of 2 mM Ca2+ by Co2+ affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. The two ternary complexes (combined M  ∼60 kDa) were stable and each eluted in a single peak on a size exclusion column (Supplementary Fig. 1). Their individual profiles were highly similar to each other and to what we observed for the ternary complex containing the Na 1.5 CTD, FGF13U, and CaM purified in EGTA, for which we had demonstrated a stoichiometry of 1:1:1 30.

The complex containing Na 1.2 CTD, FGF13U, and CaM (hereafter referred to as Na 1.2/Ca2+) was crystallized in the C2 space group with two copies of the ternary complex in each asymmetric unit. The crystals were grown in the presence of 2 mM Ca2+ and diffracted to 3.02 Å Bragg spacings. The experimental phases were derived by single anomalous dispersion from selenomethionine-substituted crystals and improved by two-fold non-crystallographic averaging, which yielded a good-quality electron density map (Supplementary Fig. 2a). The final model contains the Na 1.2 amino acids 1788-1929, FGF13U amino acids 11-158, and the CaM amino acids 7-149. The model was refined to R /R  of 21.5/24.6 % (Table 1). The ternary complex containing Na 1.5 CTD, FGF12B, and CaM (hereafter referred to as Na 1.5/Ca2+) was crystallized in the P3 21 space group with one copy of the ternary complex in each asymmetric unit. The crystals were grown in the presence of 2 mM Ca2+ and diffracted anisotropically to 3.8/5.4/6.0 Å Bragg spacings. Molecular replacement was performed to obtain the phases (see Methods for the details). The final model contains the Na 1.5 amino acids 1786-1927; FGF12B amino acids 12-152; and the CaM amino acid 7-148. Despite the resolution limit, the model refined to good statistics (R /R  of 26.2/31.8 %) and good geometry (Table 1 and Methods for the refinement). 2Fo-Fc OMIT map shows a good-quality electron density, supporting the accuracy of the model given the resolution (Supplementary Fig. 2B). There is no significant difference in the refinement statistics when the data was truncated to 6.0 Å (Table 1).

Figure 1B-C show the overall architecture of the Na 1.2/Ca2+ and Na 1.5/Ca2+ ternary complexes, respectively. In both complexes, the Na  CTD is comprised of one globular domain that contains an EF-hand fold followed by an extended helix that contains the IQ motif. We refer to this helix as the IQ domain. The FHF binds to the CTD globular domain and CaM binds to the IQ domain. When the Na 1.5/Ca2+ and the Na 1.2/Ca2+ structures were superimposed with respect to their IQ domain, structural conservation was observed within the region containing the IQ domain and CaM (r.m.s.d. of 1.7 Å) (Fig. 1D).

When the two structures (stripped of their respective CaM molecules) are superimposed relative to their respective CTD's globular domains together with FHFs, both Na  CTD globular domains and FHFs are very similar with the r.m.s.d of 0.89 Å, with their IQ domains out of register (Fig. 1E) due to different angles between their CTD's globular domain (along with FHFs) and their IQ domain. The different angle may reflect an isoform-specific structural difference or inherent flexibility between the two domains of Na  CTD.

To focus on the Ca2+ dependent conformational changes, we also superimposed our previously solved structure of a ternary complex of Na 1.5 CTD, FGF13, and CaM crystalized in the absence of Ca2+ 30, hereafter referred to as Na 1.5/-Ca2+. With the CaM molecules stripped for clarity, Fig. 1E shows that the difference in angle between the respective Na  CTD globular domains and the IQ domains is even more pronounced between Na 1.5/Ca2+ and Na 1.5/-Ca2+ than between Na 1.2/Ca2+ and Na 1.5/Ca2+ (Fig. 1E). Although it is possible that these rigid-body motions between the CTD globular domains and their respective IQ domains are associated with Ca2+ binding, these motions can also be due to inherent flexibility between these two domains. Because the Na 1.2/Ca2+ structure provides higher resolution than the Na 1.5/Ca2+ structure and the differences are otherwise minimal, subsequent analyses focus only on the Na 1.2/Ca2+ structure.

A Ca2+-dependent CaM N-lobe interaction with the IQ domain

The most significant effects of Ca2+ are the changes in the interactions between CaM and the respective IQ domains as shown in Figure 2A, B, in which the Na 1.2/Ca2+ and Na 1.5/-Ca2+ structures are aligned by their IQ domains. The CaM in the Na 1.5/-Ca2+ structure adopts an extended conformation with the α-helical interlobular linker between the CaM/N- and C-lobes holding the N-lobe away from the C-lobe that binds to the proximal portion (IQ motif) of the IQ domain. NMR structures of Ca2+-free CaM and an isolated IQ domain peptide from either Na 1.2 or Na 1.5 also showed an interaction between the CaM C-lobe and the IQ motif, but not the CaM N/lobe and the IQ domain 28, 29. In our new Na 1.2/Ca2+ structure, in contrast, the α-helical interlobular linker is unwound, thereby allowing the Ca2+-bound CaM N-lobe to envelope the distal portion of the IQ domain and provide additional contacts between the linker and the IQ domain and between the CaM N-lobe and the IQ domain that are not present in the absence of Ca2+. These new contacts include residues mutated in channelopathies, as discussed below.

Superposition of Na 1.5/-Ca2+ and Na 1.2/Ca2+ structures shows that there are only minor conformational changes with respect to CaM C-lobe. In both structures, the CaM C-lobe adopts the “semi-open” conformation (Fig. 2C) that was first described for apoCaM bound to an IQ motif from an unconventional myosin 36. Significant conformational changes, however, occurred within the N-lobe of CaM, which assumes a “closed” conformation in the Na 1.2/Ca2+ structure (Fig. 2C and 2D), similar to the conformation observed for the N-lobe of Ca2+/CaM bound to its target peptide in CaMKII 37. For comparison, in the Na 1.5/-Ca2+ structure the unbound CaM N-lobe displays the “semi-open” conformation 30. Additionally, the arrangement of CaM lobes with respect to the IQ domain is novel to the best of our knowledge (see Discussion for the further details).

These conformation differences of the individual CaM lobes in the Na 1.2/Ca2+ structure suggested that the C-lobe was unlikely to be fully occupied while the N-lobe is saturated with Ca2+. To test this hypothesis we collected data for the Na 1.2/Ca2+ crystals at a long wavelength (1.55 Å), for which the anomalous scattering power of Ca2+ (f″ ∼1.2 e) is higher than that of sulfur (∼0.6 e) while that of Mg2+ is nearly silent (∼0.1 e). Although we observed strong anomalous difference Fourier peaks in the Ca2+-binding loops of the CaM N-lobes, only weak peaks were observed in the Ca2+-binding loops of the CaM C-lobe (Supplementary Fig. 3), suggesting that the affinity for Ca2+ in the CaM C-lobe of Na 1.2/Ca2+ is low (compared to the CaM N-lobe) and that the CaM C-lobe is only partially occupied with Ca2+, consistent with the semi-open conformation of the CaM C-lobe.

This newly discovered interaction between the CaM N-lobe and the distal C-terminal portion of the IQ domain is driven mainly through van der Waals forces (Fig. 2E), burying Na 1.2 hydrophobic side chains (Leu1920, Leu1921, Val1925, and Val1928) and has functional and disease-related implications. First, this additional interaction between the distal IQ domain and the CaM N-lobe offers an explanation for a previous report that an Ala1924Thr mutation in the cardiac Na 1.5 channel (equivalent to Val1928 in Na 1.2) causes the life-threatening arrhythmia Brugada Syndrome and eliminates the Ca2+/CaM-dependent slow inactivation observed for the wild-type Na 1.5 channel 20. We hypothesized that the Ala1924Thr mutation in the Na 1.5 CTD affected the affinity for Ca2+/CaM, and tested the hypothesis by isothermal calorimetry (ITC). Indeed, in the presence of saturating 5 mM Ca2+, the mutation reduced the affinity for Ca2+/CaM by ∼ 3-fold compared to the wild-type Na 1.5 CTD (Supplementary Fig. 4A and Table 2). In contrast, the affinity of the mutant Na 1.5 CTD for CaM in the absence of Ca2+ was mildly increased (Table 2). Second, we found that the CaM N-lobe interaction with the distal IQ domain provides a significant boost to the affinity of Ca2+/CaM for the Na  CTD. A previous report using ITC 38 had found the affinity of Ca2+/CaM for a Na 1.5 peptide containing the IQ motif to be ∼ 2.1 μM. Those thermodynamic parameters, however, were obtained in experiments employing an IQ domain in which the newly discovered CaM N-lobe contact site is truncated. We therefore performed ITC with a longer Na 1.5 CTD (through amino acid 1940), and observed a significantly higher affinity for both Ca2+/CaM and apoCaM (∼100 nM, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4A-B and Table 2). To assure that the lower K  values we obtained were indeed due to the longer CTD and not to technical differences, we measured the affinity of CaM for the Na 1.5 CTD truncated at amino acid 1924, for which we obtained a value of 2.0 ± 0.4 μM in 5 mM Ca2+ (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4B). This result is in excellent agreement with the value previously obtained 38, thereby allowing us to benchmark our thermodynamic data against that report. Thus, the ∼ 20-fold higher affinity for CaM obtained with the longer CTD highlights critical contributions of the more distal IQ domain residues. Comparison of the N values of interactions for Ca2+/CaM with the two CTDs by ITC (Table 2) further demonstrates the importance of the more distal residues in the IQ domain. For the shorter CTD, the N value of the Ca2+/CaM-CTD interaction is close to ∼0.5 (0.38 in our measurement; and 0.56 previously reported 38), suggesting that one Ca2+/CaM can bind two CTDs. The N value we obtained for the longer CTD was doubled (0.84), suggesting that one Ca2+/CaM binds one CTD, and fits well with our crystallographic observation that both N- and C-lobes simultaneously bind to different sites within the IQ domain of Na  CTD. Consistent with our observation, N value of the interaction between Ca2+/CaM and Ala1924Thr of the longer CTD is reduced to half of the wild type (0.42) (Table 2). Thus, these data underlined the importance of the interaction between CaM and the more distal region of the IQ domain and supported a model in which there are simultaneous interactions of the two CaM lobes (at different sites on the IQ domain).

Ca2+-dependent changes and disease mechanisms

While the new CaM N-lobe contact with the Na 1.2 CTD is the most obvious Ca2+-dependent structural change, we also identified additional new Ca2+/CaM contact sites within the Na 1.2 IQ domain, which may provide insight for several other Na  channelopathies. For example, Arg1918 (Fig. 3A, B), which contacts Asp79 and Ser82 in the CaM interlobular linker in the Ca2+-loaded complex (but not in the apoCaM structure), was reported in a patient with febrile seizures and childhood absence epilepsy 23, and mutation of the equivalent Arg1928 in the homologous Na 1.1 was found in a patient with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy 24.

Also of particular interest was a familial autism mutation Arg1902Cys in Na 1.2 7, particularly since recent analyses of rare de novo mutations in subjects with autism have identified SCN2A as one of a handful of high-confidence autism spectrum disorder genes 25, 39. Arg1902 sits at the hinge between the CTD globular domain and the IQ domain helix (Fig. 3C). We had previously found that the Arg1902Cys mutation conferred a Ca2+/CaM-dependent conformational change indicated by a significant Ca2+-dependent shift in migration on a size exclusion column of a Na 1.2 CTD/CaM binary complex that was not observed with the wild type complex 21. Although Arg1902 (or the Arg1898 equivalent in Na 1.5) does not make any direct contacts with CaM either in the presence or absence of Ca2+, it interacts with the side chain of Glu1905 (Glu1901 in Na 1.5) one turn below along the IQ domain helix and also forms cation-π interaction with the side chain of Tyr98 in FGF13 in the Na 1.5/-Ca2+ structure. Tyr98 in FGF13 and Glu1905 in Na 1.2 (Glu1901 in Na 1.5) also interact with Lys95 within the third CaM EF-hand in the CaM C-lobe. Interestingly, Glu1905 in Na 1.2, Tyr98 in FGF13, and Lys95 in CaM are the only residues within the ternary complex that make interactions with each of the other partners. Thus, we suspected that the relayed interactions from Lys95 (CaM) through Glu1905 (Nav IQ domain) to Arg1902 (Nav globular domain), stabilized by the cation-π interaction with Tyr98 in FGF13, suppress the Ca2+ dependence of Na 1.2 channels and that disruption of these interactions would affect Ca2+-dependent regulation of Na 1.2 channels (Fig. 3C). We tested this hypothesis in two ways.

First, we expressed either wild type or Arg1902Cys mutant Na 1.2 along with FGF14, the best characterized neuronal FHF 4, 31, 40 in HEK293 cells, in which endogenous CaM is abundant, and recorded Na+ currents in the presence of saturating internal Ca2+ or nominally zero internal Ca2+ (Supplementary Fig. 5) For wild type NaV1.2, inclusion of 10 μM Ca2+ in the patch pipette did not affect peak current density, the V1/2 of activation, or the V1/2 of steady-state inactivation. In contrast, for the Arg1902Cys mutant the addition of Ca2+ induced a large ∼-10 mV shift in the V1/2 of steady-state activation and inactivation (Fig. 3D, Supplementary Fig. 6A, and Supplementary Table 1). To test further our hypothesis that disruption of the Na  CTD to CaM relay affected Ca2+-dependent regulation of Na 1.2, we ablated the key intermediary by mutating Na 1.2 Glu1905 to Gln. Recordings from the Glu1905Gln mutant channels phenocopied those from the Arg1902Cys mutant channels (Supplementary Fig. 6A and Supplementary Table 1). Second, to test the proposed role of Arg1902 in the relayed interactions in Na 1.2 CTD/apoCaM, we measured the affinity of apoCaM for the wild type and Arg1902Cys mutant Na 1.2 CTDs by ITC. Consistent with our hypothesis, the Arg1902Cys mutation reduced affinity of apoCaM for the Na 1.2 CTD significantly (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4C). We did not observe a difference in affinity for Ca2+/CaM between the wild type and the Arg1902Cys mutant CTD (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4D). Because our ITC measurement in the presence of Ca2+ could be complicated by an additional binding process due to Ca2+-loading of the CaM C-lobe, which is essentially unoccupied in the Na 1.2/+Ca2+ structure (Supplementary Fig. 3), we therefore prepared CaM in which the third and fourth EF hands were mutated to ablate Ca2+ binding to the CaM C-lobe 41 and repeated the ITC measurements with this crippled CaM  mutant. The ITC experiment with the CaM  mutant showed a reduced affinity for the Arg1902Cys mutant compared to the wild CTD in the presence of Ca2+ (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4E). Thus these data are consistent with the previously observed shift in mobility on gel filtration of the Arg1902Cys/CaM binary complex 21 and suggest that by disrupting the relayed interactions to CaM the familial autism Na 1.2 Arg1902Cys mutation revealed Ca2+-dependent effects upon channel function that were suppressed in the wild type channel.

We next investigated whether the Ca2+-dependent interaction of the CaM N lobe was required for the Ca2+-dependent regulation of Na 1.2 exposed by the Arg1902Cys mutation. We mutated Val1925, one of the Na 1.2 hydrophobic side chains buried by the calcified CaM N lobe (see Fig. 2E), to Lys and examined how this mutant affected the Ca2+-dependent shift in activation and steady-state inactivation in the context of the Arg1902Cys mutant. With this additional Val1925Lys mutation, The Arg1902Cys mutant no longer displayed any Ca2+-dependent effects on either activation or steady-state inactivation (Supplementary Fig. 6B and Supplementary Table 1), thereby implicating a requirement for the interaction between the calcified CaM N lobe and Na 1.2. When analyzed independently, Val1925Lys did not expose any Ca2+-dependent regulation (Supplementary Fig. 6B and Supplementary Table 1).

Ca2+ binding is restricted to calmodulin

Our analyses suggested that Ca2+-dependent regulation of Na  channel function derives from Ca2+-dependent changes in the interaction between CaM and the Na  CTD, yet it has previously been suggested that Ca2+ also affects Na  channels by binding directly to an EF-hand motif within the Na  CTD influences Na  channel function 18, 34, 42. To query whether Ca2+ can bind directly to the Na  CTD EF-hand motif, we used our anomalous scattering studies. Even though we detected anomalous difference signals from many sulfur atoms (in methionines) whose signal is ∼2-fold weaker than that for Ca2+, we did not detect anomalous difference signal for Ca2+ within the proposed Ca2+-binding loops (Fig. 4A) and we observed a strong signal for Ca2+ bound to the CaM N-lobe (Supplementary Fig. 3). Comparing the acidic and polar residues proposed to coordinate Ca2+ in the putative Na  CTD EF-hand 18 with those in the Ca2+-binding EF hands in the CaM N-lobe of the associated CaM provides an explanation. While both EF hands of the Ca2+-loaded CaM N-lobe contain a sufficient number of acidic and polar residues (a total of five) positioned to coordinate Ca2+ in an optimal geometry (Fig. 4B and see Fig. 2D), the Na  CTD EF hand does not (Fig. 4B). Thus, we conclude that the Na  CTD EF hand does not likely bind Ca2+; Ca2+-dependent effects on Na  channel function are more likely mediated via CaM.

Discussion

Whether and how Ca2+ contributes to the regulation of voltage-gated Na  currents has been a focus of significant controversy since potential CaM binding sites were first identified within Na  CTDs 5. Our new structural model with Ca2+/CaM bound to the Na 1.2 CTD, in context with previous structures demonstrating the interaction of apoCaM with various Na  CTDs 28, 29, 30, reveals novel and unexpected interactions between the Ca2+-loaded CaM and the Na  CTD. The apoCaM structures showed that the CaM C-lobe is anchored to the signature IQ motif within the extended IQ domain. On the basis of our new structural, biochemical, and functional data we propose that a major action of Ca2+ is to induce a conformational switch in the anchored CaM so that the CaM N-lobe swings into contact with the distal IQ domain while the Ca2+-free CaM C-lobe remains anchored to the IQ motif (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, the new contact site for the calcified CaM N-lobe sits within a previously identified peptide that, when isolated from the adjacent IQ motif peptide, could only bind Ca2+-loaded CaM, in contrast to the IQ motif that supported apoCaM binding over Ca2+/CaM binding 5. Additionally, we observed that Ca2+ induces rearrangements between the Na  CTD and the CaM intralobular linker, and between the Na  CTD and the CaM C-lobe (Fig. 3). We hypothesize that, together, these conformational changes may be propagated to the adjacent DIV transmembrane region of the channel to thereby affect Na  function in an isoform-specific manner. Since our structures do not contain the transmembrane region of the channel, our model cannot explain how the conformational changes propagate to DIV. However, it is known that the conformational change of DIV voltage sensor (S4) is the rate-limiting step for channel inactivation 43, 44. Thus, the Na  CTD is in an advantageous position to affect channel gating.

Interestingly, the specific Ca2+/CaM-dependent effects appear to vary among different Na  channels 19. Our data add to that concept in that we found that the wild type Na 1.2 channel, not previously studied, was insensitive to Ca2+/CaM for the parameters we studied at either nominally zero or saturating (∼ 10 μM) intracellular Ca2+. While the specific concentrations of internal Ca2+ studied here are outside the range of physiologic Ca2+ in neurons, these two levels allowed us to explore the bounds of Ca2+, and correlate to our structures, obtained in the absence or presence of Ca2+. These studies were also performed in the presence of a FHF, which was a component of the crystalized ternary complexes. Whether FHFs influence the Ca2+-dependence of Na  currents has not yet been analyzed. However, their inclusion in the functional studies is appropriate not only because of their presence in the crystal structures, but also because of growing evidence that FHFs are important regulators of Na  currents in the neurons and cardiomyocytes 4, 16, 32, 45 in which Na 1.2 and Na 1.5 are expressed.

Nevertheless, the familial autism mutation Arg1902Cys introduced a large Ca2+-dependent shift in both channel activation and steady-state inactivation (Fig. 3 and discussed below). A gain-of-function effect of a channelopathic mutation is reminiscent to the mechanism by which mutations in Na 1.5 lead to Long QT Syndrome 9, 10 and in some Na 1.2 mutations associated with epilepsy 46. Combined with analysis of the Na 1.2/Ca2+ structure, our functional data suggests that the relayed interactions from Lys95 (CaM) through Glu1905 (Nav IQ domain) to Arg1902 (Nav globular domain) mask a Ca2+-dependent shift in wild type Na 1.2 that is revealed by the Arg1902Cys familial autism mutant when the relay is disrupted. It is noteworthy that an Asp96Val mutation adjacent to Lys95 in CaM, recently reported in a patient with an arrhythmia syndrome, was also associated with moderate cognitive impairment 14.

Taken together, we suggest that similar Ca2+-induced conformational changes of CaM in both Na 1.2 and Na 1.5 (interactions of the CaM N-lobe to the distal IQ domain of Na  CTD) might be responsible for Ca2+-dependent regulation, and that their functional effects are isoform-specific. The concept that Ca2+-dependent regulation may be isoform-specific is consistent with a recent report showing that a rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+ diminished transient Na  currents through Na 1.4, but not through the Na 1.5 isoform 47. With regard to Na 1.2, only Arg1902Cys or Glu1905Gln unveiled a Ca2+-dependent functional effect. We reasoned that there are possible reasons for these isoform-specific differences of Ca2+ dependence. First, in the context of the full-length channels, it is possible that the conformational changes at the CTD could propagate to the DIV transmembrane region of the channel differently depending on the isoforms. The apparent isoform-specific difference in the angle between the Na  globular domain and the extended IQ domain reported herein (Fig. 1e) provide one possibility. For example, perhaps the difference in the angle within Na 1.2 masks the Ca2+-dependent changes in Na 1.2 wild-type channel function initiated by the Ca2+-dependent CaM N-lobe interaction. Second, it is possible that there are unexamined functional parameters that are more relevant to Ca2+-dependent regulations that are less-isoform specific. Third, it is possible that Ca2+/CaM does not mediate the observed Ca2+-dependent changes in functions of Na 1.2 Arg1902Cys or Glu1905Gln. However, the fact that Val1925Lys mutation (in the background of Arg1902Cys) abolishes the Ca2+-dependent functional effect eliminates this possibility, as Val1925Lys would disrupt the binding of the CaM N-lobe to the distal IQ motif of Na 1.2.

While mutagenesis studies have yielded suggestions about how Ca2+/CaM regulates Na  channel function 18, 19, 21, 38, 42, 48, 49, human disease mutations can be particularly revealing. By identifying new Ca2+/CaM-dependent contacts with the Na  CTD and demonstrating Ca2+-dependent conformation changes within the complex, our data provide a context in which to consider the effects of disease mutations that affect Na  CTD-CaM interaction. Several epilepsy mutations in Na 1.1 or Na 1.2 are in residues that make different contacts with Ca2+/CaM compared to apoCaM (Fig. 3) as are additional Na 1.1 and Na 1.2 mutations associated with sporadic and familial cases of autism 7, 25, 26. Further, our analysis of the effects of the Na 1.2 Arg1902Cys familial autism mutation demonstrates that disruption of the wild type interaction between the CaM C-lobe and the CTD induces a Ca2+-dependent change for the mutant Na 1.2 channel function. The marked hyperpolarizing shift in both Na 1.2 activation and inactivation induced by the Arg1902Cys autism mutation would affect neuronal excitability in Na 1.2 expressing neurons, thus leading to an imbalance between excitation and inhibition known to drive neuropsychiatric phenotypes 50. Additionally, our identification of the Ca2+-dependent CaM N-lobe interaction with the distal IQ domain, not predicted by previous structural studies, provides a molecular mechanism for the Ca2+-dependent dysfunction of the Na 1.5 Ala1924Thr Brugada Syndrome mutation 20. Finally, our data provide a potential mechanism for the recently described mutations in CaM associated with arrhythmias and cognitive deficits 14.

The Ca2+-loaded ternary complexes present several unusual and novel features for a CaM-containing complex. Among these are the dissimilar conformations of the CaM N-lobe and CaM C-lobe when calcified CaM is bound to the IQ domain (Fig. 2C). While the different conformations of the individual CaM lobes in our structures mirror the CaM lobe conformations seen in the SK K+ channel structure, the interactions between CaM and its target peptide(s) are markedly different. Within the SK K+ channel homotetramer, the calcified CaM N-lobe wraps around one helix from the C-terminus of a protomer but the apoCaM C-lobe interacts with two helices from a different protomer within the tetramer 51. Split roles for CaM lobes have also been suggested for Ca2+-dependent regulation of Ca  channels 52, 53, 54, with one lobe responsible for mediating changes to global Ca2+ while the other responds to changes in local Ca2+. Comparison of our structures with Ca  Ca2+ channel-derived structure provides an interesting contrast in structure and mechanisms by which Ca2+ regulates ion channel function, particularly since voltage-gated Na+ channels and Ca2+ channels are similar in sequence within their proximal CTDs. The similarities include not only the IQ domain to which CaM binds but also an EF hand motif in the Ca 1.2 L-type Ca2+ channel that was hypothesized to serve as a site for Ca2+-dependent regulation 55, but (similar to the EF-hand in the Na  CTD) has also never been shown to bind Ca2+ with a physiologically meaningful affinity. In spite of these similarities in sequence, structures of the Ca  CTDs bound to CaM are surprisingly different from what we observe for the Na  CTDs. Foremost among these differences is that the Ca  CTD/CaM complexes crystallized as a dimer of CTDs, and each CTD interacted with two CaM molecules for an overall stoichiometry of 4 CaM and 2 CTDs 56, 57. Whether the dimerization of channels observed in the structure is functionally relevant has been debated. Nevertheless, the 2:1 stoichiometry between CaM and the Ca 1.2 CTD contrasts markedly with the 1:1 stoichiometry between CaM and a Na  CTD. With these differences, it is not surprising that the overall fold of the Ca 1.2 CTD does not resemble the Na  CTDs.

Even focusing specifically on the interactions between Ca2+/CaM and the respective IQ domains, the structures reveal stark differences (Fig. 5A-C). First, the arrangement of CaM with respect to the Na  IQ domain is very different than Ca  IQ domains. In both Ca 1.2 and Ca 2.1 IQ domains, CaM wraps around the IQ motif in a right-handed helical fashion, regardless of the relative orientation of the IQ motifs (parallel or antiparallel to CaM lobes). On the contrary, CaM wraps around the Na  IQ domain in a left-handed helical fashion. Second, the overall Ca2+/CaM footprint on the Na  IQ domain is longer. The signature IQ motif in Ca  channels forms a central anchor for Ca2+/CaM interactions with both CaM lobes, while the IQ motif residues in the Na  structures form contacts mostly with the CaM's Ca2+-free C-lobe. Thus, the Ca2+/CaM N-lobe is located further towards the C-terminus on the Na  IQ domains compared to the Ca  IQ domains. A search of the Dali database 58 suggesting that the CaM conformation in the Na 1.2/Ca2+ and Na 1.5/Ca2+ structures is novel.

Together with this novel interaction mode between CaM and the Na 1.2 CTDs, our structural, biochemical, and functional data provide a new framework for understanding how CaM affects Na  channels in physiology and disease.

Methods

Molecular biology

The following plasmids, for protein expression and purification, have been previously described: For crystallization the human Na 1.5 CTD (amino acids 1773-1940) and Na 1.2 (amino acids 1777-1937) were cloned into pET28 (Novagen) 21; the human FGF13U (accession # NM_033642) and FGF12B were cloned into the second multiple cloning site of pETDuet-1 (Novagen) 59; and CaM was cloned into pSGC02 21. For isothermal titration calorimetry, human Na 1.5 CTD amino acids 1773-1924, Na 1.5 CTD amino acids 1773-1940 (and the Ala1924Thr mutant) were cloned into pET28. For electrophysiology, Na 1.2 was in pcDNA3.1 and FGF14b has previously been described 60. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with QuikChange (Stratagene).

Recombinant protein expression and co-purification

The three plasmids for His6-Nav1.5 CTD, FGF12B, and CaM or His6-Nav1.2 CTD, FGF13U and CaM were co-electroporated into BL-21 (DE3) cells. Proteins were grown in LB medium or M9 medium as described 30. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM imidazole, 2 mM CaCl , pH 7.5, supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). The initial purification protocol has been previously described 30. Additional purification was performed by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 10/300L column on an AKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare) in 300 mM NaCl, 20mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM imidazole, with 2 mM CaCl  pH 7.5. Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance with Thermo NANODROP and were concentrated to A  = 12 in above buffer for crystallization. For ITC experiments, the single plasmid was electroporated into BL-21 (DE3) cells and the proteins were expressed after induction with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 16h at 20°C. CaM protein was purified as previously described 41.

Crystallization, data collection and structure determination

Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion with the sitting-drop method. His6-Nav1.5 CTD, FGF12B, and Ca2+/CaM crystals were obtained with 20% PEG3350, 0.18 M MgSO , 0.1 M sodium iodide, and 2 mM CaCl . His6-Nav1.2 CTD, FGF13U, and CaM selenomethionine incorporated proteins crystals were obtained with 14% pEG3350, 300 mM sodium acetate, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, and 2 mM CaCl . Before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen, the crystals were cryoprotected by gradually increasing the concentration of glycerol in the well solution to 20%.

Crystals of selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted Na 1.2 in complex with Ca2+/CaM and FGF13 diffract to 3.02 Å Bragg spacings with the space group C2 and crystals of human Na 1.5 CTD in complex with Ca2+/CaM and FGF12B diffract to 3.8 Å /5.4 Å /6 Å with the space group P3 21 (Table 1). As for the structure determination of the complex of Na 1.2 CTD, Ca2+-CaM, and FGF13U, experimental phases were obtained from the SeMet-substituted complex using single anomalous dispersion (SAD). After initial automatic model building, model building was completed manually. The final model contains two complexes in the asymmetric unit and is refined to R/R  of 21.5/24.6% with good geometry (Table 1). The model contains residues 1788 to 1929 of Nav1.2. As for the structure determination of the complex of Na 1.5, Ca2+-CaM, and FGF12B, molecular replacement was performed to obtain the phases. In brief, the EF hand domain (residue 1786-1896) together with FGF13 from the previous Nav1.5 CTD structure in complex with FGF13U structure and Mg2+-CaM (PDB ID:4DCK), IQ domain (residue 1899-1919) from the same complex structure, and the C-lobe of Mg2+-CaM (residue 85-145) were used as independent search models and used to find the solutions using Phaser 61. After the solution was found, the N-lobe of CaM was manually placed using F -F  map. Low-resolution structure refinement was performed using the reference model as the complex of Nav1.2, Ca2+/CaM and FGF13. The serious anisotropy of amplitudes were corrected using the UCLA Diffraction Anisotropy Server (http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/anisoscale) 62 and was used for the refinement. The final model contains one complex in the asymmetric unit and is of good quality with R/R  of 26.0/31.8% (Table 1).

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry

Experiments were performed with an ITC-200 (MicroCal) at 20 °C. The solutions containing the wild type Na 1.5 CTD, Na 1.2 CTD , Na 1.2 CTD R1902C mutation, Na 1.5 CTD amino acids 1773-1924, truncation mutant, or A1924T mutant (25-35 μM) were titrated with 1 injection of 5 μl and 27 injections of 10 μl of solutions containing CaM or CaM  (240-310 μM). ITC experiments were repeated with different preparations and different concentrations at least three times to confirm thermodynamic parameters and stoichiometry values. The binding isotherms were analyzed with a single site binding model using the Microcal Origin version 7.0 software package (Originlab Corporation), yielding binding enthalpy (ΔH), stoichiometry (n), entropy (ΔS), and association constant (K ). Results are presented as mean ± standard error; statistical significance was assessed using a two-tailed Student's t-test and was set at P < 0.05.

Electrophysiology

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were plated on 60-mm tissue culture dishes and grown to 65%–75% confluence, then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with a total 6 μg of cDNAs encoding Na 1.2, FGF14b, β1, and β2 at a ratio of 2:1:1. One day after transfection, the cells were re-plated on coverslips coated with 50 μg/ml poly-D-lysine (Sigma) for electrophysiological recordings. Transfected cells were identified by GFP fluorescence. Na+ currents were recorded using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique at room temperature (20-22 °C) 48-72 h after transfection. Electrode resistance ranged from 2.5-2.5 MΩ. Currents were filtered at 2.9 kHz and digitized at 20 Hz using an EPC 10 USB patch amplifier (HEKA Elektronik). Cells were allowed to stabilize for 7-10 min after the whole-cell configuration was established. Cells expressing peak currents amplitude >6000 pA were excluded from kinetic analyses because of suboptimal voltage control, as were cells exhibiting peak current amplitudes <600 pA to avoid contamination by endogenous currents. All cells were included in analyses of current density. The liquid junction potential, series resistance and leak current for these recordings were not corrected, and cells were discarded if series resistance was >8 MΩ. The bath solution contained (in mM): NaCl 124, TEA-Cl 20, CaCl  2.0, MgCl  1, HEPES 5, glucose 10, pH 7.3 (adjusted with NaOH). The intracellular “0 Ca2+” solution contained (in mM): CsCl  60, L-aspartic acid 80, 1,2-bis(o-amino phenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) 10, HEPES 10, pH 7.35 (adjusted with CsOH). The intracellular “10 μM Ca2+” solution contained (in mM): CsCl  60, L-aspartic acid 80, BAPTA 1, CaCl  1, HEPES 10, pH 7.30 (adjusted with CsOH). Osmolarity was adjusted to 310 mOsm with sucrose for all solutions. The voltage-clamp protocols were generated by PatchMaster. Cells were voltage-clamped at a holding potential (Vh) of -120 mV, and currents were elicited by depolarizing pulses of 40 ms from -120 mV to +45 mV in 5 mV increments. Current density was calculated by normalizing to cell capacitance. Activation curves were obtained by transforming current data to conductance (G), which was calculated from the equation G  = I/(V - Erev), where: I is the peak Na+ current elicited by the depolarizing test potential; V is the test potential; and Erev is the calculated Na+ reversal potential. The ratio G/G  was plotted against the membrane potential and fitted with the Boltzmann equation of the form: G / G =(1+exp[(V-V )/k])-1, where Gmax is the extrapolated maximum conductance, V is the test voltage, V  is the half-activation voltage, and k is the slope factor. Standard two-pulse protocols were used to generate the steady-state inactivation curves: from a holding potential of -120 mV, cells were stepped to 500-ms preconditioning potentials varying between -130 mV and -10 mV (prepulse) in 5 mV increments, followed by a 20 ms test pulse to -20 mV. Currents (I) were normalized to I  and fit to a Boltzmann function of the form I/Imax =1/(1+exp((Vm-V1/2)/k)) in which V  is the voltage at which half of Na 1.5 channels are inactivated, k is the slope factor and V  is the membrane potential. Data analysis was performed using FitMaster (HEKA Elektronik) and Origin 8 software. Results are presented as means ± standard error; the statistical significance of differences between groups was assessed using a two-tailed Student's t-test and was set at P< 0.05.
