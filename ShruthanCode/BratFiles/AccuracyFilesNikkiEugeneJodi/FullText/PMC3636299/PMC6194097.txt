Effective uses of social media in public health and medicine: a systematic review of systematic reviews

Abstract

Introduction

Research examining the effective uses of social media (SM) in public health and medicine, especially in the form of systematic reviews (SRs), has grown considerably in the past decade. To our knowledge, no comprehensive synthesis of this literature has been conducted to date.

Aims and methods

To conduct a systematic review of systematic reviews of the benefits and harms (“effects”) of SM tools and platforms (such as Twitter and Facebook) in public health and medicine. To perform a synthesis of this literature and create a ‘living systematic review’.

Results

Forty-two (42) high-quality SRs were examined. Overall, evidence of SM’s effectiveness in public health and medicine was judged to be minimal. However, qualitative benefits for patients are seen in improved psychosocial support and psychological functioning. Health professionals benefited from better peer-to-peer communication and lifelong learning. Harms on all groups include the impact of SM on mental health, privacy, confidentiality and information reliability.

Conclusions

A range of negatives and positives of SM in public health and medicine are seen in the SR literature but definitive conclusions cannot be made at this time. Clearly better research designs are needed to measure the effectiveness of social technologies.

Introduction

The emergence of social media (SM) and social networking services to communicate in real-time and on-the-go by patients and health professionals was recognized as an important public health development more than a decade ago [1-3].

In 2007, Kamel Boulos described social networking services (SNSs) as collaborative, mediated environments [4], where personal computers and mobile devices can be used to foster stronger connections, and new forms of information can be shared. Some examples of SM types are wikis (e.g., Wikipedia), social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn), media-sharing sites (e.g., YouTube, SlideShare), blogs and micro-blogs (e.g., Blogger, Twitter), immersive worlds (e.g., Second Life), and 3-D virtual globes (e.g., Google Earth) [4].

According to the Pew Research Centre, the popularity of SNSs is linked to the adoption of healthier lifestyles and coping skills for day-to-day health concerns [5]. Pew reports that patients enjoy helping each other and sharing their healthcare experiences [5]. Patients say that the Internet is a helpful way to find answers to health problems; in fact, the research shows that frequent use of social networks is associated with increased patient awareness and empowerment [6]. Health professionals have increased their social networking via Twitter, Facebook, blogs, vlogs (video blogs, e.g., on YouTube), infotainment, games and infographics [7].

Background

In a 2013 systematic review, Moorhead et al. identified seven key ways that SM are being used in healthcare:

Social media research has improved considerably in the past decade. In fact, better empirical research is now conducted, and many higher quality studies are being published [8-10]. The aim in this SR is to conduct a qualitative synthesis of systematic reviews of the effective uses of SM in public health and medicine, both for patients and health professional groups.

Methods

This paper is a systematic review and qualitative synthesis of papers published between 2003 to 2017. The authors perform a systematic review of SRs as the volume of primary papers would have made meaningful synthesis of that literature impossible. We selected the SR methodology as it provided a more complete view of the literature and varying interventions, populations and settings. In addition, different types of papers can be compared and contrasted [11].

In exploring the relationships between studies, this SR aims to answer two questions.

At the start, we registered our protocol at PROSPERO, the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews [12]. Here, we follow the ENTREQ guidelines to enhance the transparency of our methods and to improve the reporting of the qualitative evidence [13].

Information sources: bibliographic databases and search engines

Comprehensive searches were performed in fifteen bibliographic databases and search engines from 1995 to 2017 (Table I).

Reference harvesting and citation searches were conducted in Google Scholar and in the Web of Science. To locate recent papers, the authors also created current awareness alerts in databases such as MEDLINE, Embase, the Web of Science and Google Scholar. Key journals and prominent e-health journals were identified using the Web of Science and searched iteratively to increase sensitivity and to overcome any indexing deficiencies (Table II). As the top impact factor journals in e-health were available online, manual searching was conducted by scanning online tables of contents and by using the journals’ search engines.

Search terms – effective uses of social media in healthcare

The search strategies for MEDLINE and Embase were developed based on the strategies reported by Moorhead [8] and Hamm [9], and adapted accordingly. To achieve optimal sensitivity, we created strategies that combined keywords with controlled or index terms (Table III).

The following terms were added at various points in combination to refine and filter results:

The full search strategy for Ovid MEDLINE is listed in Appendix A.

Data extraction and analysis

Our searches yielded 8521 papers from 15 bibliographic databases, search engines and manual searches (reference harvesting and citation searching). Our results were imported into RefWorks for title and abstract screening and results were loaded into MS Excel. The CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) tool for systematic reviews was used to assess the quality of papers [14]. We performed a thematic analysis using methods as described by Braun and Clarke [15].

Titles and abstracts of retrieved citations were independently coded and assessed by two reviewers (DG, SMA). Papers viewed as eligible were obtained in full-text and assessed further using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any disagreement between reviewers was resolved by a third (MNKB). Reasons for exclusion were recorded using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Our aim was to describe and synthesize papers but we did not attempt to determine effect sizes in the studies.

In Excel, we created columns and rows to describe the papers and their features, and piloted our spreadsheet for data extraction. Variables included the type of systematic searches performed, timeframe of searches, number of studies included, types of studies, SM tools and SNS platforms examined, study and population characteristics, focus on the interventions, outcomes measured and results, author conclusions, and broader themes and categories.

Results

In our searches, we identified a total of 8375 papers: 2051 in MEDLINE, 4075 in EMBASE, 1062 in CINAHL, 562 in PsycINFO, and a total of 625 from the remaining databases. Reference harvesting, search engine and manual searching added 146 papers for a total of 8521 papers ( ).

Deduplication and screening reduced the number of papers to 232 which were assessed for eligibility using full-text. This reduced yield to 102 papers which were then critically appraised using CASP. Two reviewers independently provided scores out of 10 for each paper by indicating “yes” to each of ten items on the CASP checklist. We had strong inter-rater agreement of the 102 papers (an overall agreement of 92%). Discrepancies were adjudicated by a third reviewer. In the analysis, 42 papers scored high (9 out of 10) or a perfect 10 out of 10 score.

Study validity

A summary of the quality assessment of the 42 papers is contained in Appendix B.

Study populations

The study populations in the 42 papers dealt mostly with patients (n=30), health professionals or health students (n=8), or both patients and health professionals (n=4). Ages ranged from young adults averaging 18 years of age up to adults in their senior years. The maximum age in the three studies that examined the effects of SM on older (senior) people was up to 80 years of age.

Publication years of papers

In our inclusion set, 34 papers were published between 2014 and 2016. In 2014, there were 12 papers published, with 13 papers in 2015 and 9 papers in 2016. Six papers were published between 2010 and 2013, and two papers were published in an early period from 2004 to 2009. The authors observed a marked increase in the number of papers published starting in 2010. (Since our searches were conducted to December 2016, we have seen a sharp increase in the numbers of papers published in 2017 and 2018 – a major reason why we have made this a living systematic review but more about that later.)

Description of the included reviews

The summary of the 42 systematic reviews in this paper are listed in Appendix C. The papers were published from 2004 to 2016. All but two (Eysenbach et al., 2004; Griffiths et al., 2009) were published between 2010 and 2016. The papers reveal a range of quantitative, qualitative and mixed method designs. A wide variance in the search strategies show a low of one reported database in one study (Househ et al., 2014) to more than 11 reported in several papers (Eysenbach et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2014; Dyson et al., 2016). The number of included papers ranged from a low of 3 (Shaw et al., 2016) to a high of 170 (Sawesi et al., 2016). The average number of included papers was 36.571 in each of the 42 included SRs.

Breakdown of the # of SRs by country of the corresponding authors (n=42 papers)

Ten papers were conducted in Australia [16-25], 9 in the United States [26-34], 8 in the United Kingdom [8,35-41], 3 in Canada [42-44] and Hong Kong [45-47], and one each in Chile [48], Italy [49], Korea [50], Mexico [51], Netherlands [52], New Zealand [53], Portugal [54], Saudi Arabia [55], and Singapore [56]. All 42 papers were written in English and available in full-text.

The included papers were published in a range of journals in public health and medicine such as informatics, general medicine and medical education. Twenty papers (47%) were published in informatics journals; 12 of those (29%) were published by the Journal of Medical Internet Research. Ten papers (24%) were published in general medicine or medical education journals. The remaining papers appeared in specific biomedical journals where the focus of the systematic review seemed appropriate for the journal in question: infectious diseases (n=3), pharmacy (n=2), public health (n=2), and one paper each in journals specializing in nutrition, paediatrics, rehabilitation and microbiology and immunology.

Thematic analysis and categorization

The 42 papers in this review were analyzed using a method as described by Braun and Clarke [14]. The work of Thomas and Harden [57] helped to inform our thematic and narrative synthesis. Thematic analysis is a flexible means of identifying, analyzing, and reporting patterns within data [14]. Data analysis was completed by note-taking on first impressions of reading the papers. Each paper was then analyzed, and themes or categories were noted in relation to study participants, technologies or health conditions. Following the analysis of papers, a hierarchical content analysis was conducted. Themes from the reviews were coded and placed into categories. These were placed into higher order or smaller sub-themes.

According to Thomas and Harden (2008), thematic synthesis consists of three stages: coding of text 'line-by-line', development of 'descriptive themes' and a generation of 'analytical themes' [57]. While the development of descriptive themes is closely linked to the primary studies, the analytical themes represent a stage of interpretation where the reviewers 'go beyond' the primary studies and generate new interpretive constructs, explanations and hypotheses.

Findings from the thematic analysis

The thematic analysis is presented as a conceptual map in Appendix D. The conceptual map reveals the multi-dimensional nature of SM, its most common uses and tools, potential benefits and challenges. All 42 papers were classified into 9 major themes or categories:Uses of social
media. Social media formats. Population groups using SM. Technology and healthcare. Benefits of SM. Limitations (including harms) of SM. Disease types and prevention. Outcome measures. Psychology and emotions. While the nine themes provide insight into the 42 papers, and aid in our categorization, we developed 97 subthemes and categories for further classificatory detail.

Our thematic analysis shows that the general public, patients and health professionals use SM for multiple reasons. In alphabetical order, the following themes emerged: behavioural change-management [21,24,25,31,47,49,53,54], disease prevention and management [39,47,49,53], disease surveillance [27], health education and communication [8,11,22,39,49], online learning [24,28,32,33,37,40,41], online reporting and symptom reporting [25,38,41], outbreak management [27], pharmacy practice and education [16], and professional development [22].

The most common SM types were blogs [28,39,43,52], bulletin boards [20,42,53], discussion boards & forums [20,42,53], Facebook [16,21,22,24,25,27,28,38-40,43,50,52-54], Internet chatrooms & support groups [20], learning management systems (LMS) [46], listservs, mobile sharing apps [25], Skype [43], text-messaging applications, Twitter [21,25,28,38-40,52], videogames and virtual worlds [18,42,56], wikis (including Wikipedia) [16] and YouTube [38,39,43].

Key populations in the thematic analysis were adolescents and teens (young people/youth >18 years old) [8,19,24,29,35,36,43,47,48,54], older (senior) adults (up to 80 years old) [32,45,51], health professionals [18,28,33,37,40] pharmacists [16,37], physicians [28,37,40], students in healthcare [28,37,46] and vulnerable populations [17,48,51].

Several important information technology themes emerged such as the use of mobile apps [25], digital technology [47], information and communication technologies [31,45], mHealth (mobile health) [25], mobile phones [25,41,45,49], social media technologies and social networking [35-38,47,48,51,54], tele-monitoring, video gaming [31], virtual and 3D (three-dimensional) learning environments [18,22,31,37], and Web 2.0 [22].

Recurring themes of benefits were related to increased community support [42,43], greater social connectedness [43,52], health management [8,21,25,27,31,32,41,49,53], health promotion [24,25,39,47,49], Internet support groups [20,32,42], knowledge acquisition [22,40], learning opportunities [28,40] and social interaction [20,51].

Social media were used by patients across health conditions and disease types to manage depression [15,31,41], diabetes [37,52], mental health [15,31,41] and sexual health [14,19,43,50]. Other themes were increased awareness of AIDS and HIV prevention [28,37,43], medications and prescription adherence [51], immunizations and vaccinations [35,45], and obesity and weight management [16,20,21,50]. Other themes included cancer [30], cardiovascular disease [25], influenza [49], travel medicine [39], traumatic brain injury [17], infectious diseases [27], and non-communicable diseases [53].

In papers that examined SM usage by health professionals, the following main themes emerged: medical and pharmacy education [11,23,32,34,45], e-professionalism [11,17,36], and professional development and training [11,51]. The theme of limitations (barriers and/or harms of SM) for health professionals and health students emerged in e-professionalism [16,40], media richness of tools (e.g., the degree to which they provide affordances for sharing, greater online presence and self-disclosure potential) [8,20,53], and problems related to trolling and flaming [43]. The use of SM by patients was connected to a range of negative and positive psychological themes such as depression [20,36,45], emotions [52], risk behaviours [21,27,47,54], loneliness [45,50], mental health [20,36,45], self-harm and self-inflicted injury [43], self-management [25,32], social cognitive [54], social isolation [36,45,51,53] and suicidality [43].

Positive and negative effects of SM in health populations

Positive effects and benefits

SM have been used across a range of populations with both positive and negative effects. One paper in our inclusion set is Eysenbach et al.’s highly-cited paper from 2004, which examined 45 papers from the early period of SM use from 1995 to 2003 [42]. The authors found that the benefits of peer-to-peer (P2P) communities and electronic self-support were difficult to assess with most studies showing ‘no effects’. Some authors acknowledged anecdotal evidence of electronic self-help groups but recommended better evaluation to determine the precise impact [8,36,54].

One large SR in our review synthesized 170 papers; a total of 112 randomized controlled trials, 7 case studies, 19 cohort studies, 15 cross-sectional analyses, and 17 quasi-experimental trials up to 2016 [31]. The authors found that 88.8% (151/170) showed some positive impact of SM on patient behaviours and health outcomes, and 82.9% reported major improvements in patient engagement by using SM platforms [31]. For example, Facebook provided a forum for reporting personal experiences, asking questions, and receiving direct feedback for people living with diabetes [31]. Text messaging enhanced successful engagement and HIV patients used Internet-based interventions to access information and manage health problems [31]. Some patients, in using tele-monitoring, video and game-based interventions, found it useful to communicate with healthcare providers via information technologies [31].

In two well-performed meta-analyses, published in 2014 and 2015 respectively, the use of SM by patients in different age groups was found to result in some self-reported and measurable changes in behaviour [21,54]. Some social networking services (SNS) showed statistically-measurable effects in promoting healthy behaviours [21,54]. In 2015, Laranjo et al. called for better research to be done in health behaviour change theory pointing out the phenomenon of social 'network alteration' where close ties and ‘homophily’ encourage health-behaviour-change diffusion in social networks [54]. Maher et al. reported that 90% of the papers they examined revealed significant improvements in health behaviour change. However, it was unclear whether SNS-based interventions were equally useful for all health behaviours longer term [21].

Several recent SRs published from 2014 to 2016 showed that increased interactions on SM [34,35,41,53] triggered positive changes in managing health problems [8,34,35,42,52,55]. Although the effects were modest, the act of iterative information-sharing (a key activity on SM) provided benefits for patients in improved care [25,32], self-efficacy [20,21,55] and adoption of healthier lifestyles [8,26,35,55]. In public health studies from 2011 to 2015, SM were increasingly used in educating at risk and vulnerable populations [8,19,27,48].

Facebook and Twitter were, from 2011 to 2016, the most preferred SM tools (n=15 papers), followed by blogs (n=4), YouTube (n=3), virtual worlds (n=3), and electronic bulletin boards (n=3). Facebook and Twitter were often chosen by users in meeting others and exchanging information about health concerns [8,20,35], and repeatedly used to access information and expertise [17,24,26,35,36]. There was little evidence statistically that they actually promoted health [35]. Adults aged 18 to 49 make up the largest group using Facebook and Twitter, and officials applied them to target demographic groups for projects in sexual health, health promotion, and in disease screening [21,29,30]. The affordances of Facebook and Twitter (i.e., openness or “publicness”, high potential for or degree of sociality, ease of use) were well-suited to the social networking needs of most users [8].

Every one of the 42 included papers demonstrated some benefit, even the review focussed on deliberate acts of self-harm in SM [43]. Several reviews (n=18) looked at effectiveness or aimed to identify the benefits or “effects” of SM in some way [9,21,24-26,33,35,36,42,45-49,52-54,58]. In three reviews, information-sharing conferred benefits, such as closer social network ties, increased emotional support, and reduced anxieties and stigma [35,36,42]. The sustained effects of SM were not proven; SM were often characterized as having potential rather than proven to be effective [25,35,47,53].

Older (senior) patients were the main study populations in two papers from 2016 [45,51]. From 2013 to 2016, older adults were mentioned as the study population in several papers [8,30,44,45,55]. To assist older patients in coping with social isolation, SM tools were shown to be effective for some seniors. In most cases, SM should be selected with the population in mind where the best platforms have been studied empirically and deployed accordingly [45]. Research on other types of ICTs (e.g., mobile phone–based instant messaging apps) should be conducted to promote understanding of ICT-based social-isolation interventions for older people [45].

In reviews from 2011 to 2016, various diseases and health concerns were seen as the focus of interventions for depression, HIV, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, fitness, weight management and sexual health across all age ranges [19,20,26,30,33,34]. Repeatedly, papers revealed that patients and health consumers were using SM to engage in socially-supportive activity and conversations [20,42]. Selected e-health online social networks, such as PatientsLikeMe and Daily Strength, were mentioned in four papers (8, 48, 52, 54), but their precise benefits and effectiveness were not clearly measured.

In public health, there was growing usage of SM to educate the public about avoiding infectious agents [19,24,49] and to monitor emerging health threats [27]. At least two reviews characterized SM as having benefits in public health and developing policy [8,48].

Positive feedback (if not clear evidence) was provided in some studies where SM was used in online and mobile learning [28,37,40]. Identified benefits of using mobile-enabled SM in health education were related to the acquisition of new skills and knowledge for users on-the-go [28,40]. Health professionals used SM to engage in mobile and socially-distributed learning and peer-to-peer interaction [28,40,46]. Use of Facebook and Twitter was viewed favourably and rarely associated with harmful effects in e-professionalism or social relationships [16,28,52]. Benetoli et al. showed that pharmacists accessed Facebook many times a day, using mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets), but their use was restricted during work time in community pharmacies [16]. Networking with colleagues on Facebook seemed to break feelings of isolation experienced by some pharmacists, especially those in rural areas [16]. Participants reported that some dispensaries blocked Facebook [16]. The use of Facebook and Twitter in academic health was more open and focused on the lack of evidence of SM’s positive or negative effects; in fact, they were shown to be equally or more effective than other platforms [37]. Commonly-cited challenges for healthcare workers using their mobiles were technical glitches (43%), variable learner participation (43%), and privacy/security concerns (29%) [28].

Overall, the use of SM by health professionals was very positive with good levels of learner satisfaction [22,40]. SM resulted in increases in learner satisfaction and positive experiences for students, especially in problem-based learning [46]. One review found positive effects from the adoption of educational technologies, and listed 8 roles that tools such as digital learning objects, interactive whiteboards, plasma screens and learning management systems play in developing skills [46]. More training in using educational technologies was also mentioned [16,28,40,46].

Problematic or negative effects of SM

Some problematic or harmful effects of SM were seen. As social networks take larger roles in our personal and professional lives, problematic effects are increasingly likely to emerge. Some papers showed that SM has a role in increasing risky behaviours (displayed online which could be taken offline) as well as a diminished sense of well-being [8,35,45,50,52]. Balatasoukas et al. said that negative emotions expressed on SM are contagious, thereby networking the problematic behaviours [35]. The idea of contagion was why some health information shared in social networks seems to be of poor quality, a phenomenon that affects the reliability of information as it is shared ‘virally’. In some cases, SM were responsible for spreading incorrect medical advice, false claims, misinformation and even fake news [8,9,30].

Much debate and polarization exist about the impact of SM on the health and mental well-being of patients [36,52], especially teenagers. Harmful effects include increased exposure to social isolation, depression and cyber-bullying [33]. Other harmful effects in younger people include the triggering of addictive behaviours, with losses in self-efficacy and confidence [50]. Further, some young adults participating in discussion forums and bulletin boards described feeling harassed and aggressively targeted (and “tracked down”) [20,42,53]. The benefits of SM for adolescents include better self-esteem and social capital, safe identity experimentation, and more opportunity for self-disclosure with peers [33]. Facebook provided efficient ways to contact adolescents but significant positive (or negative) effects were not seen from this tracking [23]. One paper stated that adolescents progress to new media quickly, enjoy health anonymity online [33] and create hidden “secret” worlds [23]. Some users seek privacy in matters of sexual health [19,27,48], HIV prevention and testing [47], and in managing their sexual behaviour [24,29].

The barriers and limitations of SM, especially on Facebook and Twitter, may be related to ‘context collapse’, where personal and professional boundaries can overlap undesirably [59]. When SM were used in medical education, the benefits of private social networks and learning management systems were not fully measured [46]. One problem is the failure to identify whether Facebook or Twitter are more or less effective than private platforms (or as supplements in ‘blended’ models). Broad use of SM is inhibited by the tension between openness on the Web and upholding medical privacy and confidentiality norms. Some adverse events were seen but they occurred infrequently confirming for some that SM can be used safely by medical educators (notwithstanding their benefits are hard to prove) [11,17,36]. Twelve limitations of using SM in communication was drawn to help health professionals fully appreciate all the challenges [8].

A few studies published in 2014 and 2015 raised the concern about professional misconduct for health workers and distractions related to SM use [11,17,36]. These concerns inhibit the use of SM generally. More robust research is needed in medical education to understand how tools and platforms can be used in mobile learning especially at a distance. The effects of SM on medical education, recruitment, and professionalism should also be studied further [28,37].

SM may lead to better social interactions for some, but recurring concerns were expressed about harms. For example, concerns about cyberbullying and its effects on the well-being of young adults were commonly expressed [36]. SM had positive effects on health provider-patient relationships, but some users express discomfort with communicating via social networks [52]. In one paper, extreme uses of SM resulted in trolling (deliberate provocation of others) and flaming (mocking or encouraging deliberate self-harm). In the study of detrimental effects of SM by young people, self-harm extended to increased suicidality [42]. The authors, however, pointed to a lack of evidence linking SM use and harmful behaviours, and reminded health providers to promote general Internet safety practices to avoid adverse events [42].

Limitations

Evidence is inconclusive

In this review, the evidence was revealed to be inconclusive with respect to benefits or harms. Not surprisingly, the quality of the primary research is weak. Further, the tools and platforms revealed only moderate positive and negative effects. From the evidence, little is known about the sustainability or long-term effects of these technologies. The speed at which SM tools, platforms, mobile devices and user practices change, for different populations, present difficulties for e-health researchers. Constant variation and change make it difficult to measure effects, what works and how, and this complicates any effort to compare findings in the research.

There were methodological flaws in the primary research cited in the papers we examined. For example, many papers did not pool their findings by study type or time period. Generally, there was confusion about SM terminologies, categories and definitions. Researchers using terms such as ‘information and communication technologies’, ‘digital tools’ and ‘online learning platforms’ are encouraged to define them and use them with more precision. Some papers did not understand the defining characteristics of SM technologies and platforms and confused them with interactive websites.

In a majority of papers (n=20), conflicting results and conclusions meant that the findings were not generalizable. Findings that examined SM use in resource-rich countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom and Australia, could not be compared to poorer countries; the reverse was also true. For example, some developing countries periodically block their citizens from using Facebook and Twitter making them unreliable platforms to use in public health. Further, SM must be examined in the ecological contexts of health promotion and evidence-based decision-making; some interventions thought to be portable from one socio-economic or cultural setting or context to another were clearly not. In many SRs, SM were used as a subset of other e-health interventions making it difficult to assess specific tools and platforms.

Reflections on the study methodology

There are inherent weaknesses in the methodology we used. For our own results, we had to rely on the critical appraisal of individual studies, as well as on the interpretation of results, in each paper we examined. Further, the SRs we examined differed considerably in their study populations, interventions, comparisons and outcomes, sometimes with contradictory findings and results. Some SRs did not do a good job of specifying inclusion criteria, and literature searches were not routinely performed to high standards. As a whole, the reviews were heterogeneous; thus sensitivity, subgroup, or meta-analyses could not be performed. Due to poor quality, it was difficult to extrapolate overall themes and conclusions from dissimilar studies with any confidence. Pooling older studies (n=2 from 2004 and 2009) with newer ones (n=40 from 2010 to 2016) presented difficulties in longitudinal cross-comparisons as settings and contexts changed.

Future research

Social technologies and the mobile devices used to access them (including device penetration, capabilities, user communities, digital skills of user groups) are rapidly changing. E-health researchers need more responsive approaches to evaluation that address these rapid changes. By the time an evaluation is published, the results may not apply to the current version of the tool under investigation (the latest version can often be different from the one being evaluated).

In 2015, Vandelanotte et al. said that most research examining the value of social networks has been disappointing [58]. To demonstrate the effective uses of SM in healthcare, more creative and experimental study designs will be required. Future research will have to account for the speed of change as many studies revealed that some SM tools were no longer available.

Repeatedly, we felt that the primary research was hampered by heterogeneity of interventions, and other methodological limitations. Moreover, there seems to be a need to conduct better studies, with appropriate controls, where the focus is on patients. An important emerging issue is the lack of evidence and understanding of the exponential costs of using SM. While many tools are free to use, their implementation in healthcare is not cost-neutral. Cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment studies are needed to demonstrate value in the long term. Demonstrated economic benefits could guide future practices in the field.

To inform future research, studies should adopt better and more consistent definitions of social media. Definitions should account for more recent tools (e.g., Instagram, SnapChat, WhatsApp, WeChat, etc.), and the emergence of fraudulent research, misinformation and fake news. SNSs such as WhatsApp and Facebook have been implicated in identity theft, spreading spam, and creating trust in false information and fake treatments [60,61].

Our paper is already out of date. Many new SRs have been published recently. However, these papers will now be part of a living systematic review [62]. See our wiki http://hlwiki.slais.ubc.ca/index.php/Effective_uses_of_social_media_in_healthcare:_a_living_systematic_review_of_reviews where updates will be posted and papers that satisfy our inclusion criteria will be included with a brief thematic categorization.

Conclusions

SM have been widely-studied in health and medicine from 2003 to 2017 but evidence of their effectiveness is inconclusive. The positive, measurable effect of SM in the delivery of health services and programmes is lacking and the quality of papers is modest. However, our SR provides a starting point for future research and in identifying effective uses of social media. Future investigations of SM effects should focus on best practices, patient-oriented research, and the costs-benefit of using certain tools or platforms in varying healthcare settings.

Our paper suggests that SM research has entered a mobile-intensive period where patients and health professionals seek better ways to conduct their online activities and lifelong learning. Future research should identify not just how patients use SM in their daily lives but seek to understand their positive and negative effects. Researchers must examine the circumstances that lead to adoption of SM in specific ecologies and populations and undertake cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment studies. Better research designs in e-health are strongly needed given the increased prominence and potential value of SM in 21st c. healthcare.
