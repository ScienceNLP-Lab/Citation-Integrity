T8	Span 0 277	The DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium recently published the largest T2D GWAS meta-analysis to date (DIAGRAMv3), identifying many additional common variants associated with T2D and bringing the total number of independent T2D loci to 65 (12).

T10	Span 365 558	DIAGRAMv3 also modeled the theoretical existence of 488 additional common variants likely associated with T2D on the arrays used in their analyses but with effect sizes too small for detection.
