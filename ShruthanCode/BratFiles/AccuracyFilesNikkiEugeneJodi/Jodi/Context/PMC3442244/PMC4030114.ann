T8	Span 2602 2879	The DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium recently published the largest T2D GWAS meta-analysis to date (DIAGRAMv3), identifying many additional common variants associated with T2D and bringing the total number of independent T2D loci to 65 (12).
T9	Span 2880 2966	Together, these loci explained ∼5.7% of the variance in genetic susceptibility to T2D.
T10	Span 2967 3160	DIAGRAMv3 also modeled the theoretical existence of 488 additional common variants likely associated with T2D on the arrays used in their analyses but with effect sizes too small for detection.
T11	Span 3161 3289	These hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) would increase the proportion of explained T2D susceptibility to 10.7%.
T12	Span 3290 3474	Subsequent models using genome-wide complex trait analysis suggested that 63% of T2D susceptibility might be attributable to common genetic variation in the full set of GWAS SNPs (12).

T14	Span 10986 11362	We identified 20 predominantly β-cell–associated SNPs by 1) their significant effect on homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-β (β < –0.008; P < 0.05) in the most recent Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) (12) and/or 2) a significant effect (P < 0.05) on one of the β-cell function indices (18): insulinogenic index or acute insulin response.
