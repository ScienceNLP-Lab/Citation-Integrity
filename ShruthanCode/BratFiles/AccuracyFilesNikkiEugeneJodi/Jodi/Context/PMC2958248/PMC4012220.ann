T8	Span 2333 2472	Since only a few copies of HIV DNA integrate, the bulk of HIV DNA remains in the cytosol unless cleared by host enzymes (Yan et al., 2010).
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T8	
T9	Span 2474 2738	Although abundant, the HIV-encoded cytosolic DNA produced by reverse transcription does not trigger a cell-autonomous interferon (IFN) or inflammatory response in activated CD4 T cells and macrophages, its primary targets (Goldfeld et al., 1991; Yan et al., 2010).
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T9	
T10	Span 2739 2955	HIV achieves immune evasion in these target cells by exploiting the host DNase TREX1 (Yan et al., 2010), the most abundant exonuclease in mammalian cell (Hoss et al., 1999; Mazur and Perrino, 1999), to clear its DNA.
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T10	
T11	Span 3126 3477	In the absence of TREX1, HIV infection triggers a robust type I IFN response strictly dependent upon the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized adaptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (Yan et al., 2010).
R4	Context Target:T3 Context:T11	
T12	Span 2956 3061	This action of TREX1 diminishes HIV DNA products in the cytosol below the threshold of immune activation.
T13	Span 3062 3125	This is strikingly demonstrated in Trex1-/- or knockdown cells.
R6	Context Target:T2 Context:T12	
R5	Context Target:T3 Context:T13	
T14	Span 3478 3789	The HIV-stimulated IFN response in Trex1-/- cells can be dampened by reverse transcriptase inhibitor (e.g., nevirapine) but not by integrase inhibitor (e.g., raltegravir), consistent with HIV DNA being the main pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) detected by an innate immune sensor (Yan et al., 2010).
R7	Context Target:T4 Context:T14	
T15	Span 5543 5726	it also exploits several key host factors that are critical for subversion of innate immune responses in target cells (Doitsh et al., 2010, 2014; Manel et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2010)
R8	Context Target:T5 Context:T15	
T16	Span 9181 9308	In cell culture, TREX1 deficiency leads to accumulation of total HIV-1 DNA, but not integrated proviral DNA (Yan et al., 2010).
R9	Context Target:T6 Context:T16	
T17	Span 9917 10136	Consequently, overall HIV-1 replication in which TREX1 expression is suppressed or ablated is reduced compared replication in normal cells, because DNA sensing results in expression of antiviral IFNs (Yan et al., 2010).
