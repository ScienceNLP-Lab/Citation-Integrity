T7	Span 2138 2228	In 2012, Boström et al. [2] reported the finding of an exercise-inducible hormone, irisin.
T8	Span 2229 2406	They showed that irisin mediates increased energy expenditure in mice resulting in improved weight regulation and glucose homeostasis, and suggested a role for it in humans [2].

T9	Span 2777 2898	Boström et al. [2] found irisin to be cleaved from the membrane protein FNDC5 in muscle and released into the circulation

T10	Span 2900 3043	This was found to be under control of the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1 α (PGC-1α)[2].

T11	Span 4110 4322	In accordance with this, the increased energy expenditure and improved glucose homeostasis mediated by irisin in mice occurs in a UCP-1-dependent manner [2], independently of physical activity and dietary habits.

T12	Span 4335 4401	irisin converts white adipose tissue into beige adipose tissue [2]

T13	Span 5158 5395	While FNDC5 expression originally was claimed to increase after acute exercise [2], more recent studies have reported no or only minor increases [26, 28]. So far, few studies have explored the acute effect of strength training on irisin.
