T3	Span 4087 4475	Advances have recently been achieved on identification of several transcriptional factors and coregulators that specifically promote development and acquisition of the BAT-specific gene expression profile, including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), PRDM16, peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) (18–20).

T4	Span 4477 4845	PGC-1α and PRDM16 are transcriptional coactivators involved in the control of energy metabolism, and ectopic expression of PGC-1α and PRDM16 in WAT induces acquisition of BAT features, including expression of mitochondrial and fatty acid oxidation and thermogenic genes to limit weight gain and improve glucose intolerance in response to a high-fat diet (HFD) (20–23).
