T12	Span 3784 3958	Recent advances in the field suggest that breast tumors belonging to the claudin-low and basal-like intrinsic subtypes are particularly enriched in TIC cell signatures [6,7].
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T12	
T13	Span 4487 4774	Hallmarks of these tumors include a high enrichment for a CD44+/CD24-/low TIC signature, a downregulation of cell junction proteins such as cadherins and claudins, an enrichment in mesenchymal markers, high lymphocyte infiltrations, and high phenotypic resistance to chemotherapy [6,11].
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T13	
T14	Span 19174 19237	We also used available microarrays from the UNC337 dataset [6].

T16	Span 29089 29187	High CD44high/CD24- ratios have been associated with the claudin-low breast cancer subtype [6,11].
R5	Context Target:T4 Context:T16	
T17	Span 35316 35513	A hallmark of the claudin-low subtype of breast cancer is the enrichment of mesenchymal markers along with the downregulation of epithelial junction proteins, including E-cadherin and claudins [6].
R6	Context Target:T5 Context:T17	
T18	Span 35963 36157	These upregulated (n = 534) and downregulated (n = 1, 144) gene signatures were examined across the intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancers by using a published cohort of 337 samples [6].
R7	Context Target:T6 Context:T18	
T19	Span 47855 48040	Claudin-low carcinomas were recently identified by Herschkowitz and colleagues [44] and further characterized by using a large database of human breast tumors [6,44] and cell lines [6].

T20	Span 48041 48191	Although claudin-low tumors are relatively rare (representing up to 11% of all breast cancers), they are associated with poor patient survival [6,10].
R10	Context Target:T9 Context:T20	
T21	Span 48192 48322	Claudin-low carcinomas uniquely express low levels of tight and adherent junction genes, including claudins and E-cadherin [6,12].
