T9	Span 19219 19409	To investigate whether any of the significant brain cisSNPs may influence risk of AD, we compared our eGWAS results to the AD risk associations from the large AD GWAS conducted by ADGC [28].
R1	Context Target:T1 Context:T9	
T10	Span 19410 19515	We obtained results of meta-analyses for the ADGC Stage 1+2 cohort (11,840 LOAD vs. 10,931 controls) [28]

T11	Span 20826 20927	ABCA7, identified recently as a novel LOAD risk locus [28], [47], had significant cerebellar cisSNPs.

T12	Span 29076 29366	Despite the enrichment of our samples with tissue from AD subjects and our use of both cerebellar and temporal cortex tissue, we did not identify strong transcript associations for some of the top genes recently implicated in AD risk in large LOAD GWAS studies [28], [39], [40], [47], [48].
R4	Context Target:T4 Context:T12	
T13	Span 30886 30966	we did find associations with cisSNPs for ABCA7, a novel AD risk locus gene [28]

T14	Span 41235 41373	To determine whether any of the cisSNPs significant at q<0.05 influenced risk of AD, we obtained meta-analyses results from the ADGC [28].
