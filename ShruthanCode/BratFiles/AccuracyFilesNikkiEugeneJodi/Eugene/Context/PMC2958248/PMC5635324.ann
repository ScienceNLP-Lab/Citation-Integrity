T4	Span 17250 17455	Some of the earliest evidence that HIV-1 produces a stimulatory DNA PAMP during infection was obtained in human CD4+ T cells and macrophages that had been depleted for the cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 (42).
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T4	
T5	Span 17456 17605	In this study TREX1 was suggested to digest unencapsidated HIV-1 DNA that would otherwise activate a type I IFN response in a STING-dependent manner.
R2	Context Target:T0 Context:T5	
T6	Span 88519 88653	In macrophages and T cells, cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 digests escaped HIV-1 DNA that would otherwise trigger innate DNA sensing (42)
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T6	
T7	Span 88659 88766	In TREX1-depleted cells, escaped HIV-1 DNA is sensed by DNA sensor cyclic GMPâ€“AMP synthase (cGAS) (42, 43).
R4	Context Target:T3 Context:T7	
T8	Span 64637 64843	This stealthy replication is in part dependent on the cytoplasmic exonuclease TREX1, which degrades HIV-1 reverse transcripts that would otherwise be sensed by cGAS leading to a type I IFN response (33, 42)
