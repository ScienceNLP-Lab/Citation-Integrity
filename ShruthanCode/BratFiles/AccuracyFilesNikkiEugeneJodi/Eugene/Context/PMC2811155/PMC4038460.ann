T8	Span 3692 3846	these genes encode components of a mitochondrial quality control system that promotes the selective degradation of defective mitochondria [9], [10], [11].
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T8	
T9	Span 4092 4343	The accumulated PINK1 then recruits the cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which ubiquitinates proteins on the mitochondrial surface, leading to isolation of the defective mitochondria and their eventual degradation in the lysosome [9], [10], [11].
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T9	
T10	Span 10547 10614	PINK1 accumulates in cell culture upon mitochondrial depolarization
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T10	
T11	Span 16782 16902	consistent with previous work demonstrating that PINK1 is rapidly degraded in healthy mitochondria (Fig. 4D) [10], [11].
R4	Context Target:T3 Context:T11	
T12	Span 17901 18083	Previous work has shown that the accumulation of PINK1 on the mitochondrial outer membrane triggers the recruitment of Parkin and the eventual degradation of mitochondria [10], [11].
R5	Context Target:T4 Context:T12	
T13	Span 21648 21756	Previous work has shown that PINK1 protein is normally maintained at low levels in healthy cells [10], [11].
R6	Context Target:T5 Context:T13	
T14	Span 25834 26106	Although previous work indicated that the accumulation of FL-PINK1 on the outer surface of depolarized mitochondria triggers the activation of the PINK1-Parkin pathway [10], [11], it was unclear whether other processed forms of PINK1 could also trigger pathway activation.
R7	Context Target:T6 Context:T14	
T15	Span 26599 26793	However, because FL-PINK1 appears to be the only form of PINK1 that accumulates upon mitochondrial depolarization [10], processed forms of PINK1 may not normally participate in pathway activity.
