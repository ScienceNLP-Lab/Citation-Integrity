T3	Span 18748 19284	When targeted to healthy mitochondria, PINK1 is partially translocated across the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes, cleaved by several enzymes including the matrix-localized mitochondrial-processing peptidase MPP and the inner membrane protease PARL, released back into the cytosol, and rapidly degraded by the proteasome via the N-end rule pathway (Fig. 3 C; Jin et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010b; Deas et al., 2011; Meissner et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2011; Greene et al., 2012; Yamano and Youle, 2013).

T4	Span 19285 19520	In this situation, Parkin is dispersed throughout the cytosol as an inactive form and is not stably associated with mitochondria (Narendra et al., 2008, 2010b; Matsuda et al., 2010; Chaugule et al., 2011; Chew et al., 2011) (Fig. 3 C).

T5	Span 19594 19825	Upon mitochondrial dysfunction such as ΔΨm dissipation, PINK1 is stalled in the outer membrane and anchored on the surface of mitochondria (Kawajiri et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010b; Rakovic et al., 2010).
