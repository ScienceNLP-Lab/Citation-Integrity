T8	Span 2602 2879	The DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium recently published the largest T2D GWAS meta-analysis to date (DIAGRAMv3), identifying many additional common variants associated with T2D and bringing the total number of independent T2D loci to 65 (12).
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T8	
T9	Span 3290 3474	Subsequent models using genome-wide complex trait analysis suggested that 63% of T2D susceptibility might be attributable to common genetic variation in the full set of GWAS SNPs (12).
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T9	
T10	Span 9329 9512	In the present analyses, we updated these GRS  to include as many of the 65 index SNPs or their proxies as were available at the confirmed or newly identified loci from DIAGRAMv3 (12)
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T10	
T11	Span 10986 11229	We identified 20 predominantly β-cell–associated SNPs by 1) their significant effect on homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-β (β < –0.008; P < 0.05) in the most recent Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) (12)
R4	Context Target:T3 Context:T11	
T12	Span 11363 11496	We identified 10 predominantly IR–related SNPs by 1) their significant association with HOMA-IR (P < 0.05) in the MAGIC data (12), 2)
R5	Context Target:T4 Context:T12	
T13	Span 18799 18979	The largest T2D GWAS meta-analysis to date (12) may include all of the common T2D-associated loci of at least modest effect size that can be expected to be specifically identified.
R6	Context Target:T5 Context:T13	
T14	Span 19960 20104	Second, we updated the weight we used for each locus in our GRS  based on the effect sizes from the largest T2D GWAS meta-analysis to date (12).
R7	Context Target:T6 Context:T14	
T15	Span 25973 26066	The DIAGRAMv3 meta-analysis consisted predominantly of populations of European ancestry (12).
