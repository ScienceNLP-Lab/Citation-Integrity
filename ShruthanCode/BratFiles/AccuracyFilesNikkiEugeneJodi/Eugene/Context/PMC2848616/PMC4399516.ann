T8	Span 6301 6529	mTOR, an inhibitor of autophagy, decreases the Aβ clearance of the autophagy/lysosome system which accounts for the clearance of abnormal proteins.20,43 mTOR also modulates the metabolism of APP by regulating β- and γ-secretase.
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T8	
T9	Span 9053 9316	Several research findings point to the notion that a chronic deterioration of the autophagy/lysosome pathway is an important factor in the failure of Aβ clearance from the AD brain, while the autophagy/lysosome system determines the outcome of Aβ in the AD brain.
T10	Span 9417 9548	Accordingly, inhibition of mTOR activity induces autophagy, lessens the aggregates of Aβ, and enhances the process of Aβ clearance.

T11	Span 9328 9416	Additionally, mTOR, inhibitor of autophagy, is closely associated with the levels of Aβ.

T13	Span 19245 19431	The striking similarity is the results from the insulin intervention and the inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin that rescue cognitive impairment and retard Aβ pathology in AD animal models.
R6	Context Target:T5 Context:T13	
T14	Span 22591 22741	Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin retards cognitive deficits and reduces the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau by autophagy enhancement in AD models.
