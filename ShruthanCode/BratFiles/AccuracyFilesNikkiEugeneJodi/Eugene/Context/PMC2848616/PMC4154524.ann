T5	Span 23629 23790	Furthermore, many studies have revealed that the stimulation of autophagy can reduce Aβ accumulation and alleviate memory deficits in transgenic AD mice [45-48].
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T5	
T6	Span 26562 26763	In two independent mouse models of AD, rapamycin, through inhibition of mTOR signaling, rescued cognitive deficits by suppressing extracellular Aβ deposition and intracellular tau accumulation [45,63].
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T6	
T7	Span 26764 27006	Interestingly, this treatment induced autophagy marked by increased expression of Atg 7, Atg5-Atg12, decrease in p62, no modification of LC3 expression and controversial results surrounding LC3-II expression in PDAPP and 3xTg-AD mice [45,46].
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T7	
T8	Span 32309 32455	For LC3, no variation is observed in APPswePS1dE9 mice regardless of age compared to WT mice. Other authors show no modification of LC3-I [45,46].
R4	Context Target:T3 Context:T8	
T9	Span 32922 33098	Other authors showed a decrease of LC3-II in PDAPP mice at the age of eight to nine months although treated for thirteen weeks with rapamycin since the age of four months [45].
