T3	Span 14516 14764	In a more recent large-scale meta-analysis which aimed to finely map the causal SNPs, only two of the 65 T2D susceptibility loci examined had a lead SNP resulting in a missense mutation (PPARG [rs1801282] and KCNJ11 [rs5215]) (Morris et al., 2012).
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T3	
T4	Span 18187 18401	The lead SNP at this locus is within the intron of the KCNQ1 protein-coding gene, yet the lead SNP for a putative secondary association signal is in the exon of an antisense lncRNA (KCNQ1OT1) (Morris et al., 2012).
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T4	
T5	Span 20957 21084	The lead SNP for a putative secondary association signal (rs944801) is located within an intron of ANRIL (Morris et al., 2012).
