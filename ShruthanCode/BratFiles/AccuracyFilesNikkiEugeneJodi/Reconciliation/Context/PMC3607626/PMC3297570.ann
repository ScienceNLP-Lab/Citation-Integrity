T6	Span 6012 6153	This network analysis led to the identification of specific co-expression modules that are differentially expressed in ASD and controls [20].
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T6	
T7	Span 6154 6361	These included a neuronal module that was enriched for genes with low GWAS P-values, suggesting that the differential expression of this module between cases and controls reflects a causal relationship [20].
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T7	
T8	Span 20027 20185	Differences in transcriptome organization between autistic and normal brain have been recently reported, including a neuronal module associated with ASD [20].
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T8	
T9	Span 20186 20456	To study how the enrichment of rare and common variants corresponded to this study, we tested the overlap between the neuronal modules obtained in our study and the neuronal module that was previously shown to be differentially expressed between cases and controls [20].

T10	Span 36090 36278	An adjacency matrix was calculated by raising the correlation matrix by a power of 6 (determined to be optimal for scale free topology in our dataset), and a TOM matrix was generated [20].

T11	Span 39784 39884	The analysis incorporated a previously published method [71], in a manner previously described [20].
