T4	Span 13353 13461	Prediction of the claudin-low subtype was done using the claudin-low predictor developed in Prat et al [27].
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T4	
T5	Span 18180 18507	we used previously published gene lists describing stroma [17,18], breast stem cells [15,19,31], myoepithelial cells [12,14], progenitor cells [14], mesenchymal cells [13], high-risk normal cells [16], epithelial cells from parous women [32], intrinsic genelist [5] and a genelist for prediction of the claudin-low subtype [27]
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T5	
T6	Span 19212 19300	a gene list developed to classify the newly identified claudin-low subtype was used [27]
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T6	
T7	Span 28920 29183	The hypothesis that the cluster 1-samples are enriched for immature cells is further supported by the down-regulation of GATA3 seen in these samples compared to the cluster 2 samples (p = 3.8E-9), a protein that is also down-regulated in claudin-low samples [27].
