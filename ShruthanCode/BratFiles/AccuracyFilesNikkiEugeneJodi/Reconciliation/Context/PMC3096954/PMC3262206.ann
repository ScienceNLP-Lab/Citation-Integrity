T12	Span 3784 3958	Recent advances in the field suggest that breast tumors belonging to the claudin-low and basal-like intrinsic subtypes are particularly enriched in TIC cell signatures [6,7].

T13	Span 4487 4774	Hallmarks of these tumors include a high enrichment for a CD44+/CD24-/low TIC signature, a downregulation of cell junction proteins such as cadherins and claudins, an enrichment in mesenchymal markers, high lymphocyte infiltrations, and high phenotypic resistance to chemotherapy [6,11].

T14	Span 19174 19237	We also used available microarrays from the UNC337 dataset [6].
T15	Span 20217 20509	To estimate the expression of the OTBC signature across the intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer, we calculated the mean expression of both gene lists (that is, up- and downregulated) in the entire median-centered UNC337 dataset (n = 327) by using the subtype calls described in [6].

T16	Span 29089 29187	High CD44high/CD24- ratios have been associated with the claudin-low breast cancer subtype [6,11].
