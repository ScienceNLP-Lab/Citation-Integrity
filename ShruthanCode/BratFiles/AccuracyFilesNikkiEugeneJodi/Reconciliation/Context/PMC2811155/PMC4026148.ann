T7	Span 5650 5875	With both of these genes playing a role in ARJP, previous studies have shown that the proteins for these genes are linked where the pathways connect, which is critical in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function [19].
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T7	
T8	Span 5876 5990	If the mitochondria is damaged and not functioning, the 2 proteins will work together to degrade the mitochondria.
R2	Context Target:T0 Context:T8	
T9	Span 5991 6093	In addition, studies have shown that overexpression can compensate for the loss of PINK1 protein [19].
R3	Context Target:T1 Context:T9	
T10	Span 6094 6271	However, overexpression of PINK1 does not compensate for loss of parkin expression, suggesting that PINK1 has a function that is upstream in the pathway connected to parkin [19]

T11	Span 6274 6394	The mitochondrial DNA within the substantia nigra has a higher mutation rate than in any other region in the brain [19].
R5	Context Target:T3 Context:T11	
T12	Span 6395 6611	This increased amount of damage that occurs to the mtDNA is closely associated with sporadic Parkinsonâ€™s disease, which involves multiple changes in nerve cells, causing a considerable mitochondrial dysfunction [19].
R6	Context Target:T4 Context:T12	
T13	Span 15866 15977	Previous studies have shown that overexpression of PARKIN can compensate for the loss of PINK1 expression [19].

T14	Span 16122 16227	we expect these genes work together in a pathway where they sense mitochondria that are in distress [19].
