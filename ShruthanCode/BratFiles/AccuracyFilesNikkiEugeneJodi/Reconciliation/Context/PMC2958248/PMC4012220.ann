T8	Span 2333 2452	Since only a few copies of HIV DNA integrate, the bulk of HIV DNA remains in the cytosol unless cleared by host enzymes
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T8	
T9	Span 2497 2695	HIV-encoded cytosolic DNA produced by reverse transcription does not trigger a cell-autonomous interferon (IFN) or inflammatory response in activated CD4 T cells and macrophages, its primary targets
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T9	
T10	Span 2739 2823	HIV achieves immune evasion in these target cells by exploiting the host DNase TREX1
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T10	
T11	Span 2938 2955	to clear its DNA.
R4	Context Target:T2 Context:T11	
T12	Span 3126 3457	In the absence of TREX1, HIV infection triggers a robust type I IFN response strictly dependent upon the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized adaptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)
R5	Context Target:T3 Context:T12	
T14	Span 2956 3061	This action of TREX1 diminishes HIV DNA products in the cytosol below the threshold of immune activation.
R7	Context Target:T2 Context:T14	
T15	Span 3062 3125	This is strikingly demonstrated in Trex1-/- or knockdown cells.
R8	Context Target:T2 Context:T15	
T16	Span 5543 5660	it also exploits several key host factors that are critical for subversion of innate immune responses in target cells
R9	Context Target:T5 Context:T16	
T17	Span 9181 9288	In cell culture, TREX1 deficiency leads to accumulation of total HIV-1 DNA, but not integrated proviral DNA
T18	Span 9917 10116	Consequently, overall HIV-1 replication in which TREX1 expression is suppressed or ablated is reduced compared replication in normal cells, because DNA sensing results in expression of antiviral IFNs
R11	Context Target:T7 Context:T18	
T19	Span 3478 3769	The HIV-stimulated IFN response in Trex1-/- cells can be dampened by reverse transcriptase inhibitor (e.g., nevirapine) but not by integrase inhibitor (e.g., raltegravir), consistent with HIV DNA being the main pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) detected by an innate immune sensor
