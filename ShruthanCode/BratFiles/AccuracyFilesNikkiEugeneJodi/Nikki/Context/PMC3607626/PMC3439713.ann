T4	Span 3818 4053	These data and families also overlap with those reported by Voineagu et al.[13], who, included in their expression profiling study, used the AGRE data to perform an analysis searching for evidence of a genetic enrichment of immune loci
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T4	
T5	Span 6183 6483	The lack of an enrichment of significant associations in immune genes corroborates the findings by Voineagu et al.[13], who used a complimentary approach to test for evidence of a genetic component for the up-regulation of immune response genes in the autistic brain using the same AGRE genotype data
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T5	
T6	Span 10023 10226	A lack of enrichment of genetic associations in immune-related genes has recently been reported [13] in the same dataset we used, and this conclusion is supported here using another statistical approach.
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T6	
T7	Span 10227 10489	The associations we uncovered in immune-related genes and the observed dysregulation of immune genes in ASD [13] suggest that variation in a limited number of immune-function genes may be responsible for observed up-regulation of their immune downstream targets.
