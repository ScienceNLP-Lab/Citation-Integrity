T10	Span 4576 4889	In studies combining both young and adult autistic brain tissue, transcript and protein expression patterns suggest that cortical patterning, synaptic [20], apoptotic [21], immune [20], [22], and inflammatory [23] aberrances in addition to dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems [24] may be involved in autism.

T11	Span 18686 18839	We compared genes showing a main effect of diagnosis in the present study with differentially expressed genes implicated recently by Voineagu et al. [20]
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T11	
T12	Span 29426 29659	While large sample in vivo studies, such as Pinto et al. [26], have identified potential functional genomic abnormalities in autism, biological validation requires postmortem studies, such as the present one and Voineagu et al. [20].
R4	Context Target:T3 Context:T12	
T13	Span 29660 29846	The comparison of findings between the present study and Voineagu et al. [20] demonstrates a consistent overlap involving several pathways including repair- and immune-related processes.
R5	Context Target:T4 Context:T13	
T14	Span 30435 30618	The differences in the results between our study and Voineagu et al. [20] may be due to genetic heterogeneity, different criteria for sample selection and age and gender distribution.
R6	Context Target:T5 Context:T14	
T15	Span 30619 30856	For example, although our studies assayed a similar number of postmortem cases, our sample consisted of all male autistic and control cases, while that of Voineagu et al. [20] consisted of 36% female autistic and 6% female control cases.
R7	Context Target:T6 Context:T15	
T16	Span 30857 31062	Also, to identify gene expression abnormalities in the young autistic brain, we compared expression in the young autistic brain to the young control brain, while Voineagu et al. [20] lacked young controls.
R8	Context Target:T7 Context:T16	
T17	Span 31063 31191	Thus, some effects that we observed may not have been identified in Voineagu et al. [20] because of differences in study design.
R9	Context Target:T8 Context:T17	
T18	Span 38926 39167	Unique ProbeIDs of differentially expressed in the ‘initial’ dataset from Voineagu et al. [20] (file = ‘nature10110-s3.xls’) were compared with the differential expression gene list in the present study comparing all autism and control cases
