T3	Span 6196 6366	To date, a number of studies have investigated gene expression in ASD (for review see [29]), with three examining ASD brain tissue on a genome-wide scale [30], [31], [32]

T4	Span 21585 21744	Lastly, we were interested in considering our findings in the context of the major three published transcriptomics studies on ASD brain tissue [30], [31], [32]

T5	Span 27210 27725	The most comprehensive transcriptomics study of ASD post-mortem brain to date (Voineagu et al) concludes that one of two significant co-expression networks is involved in immune function [32]. While our results are only a first step in linking common molecular interaction pathways to the underlying genetic heterogeneity of ASD, they provide integrated genomic evidence, which is supported by these transcriptomics, cell, and tissue level studies that further investigation into cytokine signaling in ASD is needed
