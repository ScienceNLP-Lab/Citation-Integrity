T5	Span 2584 2799	A recent whole genome transcriptomic analysis of autism brain suggested candidate pathways in immune regulation and alternative splicing regulation in the temporal cortex, frontal cortex, and cerebellar vermis [13].
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T5	
T6	Span 18166 18409	The differences in the results between our study and other whole genome transcriptomic analyses of autistic brain [13], [28] may be due to etiological heterogeneity together with the use of different criteria for sample selection in each study
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T6	
T7	Span 20658 20863	Numerous genes of brain development and function have been associated with the pathophysiology of autism with varying levels of evidence; the specific genes that are implicated vary across studies [5]â€“[13]
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T7	
T8	Span 21482 21867	Eight of these genes have some evidence in support of an association with autism (http://autismkb.cbi.pku.edu.cn/) [32], two of which (SYN1, PTS) met thresholds for a high level of evidence [32], and concordant changes in the differential expression in autism vs control were found for three of the genes (GPR56, HSPB1, BEX5) between this study and the work of others [13], [28], [33].
R4	Context Target:T3 Context:T8	
T9	Span 22370 22566	he top 300 differentially expressed probes were used to generate a non-redundant gene list and compared with two published differentially expressed autism gene lists in brain [13], [28] (Table S6)
