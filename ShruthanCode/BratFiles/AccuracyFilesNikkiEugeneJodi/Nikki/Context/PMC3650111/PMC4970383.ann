T3	Span 72675 72843	n the liver, TMA is oxidized into trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) (499), a small molecule strongly associated with promoting inflammatory-based atherosclerosis (500, 501)

T4	Span 72845 73141	Most of the bacteria that express genes encoding for TMA lyases are found in three of the four major phyla of the human gut microbiome (502). In apoliprotein E-deficient mice fed a diet with  -carnitine, the promotion of atherosclerosis was also mediated by a microbiota-dependent mechanism (501)
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T4	
T5	Span 73144 73376	While higher plasma levels of  -carnitine, in association with TMAO, are positively correlated with cardiovascular events in humans, intriguingly, omnivores produce more TMAO from dietary  -carnitine than vegans or vegetarians (501)
