T8	Span 2500 2691	Claudin-low tumors were identified in 2007 and are characterized by low levels of claudins 3, 4 and 7, as well as other tight junction proteins (Herschkowitz et al., 2007; Prat et al., 2010).
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T8	
T9	Span 2942 3055	Claudin-low subtypes have been reported to most closely resemble mammary epithelial stem cells (Prat et al., 2010
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T9	
T10	Span 13014 13318	Similarly, using the claudin-low predictor described in Prat et al. (2010), 8/9 RST samples had a gene expression pattern consistent with a claudin-low genotype. Genes highly expressed in the claudin-low gene signature are indicated by red bars on the left-hand side of the expression profile (Figure 7b)

T11	Span 18871 19122	In addition, qRT–PCR confirmed the low levels of claudins 3, 4 and 7 in the RST samples, and the RST samples were identified as claudin-low tumors using claudin-low gene identifier sets established by Herschkowitz et al. (2007) and Prat et al. (2010).

T12	Span 19460 19648	The prevalence of claudin-low tumors is reported to be 7–14%, and claudin-low tumors have a prognosis similar to luminal B, HER2-enriched and basal-like breast cancers (Prat et al., 2010).
