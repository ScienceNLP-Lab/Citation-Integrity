T12	Span 3784 3957	Recent advances in the field suggest that breast tumors belonging to the claudin-low and basal-like intrinsic subtypes are particularly enriched in TIC cell signatures [6,7]
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T12	
T13	Span 4487 4773	Hallmarks of these tumors include a high enrichment for a CD44+/CD24-/low TIC signature, a downregulation of cell junction proteins such as cadherins and claudins, an enrichment in mesenchymal markers, high lymphocyte infiltrations, and high phenotypic resistance to chemotherapy [6,11]
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T13	
T14	Span 19174 19236	We also used available microarrays from the UNC337 dataset [6]
T15	Span 20327 20509	calculated the mean expression of both gene lists (that is, up- and downregulated) in the entire median-centered UNC337 dataset (n = 327) by using the subtype calls described in [6].
T16	Span 29089 29187	High CD44high/CD24- ratios have been associated with the claudin-low breast cancer subtype [6,11].
T17	Span 35316 35513	A hallmark of the claudin-low subtype of breast cancer is the enrichment of mesenchymal markers along with the downregulation of epithelial junction proteins, including E-cadherin and claudins [6].
T18	Span 35963 36155	These upregulated (n = 534) and downregulated (n = 1, 144) gene signatures were examined across the intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancers by using a published cohort of 337 samples [6
T19	Span 47855 48040	Claudin-low carcinomas were recently identified by Herschkowitz and colleagues [44] and further characterized by using a large database of human breast tumors [6,44] and cell lines [6].
T21	Span 48041 48190	Although claudin-low tumors are relatively rare (representing up to 11% of all breast cancers), they are associated with poor patient survival [6,10]
R5	Context Target:T9 Context:T21	
T22	Span 48192 48321	Claudin-low carcinomas uniquely express low levels of tight and adherent junction genes, including claudins and E-cadherin [6,12]
R6	Context Target:T10 Context:T22	
T23	Span 66907 67263	Box-and-whisker plot for the mean expression of the upregulated (534 genes) and downregulated (1, 144 genes) gene signatures (Tables S4 and S5 in Additional files 7 and 8, respectively) in OTBCs compared with the parental cell lines across the intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer by using the published breast cancer patient database (UNC337) [6]
