T4	Span 3569 3812	Another mammary carcinoma subtype that has recently been delineated, termed claudin-low, exhibits high expression of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as SNAI1 and TWIST1, and cancer stem cell-like features [4,5].

T5	Span 3813 4053	Compared with the luminal, HER2-enriched and basal-like subtypes, claudin-low tumors exhibit lower expression of ER, progesterone receptor (PR), HER2 and GATA3 and higher expression of mesenchymal, cell migration and angiogenesis genes [4].
T6	Span 4054 4218	Clinicopathological analyses also revealed that claudin-low tumors have poorer prognosis and may not be managed effectively with existing chemotherapy regimens [4].
T7	Span 5163 5301	Increased expression of TWIST1 is observed in various human cancers [5,14,15] including ER-negative and claudin-low mammary carcinoma [4].
