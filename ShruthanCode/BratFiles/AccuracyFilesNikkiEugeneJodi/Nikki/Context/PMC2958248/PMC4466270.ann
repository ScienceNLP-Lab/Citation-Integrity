T3	Span 4956 5186	However, recent discoveries have shown that human conventional DCs (cDC) are generally capable of generating IFN-I responses to HIV-1, but HIV-1 seems to be able to escape from such cell-intrinsic immunity in most patients [16â€“18]

T4	Span 6006 6281	In addition to SAMHD1, cell-intrinsic immune responses in DCs are inhibited by the host protein TREX1, a host exonuclease that degrades HIV-1 reverse transcripts, which otherwise trigger microbial DNA sensors, leading to cell-intrinsic secretion of type I interferons [18,29]

T5	Span 15500 15657;15713 15748	To investigate this, we first analyzed the expression of SAMHD1 and TREX1 in cDCs after exposure to HIV-1; these host factors can affect HIV-1 RT products by enhancing their degradation [18,29]
