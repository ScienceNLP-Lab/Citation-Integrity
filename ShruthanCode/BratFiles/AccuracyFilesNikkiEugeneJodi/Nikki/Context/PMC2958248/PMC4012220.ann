T8	Span 2333 2472	Since only a few copies of HIV DNA integrate, the bulk of HIV DNA remains in the cytosol unless cleared by host enzymes (Yan et al., 2010).
T9	Span 2739 2841	HIV achieves immune evasion in these target cells by exploiting the host DNase TREX1 (Yan et al., 2010
T10	Span 2474 2736	Although abundant, the HIV-encoded cytosolic DNA produced by reverse transcription does not trigger a cell-autonomous interferon (IFN) or inflammatory response in activated CD4 T cells and macrophages, its primary targets (Goldfeld et al., 1991; Yan et al., 2010
T11	Span 3126 3271;3395 3476	In the absence of TREX1, HIV infection triggers a robust type I IFN response strictly dependent upon the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, including the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (Yan et al., 2010)

T12	Span 3478 3788	The HIV-stimulated IFN response in Trex1-/- cells can be dampened by reverse transcriptase inhibitor (e.g., nevirapine) but not by integrase inhibitor (e.g., raltegravir), consistent with HIV DNA being the main pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) detected by an innate immune sensor (Yan et al., 2010)

T13	Span 5326 5407;5543 5726	Indeed, these findings have engendered a new paradigm for HIV-host interactions â€“ it also exploits several key host factors that are critical for subversion of innate immune responses in target cells (Doitsh et al., 2010, 2014; Manel et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2010)
R5	Context Target:T5 Context:T13	
T14	Span 9181 9308	In cell culture, TREX1 deficiency leads to accumulation of total HIV-1 DNA, but not integrated proviral DNA (Yan et al., 2010).
T15	Span 9917 10135	Consequently, overall HIV-1 replication in which TREX1 expression is suppressed or ablated is reduced compared replication in normal cells, because DNA sensing results in expression of antiviral IFNs (Yan et al., 2010)
