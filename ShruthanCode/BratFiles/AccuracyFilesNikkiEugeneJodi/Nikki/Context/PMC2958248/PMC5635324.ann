T4	Span 17250 17454	Some of the earliest evidence that HIV-1 produces a stimulatory DNA PAMP during infection was obtained in human CD4+ T cells and macrophages that had been depleted for the cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 (42)
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T4	
T5	Span 64637 64843	This stealthy replication is in part dependent on the cytoplasmic exonuclease TREX1, which degrades HIV-1 reverse transcripts that would otherwise be sensed by cGAS leading to a type I IFN response (33, 42)
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T5	
T6	Span 88515 88653	(3) In macrophages and T cells, cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 digests escaped HIV-1 DNA that would otherwise trigger innate DNA sensing (42)
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T6	
T7	Span 88655 88765	(4) In TREX1-depleted cells, escaped HIV-1 DNA is sensed by DNA sensor cyclic GMPâ€“AMP synthase (cGAS) (42, 43)
R4	Context Target:T3 Context:T7
