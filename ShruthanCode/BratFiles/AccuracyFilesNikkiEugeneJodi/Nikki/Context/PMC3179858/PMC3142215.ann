T9	Span 3890 4068	By contrast, Hrecka and colleagues identified SAMHD1 from HEK 293T cells expressing tagged Vpx in a proteomic screen using multidimensional protein identification technology [10]

T11	Span 4070 4276	They demonstrated that Vpx relieves the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages by mediating proteasome-dependent degradation of SAMHD1 through the CUL4A/DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase [10]
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T11	
T10	Span 4278 4479	Both studies confirmed that Vpx interacts with SAMHD1 and induces proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1 in THP-1 cells or macrophages, which can be restored by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor [9,10].

T13	Span 4669 5074	Indeed, Laguette et al. showed that over-expression of a HD domain mutant SAMHD1 in U937 cells fails to restrict HIV-1, suggesting that the phosphodiesterase activity of the HD domain is important for the restriction function of SAMHD1. Further analysis revealed that SAMHD1 blocks HIV-1 reverse transcription, as silencing SAMHD1 in THP-1 cells [9] and macrophages [10] increases the levels of viral DNA.

T14	Span 5076 5213	ogether, these studies suggested that SAMHD1 is the myeloid-cell specific HIV-1 restriction factor counteracted by Vpx [9,10] (Figure 1).
R6	Context Target:T4 Context:T14	
T16	Span 7208 7439	These restriction factors function across many different cell types, whereas SAMHD1 appears to be specific to the myeloid-lineage cells. It might be possible that SAMHD1 acts in concert with another myeloid-specific co-factor [10].
R7	Context Target:T5 Context:T16	
T12	Span 8241 8354	SAMHD1-mediated HIV-1 restriction has so far been analyzed only in monocyte-derived DCs [9] and macrophages [10],
