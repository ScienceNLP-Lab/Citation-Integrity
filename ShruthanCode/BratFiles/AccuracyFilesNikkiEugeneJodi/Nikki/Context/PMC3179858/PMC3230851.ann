T2	Span 40931 41161	Recent studies have identified a host SAM-domain HD-domain containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) as a target for Vpx-mediated proteosomal degradation, which overcomes a post-entry block to reverse transcription in myeloid cells [158,159].

T3	Span 41162 41397	SAMHD1 [158], like the exonuclease TREX1 [160] may be responsible for innate sensing of viral DNA, and viral targeting of SAMHD1 may possibly contribute to viral innate immune evasion, although this has not been specifically addressed.
