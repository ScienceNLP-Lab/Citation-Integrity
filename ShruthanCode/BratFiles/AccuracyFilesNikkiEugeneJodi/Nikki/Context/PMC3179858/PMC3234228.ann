T6	Span 3801 4028	Two recent publications identified Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) Domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) as the Vpx-sensitive restriction factor that inhibits HIV-1 infection of macrophages and dendritic cells [19], [20]
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T6	
T7	Span 4998 5291	In this report, in addition to confirming independently the findings by Laguette et al. and Hrecka et al. [19], [20], we provide further evidence for the role of SAMHD1 as interferon-induced factor restricting HIV-1 replication in monocytes, the progenitors of macrophages and dendritic cells.
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T7	
T8	Span 7332 7597	Our findings are in agreement with the recent reports of Laguette et al. [20] and Hrecka et al. [19] that identified SAMHD1 as a Vpx  and Vpx  interacting protein. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Vpx targets SAMHD1 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T8	
T9	Span 9173 9380	We conclude that monocytes express SAMHD1 as an interferon-inducible factor (Figure 2E) that is degraded upon Vpx-supported HIV-1 infection confirming the results in dendritic cells [20] and macrophages [19]
R4	Context Target:T3 Context:T9	
T10	Span 15349 15524	n this study, we determine the role of SAMHD1 as a HIV-1 restriction factor in human monocytes confirming and extending the findings observed in other myeloid cells [19], [20]
R5	Context Target:T4 Context:T10	
T11	Span 15830 15966	Moreover, we confirm the effect of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 on the reversibility of Vpx-mediated degradation of SAMHD1 [19], [20].
