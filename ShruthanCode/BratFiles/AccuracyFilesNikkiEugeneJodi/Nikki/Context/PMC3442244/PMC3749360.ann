T3	Span 2245 2536	Of these SNPs, 66,000 were selected for efficient replication of top signals across multiple traits, with the hope that when tested in sufficiently large samples they might exceed genome-wide statistical significance (9,10); 120,000 other SNPs were included for the purposes of fine-mapping.

T4	Span 4051 4291	Stool chymotrypsin activity was reduced after DPP-4 treatment in TT homozygotes, but not in G-allele carriers. Interestingly, the G allele had been previously associated with increased risk of type 1 diabetes (11) but lower risk of T2D (10)

T5	Span 10396 10488	Increased incretin sensitivity improves Î²-cell function (13), thereby lowering T2D risk (10)
