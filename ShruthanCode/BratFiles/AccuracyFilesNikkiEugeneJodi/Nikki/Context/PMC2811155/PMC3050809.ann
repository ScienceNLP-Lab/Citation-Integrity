T5	Span 13725 13998	However, only recently, several studies demonstrated that the various observed mitochondrial phenotypes can be ascribed to one common molecular cause: Apparently, a deficit in mitophagy leads to accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in the cell [14], [15], [16], [17].
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T5	
T6	Span 14488 14671	Several studies reported that mitochondrial stress, such as exposure to membrane potential inhibitors, initiates the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway [14], [15], [16], [17], [20], [28].
T7	Span 16536 16715	Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the “increased” mfn levels in pink1 or parkin knockdown flies may reflect an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis in these mutants [17]
