T7	Span 5650 5874	With both of these genes playing a role in ARJP, previous studies have shown that the proteins for these genes are linked where the pathways connect, which is critical in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function [19]

T8	Span 5991 6092	In addition, studies have shown that overexpression can compensate for the loss of PINK1 protein [19]
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T8	
T9	Span 6094 6271	However, overexpression of PINK1 does not compensate for loss of parkin expression, suggesting that PINK1 has a function that is upstream in the pathway connected to parkin [19]

T10	Span 6274 6393	The mitochondrial DNA within the substantia nigra has a higher mutation rate than in any other region in the brain [19]

R5	Context Target:T4 Context:T11	
T12	Span 15866 15976	Previous studies have shown that overexpression of PARKIN can compensate for the loss of PINK1 expression [19]

T13	Span 15978 16227	Therefore, our results of the PARK2 being up-regulated, and the PINK1 gene being down-regulated are preliminary and subject to revision because we expect these genes work together in a pathway where they sense mitochondria that are in distress [19].
