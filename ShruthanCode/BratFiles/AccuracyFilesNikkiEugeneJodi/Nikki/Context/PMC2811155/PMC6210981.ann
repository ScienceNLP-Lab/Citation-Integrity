T3	Span 16953 17128	While PINK build up is the precursor of mitophagy as a quality control process, PARKIN assumes a cleansing role by removing defective mitochondria via autophagy [51,52,56,91].

T4	Span 19277 19557	In ROS-driven processes, PARKIN translocates to mitochondria [109] of primary neurons; by contrast, it translocates to the uncoupled mitochondria of tumor cell lines [110], and it participates in the clearance of damaged mitochondria under PINK1’s influence [51,54,56,91,111,112].

T5	Span 26777 26991	The majority of the work done so far has been related to PINK’s role in mitochondrial function in PD however, many of the experiments in those studies were carried out in cancer cell lines [54,56,67,91,110,165,166]
