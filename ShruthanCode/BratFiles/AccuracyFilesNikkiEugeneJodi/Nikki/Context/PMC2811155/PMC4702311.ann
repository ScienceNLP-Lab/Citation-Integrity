T5	Span 6468 6618	PINK1 protein levels are virtually undetectable under normal conditions, thus arguing against a function of PINK1 in healthy mitochondria [30, 34, 35]
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T5	
T6	Span 8771 9001	Increasing evidence supports that mitochondrial dysfunction-triggered PINK1 localization on the OMM serves as a damage-sensing, quality-control mechanism to mark damaged mitochondria for clearance by mitophagy [29, 35, 44, 49, 50]
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T6	
T7	Span 11926 12103	Subsequent studies in mammalian cells showed that PINK1 is required for recruiting parkin from the cytosol to depolarized mitochondria to promote mitophagy [35, 37, 50, 67, 68].
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T7	
T8	Span 12502 12626	Mitochondrial dysfunction triggers PINK1 localization and activation on the OMM of damaged mitochondria [29, 35, 44, 49, 50]
R4	Context Target:T3 Context:T8	
T9	Span 15971 16242	Furthermore, a number of PD-linked mutations found in the parkin E3 ligase domain, such as parkin T240R and G430D mutations, are able to disrupt the E3 ligase activity of parkin for ubiquitinating its substrates and the ability of parkin to promote mitophagy [35, 50, 68]
