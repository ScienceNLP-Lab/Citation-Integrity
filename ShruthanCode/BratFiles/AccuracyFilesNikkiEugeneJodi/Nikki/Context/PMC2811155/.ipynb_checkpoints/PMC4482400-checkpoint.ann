T3	Span 2872 3066	Parkin is localized to the cytosol under baseline conditions, but rapidly translocates to damaged mitochondria via a mechanism that is thought to involve the serine/threonine kinase PINK1 [6, 7]
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T3	
T4	Span 3068 3193	Healthy mitochondria with intact membrane potential (∆Ψm) rapidly import and degrade PINK1 via mitochondrial proteases [7, 8]
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T4	
T5	Span 20831 20998	This is unexpected since most studies have reported that accumulation of PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane is required for recruitment of Parkin [6, 7, 28, 29]
