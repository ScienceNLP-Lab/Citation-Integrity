T5	Span 23629 23789	Furthermore, many studies have revealed that the stimulation of autophagy can reduce Aβ accumulation and alleviate memory deficits in transgenic AD mice [45-48]

T6	Span 26562 26762	In two independent mouse models of AD, rapamycin, through inhibition of mTOR signaling, rescued cognitive deficits by suppressing extracellular Aβ deposition and intracellular tau accumulation [45,63]

T7	Span 26764 27006	Interestingly, this treatment induced autophagy marked by increased expression of Atg 7, Atg5-Atg12, decrease in p62, no modification of LC3 expression and controversial results surrounding LC3-II expression in PDAPP and 3xTg-AD mice [45,46].
