T6	Span 20488 20688	The EPHA4 finding was interesting in that EPHA1, also a member of the ephrin gene family, was later identified and replicated in two large case control GWAS (Hollingworth et al. 2011; Naj et al. 2011)

T7	Span 43904 44047;44131 44230	A number of case control studies combined ADNI results with results from multiple other cohorts and performed meta-analytic analyses, including GWAS analyses (Antunez et al. 2011a; Hollingworth et al. 2011; Kamboh et al. 2012; Naj et al. 2011)
