T4	Span 3152 3275	Thus far, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of LOAD have identified over 20 significantly associated risk loci [5]–[7]
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T4	
T5	Span 4221 4502	Included among these SNPs were the 28 genome-wide significant SNPs from 21 non-APOE LOAD risk loci (PICALM, BIN1, CD33, CD2AP, MS4A4A/MS4A6E, ABCA7, EPHA1, CLU, CR1, HLA-DRB5/HLA-DRB1, PTK2B, SORL1, SLC24A4/RIN3, DSG2, INPP5D, MEF2C, NME8, ZCWPW1, CELF1, FERMT2, and CASS4) [5]-[7]
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T5	
T6	Span 4818 4942	IRB approval and informed consent procedures were outlined in each of the publications from which SNPs were selected [5]-[9]
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T6	
T7	Span 7181 7529	Interestingly only 3 of these 34 SNPs were the reported genome-wide significant SNPs (ZCWPW1/rs1476679, score = 1f; ABCA7/rs3764650, score = 2b; and CLU/rs1532278, score = 2b), one was a reported suggestive SNP (HRK/RNFT2/rs17429217, score = 2b), and the remaining 30 were in LD (r2≥0.80) with the 44 lead SNPs reported in LOAD GWA studies [5]–[9].
