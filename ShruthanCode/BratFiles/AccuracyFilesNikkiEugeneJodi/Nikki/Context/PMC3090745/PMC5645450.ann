T3	Span 4299 4721	TYROBP (TYROsine kinase Binding Protein) (also known as DAP12), is a microglial transmembrane signaling polypeptide that contains an immunoreceptor phosphotyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain and is a direct partner/adaptor for immune receptors, including TREM2, CR3, and SIRPβ1 (Signal Regulatory Protein β1) all of which are independently linked to, or associated with, LOAD [5, 7, 23, 55, 86
