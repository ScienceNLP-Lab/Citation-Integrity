T9	Span 2175 2432	Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) each including more than 5,000 Caucasians identified genome-wide significant associations for LOAD with nine other loci including ABCA7, BIN1, CD2AP, CD33, CLU, CR1, EPHA1, MS4A gene cluster, and PICALM [4], [5
R1	Context Target:T0 Context:T9	
T10	Span 4735 4947	Summarized information from tests of genetic association of AD with SNPs located in the candidate gene regions was culled from a recent large GWAS conducted by the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) [5]
R2	Context Target:T1 Context:T10	
T11	Span 4949 5238	Results were computed for SNPs throughout the genome in a sample composed of 11,840 AD cases and 10,931 cognitively normal elders from 15 independent Caucasian data sets. Details of the quality control and statistical analysis procedures and genetic models has been published elsewhere [5]
R3	Context Target:T2 Context:T11	
T12	Span 13081 13382	We added rs11218343 to this stage of the analysis because it was the most significant SORL1 SNP in the large Caucasian dataset (P = 1.0×10−7), a result which emerged after pooling the Caucasian discovery GWAS sample and unpublished data in the replication sample from our previously published GWAS [5]
R4	Context Target:T4 Context:T12	
T13	Span 14268 14400	Next, we investigated whether robust genetic associations for LOAD reported previously in Caucasians [4], [5] generalize to Japanese
R5	Context Target:T5 Context:T13	
T14	Span 17175 17364	The rarity of these SNPs in Caucasians, as well as allelic heterogeneity, may explain why SORL1 did not previously emerged as a genome-wide significant AD locus in much larger GWAS [4], [5]
R6	Context Target:T6 Context:T14	
T15	Span 18384 18606	We obtained evidence in Japanese and Korean populations for association of AD with the same SNPs in the PICALM and BIN1 regions that were identified as genome-wide significant in multiple large GWAS in Caucasians [4], [5].
R7	Context Target:T7 Context:T15	
T16	Span 19778 19824;19877 19974	PVRL2 and APOE are located in a genomic region where strong association signals for LOAD have been reproducibly detected in Caucasians [1], [5],
R8	Context Target:T8 Context:T16
