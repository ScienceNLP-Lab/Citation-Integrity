T2	Span 4151 4513	Most recent genetic studies of AD have focused on the identification of common variants associated with risk for AD through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These studies have identified several new genes that show significant association after multiple test correction in multiple datasets: CLU, PICALM, BIN1, CR1, ABCA7, MS4A6A, CD33 and CD2AP [31]–[35]
