T8	Context 0 277	The DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium recently published the largest T2D GWAS meta-analysis to date (DIAGRAMv3), identifying many additional common variants associated with T2D and bringing the total number of independent T2D loci to 65 (12).
T2	Minor 10825 11135	Figure 1 presents the distribution of Z-scores from Stage 2, aligned to the risk allele from Stage 1, at a subset of 3,412 independent (CEU r2 < 0.05) T2D replication variants that excludes lead SNPs and possible proxies (CEU r2 ≥ 0.1) at the 63 newly discovered and established loci represented on Metabochip.
T3	Minor 12945 13217	Using simulations, based on parameter estimates from this mixture model, we estimated that 488 (95% confidence interval (CI) 456–521) of the independent replication SNPs, in addition to the 63 newly discovered and established loci, are associated with T2D susceptibility.
