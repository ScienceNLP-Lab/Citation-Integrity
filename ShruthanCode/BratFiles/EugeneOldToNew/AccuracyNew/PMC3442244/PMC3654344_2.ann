T1	Citation 286 288	35
T3	Context 0 289	A fundamental challenge facing those wishing to determine which of the genes in a particular locus is responsible for affecting disease risk, and dissect how this/these act, is the very scale of the problem (currently more than 500 genes in total to interrogate, with others emerging) [35]
T4	ACCURATE 38381 38652	While such a model poses challenges for accumulating genome-wide significant evidence of association at a specific variant, it does suggest that genetic profiling based on the entirety of sequence variation has the potential to provide useful risk stratification for T2D.
