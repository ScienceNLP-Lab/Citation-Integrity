T2	Context 0 142	According to the most recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies, 63 individual SNPs have now been linked with diabetes risk [1].
T1	ACCURATE 10173 10447	Assuming a T2D population prevalence of 8%, these 63 newly discovered and established autosomal loci together account for 5.7% of variance in disease susceptibility, as calculated by transforming dichotomous disease risk onto a continuous liability scale20 (Online Methods).
T3	ACCURATE 10667 10977	Figure 1 presents the distribution of Z-scores from Stage 2, aligned to the risk allele from Stage 1, at a subset of 3,412 independent (CEU r2 < 0.05) T2D replication variants that excludes lead SNPs and possible proxies (CEU r2 ≥ 0.1) at the 63 newly discovered and established loci represented on Metabochip.
T4	ACCURATE 12787 13059	Using simulations, based on parameter estimates from this mixture model, we estimated that 488 (95% confidence interval (CI) 456–521) of the independent replication SNPs, in addition to the 63 newly discovered and established loci, are associated with T2D susceptibility.
