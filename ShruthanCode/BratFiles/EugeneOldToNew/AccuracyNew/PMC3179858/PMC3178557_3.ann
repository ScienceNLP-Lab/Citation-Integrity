T5	Context 2432 2558	Contrarily to A3A, SAMHD1 is expressed in cells other than myeloid cells, as its isolation from HEK 293T cells indicates [59].
T1	ACCURATE 7759 7910	Specifically, we directed the assembly of three sets of protein complexes in HEK 293T cells for their subsequent proteomic characterization (Figure 2a)
T3	ACCURATE 11459 11613	SAMHD1 was co-expressed with wild type SIVmac Vpx, a VpxQ76A variant that does not bind DCAF1, or HIV-1 Vpr that does not bind SAMHD1, in HEK 293T cells. 
T4	ACCURATE 19832 20052	SAMHD1 is expressed in HEK 293T cells, undifferentiated THP-1 cells and other non-myeloid cell types that do not possess a Vpx-sensitive mechanism restricting primate lentivirus infection (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7).
