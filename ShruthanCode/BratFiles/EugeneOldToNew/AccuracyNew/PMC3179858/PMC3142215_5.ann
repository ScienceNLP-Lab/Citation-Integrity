T13	Context 594 732	Together, these studies suggested that SAMHD1 is the myeloid-cell specific HIV-1 restriction factor counteracted by Vpx [9,10] (Figure 1).
T1	ACCURATE 17404 17624	SAMHD1 is expressed in HEK 293T cells, undifferentiated THP-1 cells and other non-myeloid cell types that do not possess a Vpx-sensitive mechanism restricting primate lentivirus infection (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7).
T2	ACCURATE 17625 17731	One possible explanation is that SAMHD1-mediated restriction may require a myeloid cell-specific molecule.
