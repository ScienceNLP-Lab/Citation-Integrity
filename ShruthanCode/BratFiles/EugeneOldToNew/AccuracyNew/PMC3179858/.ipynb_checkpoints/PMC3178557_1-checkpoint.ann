T3	Context 1454 1705	Despite the fact that SAMHD1 is expressed in different cell types, it seems to restrict lentiviral infection specifically in myeloid cells, probably highlighting the need for a particular cellular context, or for specific cellular partners [59], [60].
T1	ACCURATE 18926 19185	Of note, we observed that SAMHD1 levels are depleted by Vpx in both MDM and monocyte- derived dendritic cells in a Vpx glutamine Q76 dependent manner (data not shown) implicating SAMHD1 as the key AGS protein inhibiting lentivirus infection in myeloid cells. 
T2	ACCURATE 18377 18597	SAMHD1 is expressed in HEK 293T cells, undifferentiated THP-1 cells and other non-myeloid cell types that do not possess a Vpx-sensitive mechanism restricting primate lentivirus infection (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7).
