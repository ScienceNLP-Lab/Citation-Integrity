T7	Context 1722 1929	These included a neuronal module that was enriched for genes with low GWAS P-values, suggesting that the differential expression of this module between cases and controls reflects a causal relationship [20].
T2	ACCURATE 21401 21710	These results indicate that (a) M12 consists of a set of genes that are supported by independent lines of evidence to be causally involved in ASD pathophysiology, and (b) the upregulation of immune response genes in the autistic brain observed by us and others25 has no evidence of a common genetic component.
T3	ACCURATE 3192 3405	Moreover, using a published autism GWAS dataset, we show that the neuronal module is enriched for genetically associated variants, providing independent support for the causal involvement of these genes in autism.
