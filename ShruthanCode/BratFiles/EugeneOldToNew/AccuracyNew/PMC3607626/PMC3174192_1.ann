T3	Context 767 938	To date, a number of studies have investigated gene expression in ASD (for review see [29]), with three examining ASD brain tissue on a genome-wide scale [30], [31], [32].
T1	ACCURATE 20246 20597	As a negative control, we performed the same set-enrichment analysis using two GWAS studies for non-psychiatric disease performed on the same genotyping platform: a genome-wide association for hair color23, and a GWAS study of Warfarin maintenance dose24 finding no significant enrichment of the association signal (Figure 4b, Supplementary Figure 4).
T2	ACCURATE 2389 2602	Moreover, using a published autism GWAS dataset, we show that the neuronal module is enriched for genetically associated variants, providing independent support for the causal involvement of these genes in autism.
T4	ACCURATE 2603 2737	In contrast, the immune-glial module showed no enrichment for autism GWAS signals, indicating a non-genetic etiology for this process.
