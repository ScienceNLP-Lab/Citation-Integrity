T5	Context 278 470	The most comprehensive transcriptomics study of ASD post-mortem brain to date (Voineagu et al) concludes that one of two significant co-expression networks is involved in immune function [32].
T1	ACCURATE 21718 21989	The genome-wide analysis performed here significantly extends previous findings implicating synaptic dysfunction, as well as microglial and immune dysregulation in ASD6 by providing an unbiased systematic assessment of transcriptional alterations and their genetic basis.
T3	ACCURATE 21990 22311	We show that the transcriptome changes observed in ASD brain converge with GWAS data in supporting the genetic basis of synaptic and neuronal signaling dysfunction in ASD, while immune changes have a less pronounced genetic component and thus are most likely either secondary phenomena or caused by environmental factors.
T4	ACCURATE 22312 22528	Since immune molecules and cells such as microglia play a role in synaptic development and function26, we speculate that the observed immune up- regulation may be related to abnormal ongoing plasticity in ASD brain.
