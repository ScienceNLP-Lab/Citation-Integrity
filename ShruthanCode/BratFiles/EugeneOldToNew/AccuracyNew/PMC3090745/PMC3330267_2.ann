T3	Context 543 891	Examining the amount of genetic risk effect attributable to these genes (other than APOE), the most strongly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms at each locus have population attributable fractions between 2.72 and 5.97%, with a cumulative population attributable fraction for non-APOE loci estimated to be as much as 35% (Naj et al., 2011).
T2	ACCURATE 18407 19017	Examining the amount of genetic effect attributable to these candidate genes, the most strongly associated SNPs at each locus other than APOE demonstrated population attributable fractions (PAFs) between 2.72–5.97% (Supplemental Table 9), with a cumulative PAF for non-APOE loci estimated to be as much as 35%; however, these estimates may vary widely between studies22, and the actual effect sizes are likely to be much smaller than those estimated here because of the ‘winner’s curse’. Also the results do not account for interaction among loci, and are not derived from appropriate population-based samples.
