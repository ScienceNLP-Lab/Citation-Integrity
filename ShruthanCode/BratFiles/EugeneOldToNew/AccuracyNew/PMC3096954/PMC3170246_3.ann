T11	Context 588 770	Since claudin-low tumors possess features of stem cells [7], it is possible that the tumors that regress and recur or only partially regress are those that contain claudin-low cells.
T1	ACCURATE 22477 22782	Second, we observed that claudin- low tumors compared to the other tumor subtypes, except for the normal breast- like group, showed the highest mRNA expression of ALDH1A1, which has recently been proposed to be another marker of breast stem cells and TICs [34] but also noted in stromal cells [24,34,35]. 
T3	ACCURATE 23361 23555	To further explore the potential enrichment for breast stem cells and TIC features, we evaluated the expression of three breast stem cell-like signatures [7,15,18] across the different subtypes.
T4	ACCURATE 58182 58396	In this article, we characterize an important new disease group, namely the claudin-low subtype of breast cancer, and show that these tumors have a poor prognosis and features of mesenchymal and mammary stem cells.
