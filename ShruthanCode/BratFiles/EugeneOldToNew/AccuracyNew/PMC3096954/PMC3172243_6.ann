T12	Context 550 729	CD44+/CD24- is considered a cancer stem cell or tumor initiating cell signature, and high CD44/CD24 ratios are characteristic of aggressive Claudin-low tumors and cell lines [20].
T1	ACCURATE 3974 4380	More recently, a tumor initiating cell (TIC) genomic signature derived from CD44+/CD24-/low-sorted cells and mammospheres obtained from primary human breast tumors was found to be exclusively enriched by gene expression in the claudin-low subtype [6,7], and the expression of this CD44+/CD24-/low/claudin-low profile increased in posttreatment samples after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormone therapy [7].
