T4	Context 758 934	We, and others, have previously shown that rapamycin reduces soluble AÎ² and tau pathology and the associated early cognitive deficits in 6-month-old transgenic mice [29], [32].
T2	ACCURATE 3160 3338	Our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease.
T3	ACCURATE 3339 3458	Rapamycin, already used in clinical settings, may be a potentially effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.
