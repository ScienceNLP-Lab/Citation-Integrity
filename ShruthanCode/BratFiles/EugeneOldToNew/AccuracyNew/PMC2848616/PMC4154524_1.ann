T5	Context 161 322	Furthermore, many studies have revealed that the stimulation of autophagy can reduce Aβ accumulation and alleviate memory deficits in transgenic AD mice [45-48].
T1	ACCURATE 20082 20333	Our data suggest that the reduction in Aβ42 levels and the improvement in cognitive function in rapamycin-treated PDAPP mice may be a consequence of the induction of autophagy in hippocampus ( Fig. 3 ) by high levels of Aβ in PDAPP transgenic brains.
