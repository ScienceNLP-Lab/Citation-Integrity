#1	AnnotatorNotes T1	Information can be collected from title of paper/does not offer any further insight outside of title information.
T3	ACCURATE 22648 22849	In summary, our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin[5], an intervention that extends lifespan in mice[5], [6], can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease.
