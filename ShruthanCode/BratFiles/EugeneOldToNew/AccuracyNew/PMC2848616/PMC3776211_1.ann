T4	Context 484 630	There is also evidence of an association between mTOR signalling and beta-amyloid, although the nature of the association is uncertain [18,28,29].
T1	ACCURATE 20820 21103	Consistent with a key role for high levels of Aβ in the activation of autophagy when mTOR activity is reduced, rapamycin did not induce autophagy in brains of rapamycin-treated non-transgenic mice, in which levels of endogenous Aβ are much lower than those in PDAPP transgenic brains
T2	ACCURATE 1174 1303	Inhibition of mTOR by Rapamycin Abolishes Cognitive Deficits and Reduces Amyloid-β Levels in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease
