T2	Context 749 821	Autophagy has been shown to protect neurons from Aβ induced cytotoxicity
T1	ACCURATE 2057 2366	As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ
