T1	MultiCitation 246 262	Yan et al., 2010
T9	Context 23 221	HIV-encoded cytosolic DNA produced by reverse transcription does not trigger a cell-autonomous interferon (IFN) or inflammatory response in activated CD4 T cells and macrophages, its primary targets
T2	ACCURATE 2145 2209	The cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 suppressed IFN triggered by HIV.
T3	ACCURATE 2437 2588	TREX1 bound to cytosolic HIV DNA and digested excess HIV DNA that would otherwise activate IFN expression via a TBK1, STING and IRF3 dependent pathway.
