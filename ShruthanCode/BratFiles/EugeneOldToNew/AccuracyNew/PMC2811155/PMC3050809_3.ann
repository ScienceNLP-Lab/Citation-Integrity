T6	Context 0 183	Several studies reported that mitochondrial stress, such as exposure to membrane potential inhibitors, initiates the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway [14], [15], [16], [17], [20], [28].
T1	ACCURATE 64674 64963	Although the proximate cause of these abnormalities in PINK1 null cells remains obscure, one explanation may be the failure of PINK1/Parkin pathway to eliminate oxidatively damaged mitochondria, which accumulate over time as a natural consequence of metabolism and other cellular stresses.
