T0	MultiCitation 570 591	Narendra et al., 2010
T6	Context 365 619	Consistent with genetic studies in flies that indicated that they work in the same pathway, Parkin translocation and mitophagy induction require PINK1 activity (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010; Vives-Bauza et al., 2010).
T1	ACCURATE 33050 33327	Consistent with genetic studies in Drosophila, these findings show that Parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria and Parkin-induced mitophagy are downstream of PINK1 expression, whereas PINK1 accumulation in response to depolarization is upstream of Parkin recruitment.
