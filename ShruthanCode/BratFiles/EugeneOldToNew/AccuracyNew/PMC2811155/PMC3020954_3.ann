T5	Context 2267 2367	PINK1 kinase activity is required for many Parkin functions and Parkin acts downstream of PINK1 [11]
T1	ACCURATE 3340 3574	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps.
T3	ACCURATE 7159 7371	Interestingly, overexpression of Parkin can partially compensate for PINK1 loss, but PINK1 overexpression cannot compensate for Parkin loss, suggesting that PINK1 functions upstream of Parkin in a common pathway.
T4	ACCURATE 25193 25345	Together, these results show that PINK1 accumulation is upstream of Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria and independent of Parkin expression.
