T8	Context 0 229	PINK1, a mitochondrial kinase, is essential for the Parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria and for Parkin-mediated mitophagy (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010; Vives-Bauza et al., 2010).
T1	ACCURATE 1288 1523	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps.
