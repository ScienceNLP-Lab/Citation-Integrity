T7	MultiCitation 1663 1684	Narendra et al., 2010
T15	Context 1547 1685	When we treated HeLa cells stably expressing YFP-Parkin with MG132 for 8 h to accumulate the 52-kD PINK1 (Fig. 1 c; Narendra et al., 2010)
T1	ACCURATE 40562 40742	Cells treated with vehicle or 250 nM AP21967 for 8 h were scored for mCherry-Parkin in puncta characteristic of mitochondria in ≥150 cells in three or more independent experiments.
T2	Minor 2264 2339	PINK1 Is Selectively Stabilized on Impaired Mitochondria to Activate Parkin
#1	AnnotatorNotes T2	Information is not directly mentioned in the article. May have to look at figures in the actual article to confirm accuracy.
T3	Major 20275 20526	When MG132 is added during the final hour of treatment in HeLa cells treated with vehicle, an ∼52-kDa band appears, consistent with the cleavage product of full-length Parkin described in previous reports [22],[28],[30] (Figure 2A, lane 1 vs. lane 2).
#2	AnnotatorNotes T3	Denotes wrong procedure than what is stated in the article.
