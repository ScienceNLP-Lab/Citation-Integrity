T7	Context 788 924	the “increased” mfn levels in pink1 or parkin knockdown flies may reflect an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis in these mutants [17].
T1	ACCURATE 32021 32186	These results are consistent with endogenous PINK1 promoting mitochondrial degradation in the context of continued (or increased) mitochondrial biogenesis [37],[38].
T2	ACCURATE 32670 32765	These data suggest that PINK1 promotes mitophagy in the context of endogenous levels of Parkin.
T4	ACCURATE 32766 33009	Additionally, these results suggest that the selective turnover of dysfunctional mitochondria may be balanced by the biogenesis of new mitochondria, allowing exchange of damaged, dysfunctional mitochondria for healthy, functional mitochondria.
