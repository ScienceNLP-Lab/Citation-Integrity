T2	Context 833 1090	We and others have previously demonstrated that endogenous PINK1 behaves similarly to the overexpressed PINK1 counterparts in that PINK1 FL accumulates under valinomycin treatment and PINK1 Δ1 and Δ2 accumulate under proteasome inhibitor treatment [9,12,22]
T1	ACCURATE 9323 9567	When HeLa cells are treated with CCCP, which depolarizes mitochondria by increasing membrane permeability to H+, a large increase in endogenous full-length PINK1 (∼63 kDa) is seen beginning by 30 min and continuing for at least 3 h (Figure 1A).
T3	ACCURATE 9569 9777	his ∼63-kDa band also increases in the mitochondria-rich membrane fraction following treatment with valinomycin, which, unlike CCCP, depolarizes mitochondria by permeabilizing the membrane to K+ (Figure S1A).
