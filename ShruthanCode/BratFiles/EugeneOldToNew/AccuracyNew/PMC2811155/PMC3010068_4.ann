T9	Context 159 410	In contrast to inhibition of transcription, inhibition of translation by treatment with cycloheximide (CHX) prevents both the CCCP-dependent induction of PINK1 expression and Parkin translocation to CCCP-uncoupled mitochondria (Narendra et al., 2010).
T1	ACCURATE 43554 43864	Although these findings do not prove new PINK1 synthesis is required for Parkin recruitment (cycloheximide blocks de novo synthesis of all proteins and thus may inhibit Parkin recruitment independently of PINK1 accumulation), they suggest that PINK1 accumulation and Parkin recruitment may be casually related.
T2	ACCURATE 42869 43041	A 90-min treatment with cycloheximide, likewise, blocked Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria by confocal microscopy (96.0±3.5% vs. 11.3±4.2%) (Figure 7C and 7D).
