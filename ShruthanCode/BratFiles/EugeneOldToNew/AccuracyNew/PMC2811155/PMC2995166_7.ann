T1	ACCURATE 13225 13510	We found that, similar to YFP-Parkin [21], PINK1-YFP accumulates selectively on mitochondria with low membrane potential, demonstrating that PINK1 is selectively stabilized on the depolarized mitochondria within a bioenergetically diverse population of mitochondria (Figure 1E and 1F).
