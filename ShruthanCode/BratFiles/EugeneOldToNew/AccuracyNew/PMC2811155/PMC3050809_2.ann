T2	ACCURATE 3142 3356	Since disease-causing mutations in PINK1 or Parkin disrupt this pathway, patients with these mutations may not be able to clean up their damaged mitochondria, leading to the neuronal damage typical of parkinsonism.
T3	ACCURATE 30691 30809	We found that Parkin-induced mitophagy is also dependent on PINK1 expression in the M17 human neuroblastoma cell line.
T4	ACCURATE 30995 31122	These results suggest that PINK1 is necessary for the mitophagy of depolarized mitochondria following overexpression of Parkin.
T6	ACCURATE 62915 63249	Alternatively, Parkin may serve other functions in the cell that are independent of PINK1 and protect against mitochondrial dysfunction indirectly; or Parkin may function to some degree upon overexpression independently of mitochondrial docking, perhaps effecting mitophagy or other mitochondrial changes from the cytosolic compartmen
