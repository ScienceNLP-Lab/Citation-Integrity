T8	Context 519 825	Upon mitochondrial damage or uncoupling, Parkin relocalizes to mitochondria and can mediate the autophagic elimination of damaged mitochondria (Narendra et al., 2008), which is dependent on PINK1 kinase activity (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010; Vives-Bauza et al., 2010).
T1	AccurateSeg 54515 54896	We recently reported that the Parkinson disease-linked E3 ubiquitin ligase, Parkin, is selectively recruited to dysfunctional mitochondria with low membrane potential to promote their autophagic degradation, suggesting that a deficiency of mitochondrial quality control may underlie the observed mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkin knockout Drosophila and mice [11]â€“[15],[17],[21].
T2	AccurateSeg 1726 1961	PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease- causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin- induced mitophagy at distinct steps. 
T3	AccurateSeg 3067 3226	In this pathway, PINK1 acts as a flag that accumulates on dysfunctional mitochondria and then signals to Parkin, which tags these mitochondria for destruction.
T4	AccurateSeg 3227 3441	Since disease-causing mutations in PINK1 or Parkin disrupt this pathway, patients with these mutations may not be able to clean up their damaged mitochondria, leading to the neuronal damage typical of parkinsonism.
T5	AccurateSeg 7451 7590	In this model, PINK1 and Parkin form a pathway for sensing and selectively eliminating damaged mitochondria from the mitochondrial network.
