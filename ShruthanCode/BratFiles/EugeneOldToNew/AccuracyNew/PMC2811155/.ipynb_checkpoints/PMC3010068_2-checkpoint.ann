T7	Span 536 759	To achieve this, we applied two Parkin mutants: ParkinR275W, which translocates to depolarized mitochondria but fails to induce mitophagy; and ParkinC441R, which fails to translocate to mitochondria (Narendra et al., 2010).

T2	AccurateSeg 38812 39100	Although expression of Parkin R275W was moderately less than wild type, it also increases localization in the membrane fraction and decreases in the supernatant upon CCCP treatment, consistent with the mitochondrial translocation seen for this mutation by confocal microscopy (Figure 9C).
T3	AccurateSeg 38251 38423	Although under control conditions some mutants formed visible aggregates (Figure S8D), no mutant, including R275W, colocalized with mitochondria (Figure 9B and Figure S8E).
T4	AccurateSeg 40283 40512	Interestingly, the R275W mutation in RING1 also exhibited a severe deficit in mitophagy (4.0Â±4%) (Figure 9D and 9E) even though it appears to largely retain its ability to translocate to uncoupled mitochondria (Figure 9A and 9B).
