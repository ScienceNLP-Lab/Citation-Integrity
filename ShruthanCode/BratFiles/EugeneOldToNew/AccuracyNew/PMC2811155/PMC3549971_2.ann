T4	Context 0 223	Previously examined Parkin mutations that occur in PD patients display a range of mitochondrial translocation activities but most fail to induce mitophagy (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010).
T2	ACCURATE 3951 4165	Since disease-causing mutations in PINK1 or Parkin disrupt this pathway, patients with these mutations may not be able to clean up their damaged mitochondria, leading to the neuronal damage typical of parkinsonism.
T3	ACCURATE 3791 3950	In this pathway, PINK1 acts as a flag that accumulates on dysfunctional mitochondria and then signals to Parkin, which tags these mitochondria for destruction.
