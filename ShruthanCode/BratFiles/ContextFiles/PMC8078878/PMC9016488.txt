Short-term Adverse Events After the Third Dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine in Adults 60 Years or Older

Introduction

On July 29, 2021, concerns of waning immunity after Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162B2 mRNA vaccination led the Israeli Ministry of Health to start a campaign to administer booster (third) doses to individuals who received their second dose at least 5 months prior.1,2 The booster was initially approved for individuals 60 years or older. This survey study assessed the occurrence of adverse effects (AEs) in adults 60 years or older who received a booster dose.

Methods

This study was conducted among members of Clalit Health Services (CHS), which insures more than half of the Israeli population. Study participants were individuals 60 years or older who received the booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in the first 5 days of the campaign (July 30 to August 3, 2021). The CHS institutional review board approved this study, with a waiver of informed consent because deidentified survey data were used. This study followed the AAPOR reporting guideline for survey studies.

Individuals aged 60 to 79 years were sent a text message with a request to complete an online survey (eTable in the Supplement) regarding AEs. For those 80 years or older, a random sample (41.8%) was contacted by telephone and interviewed.

The survey process comprised 2 sequential surveys conducted 5 to 11 days (August 8-10, 2021) and 20 to 28 days (August 23-26, 2021) after the initiation of the campaign. For participants who responded to both surveys, we considered only the latter response. Individuals’ demographic and clinical characteristics were extracted from their electronic health records.

Results

Of 82 392 CHS members 60 years or older who received a booster dose during the study period, 66 094 were contacted, with 27 046 (40.9%) responding to the survey. The median age of respondents was 71 years (IQR, 66-75 years); 43.6% of respondents were aged 60 to 69 years; 44.5%, 70 to 79 years; and 12.0%, 80 years or older. The proportion of female respondents was 45.3%, and 49.2% had at least 1 risk factor for severe COVID-19 (Table 1).

Of the respondents, 30.0% reported at least 1 AE, 24.8% reported local reactions, and 16.6% reported systemic reactions. The most common AEs included pain at the injection site (23.5%), fatigue (9.7%), and malaise (7.2%) (Table 2).

Most of the respondents (67.8%) reported that their general feeling after the booster was similar to the feeling after the second dose; 18.7% and 11.1% reported a milder or worse response, respectively. Only 1.2% sought medical attention owing to an AE.

Females were more likely than males to report AEs (39.0% vs 22.6%). The proportion of females who reported systemic reactions was nearly double that of males (22.9% vs 11.4%). Individuals aged 60 to 69 years were more likely to report systemic AEs than were individuals 70 years or older (20.5% vs 13.6%).

Discussion

We found that AEs after the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine booster dose were generally mild and usually did not require medical care. The proportion of self-reported AEs that occurred in our study was similar or lower than that after the administration of the second vaccine dose in several previous studies.3,4 A study by Menni et al4 found a similar proportion of systemic reactions among older individuals after the second vaccine dose as after the third dose in our study (16.4% vs 16.6%).

The proportion of female respondents who reported systemic AEs was greater than the proportion of male respondents, with higher proportions among participants in the younger age group (60-69 years) than in the older age groups. Similar results were reported in previous studies after administration of the second vaccine dose.3,4,5 A limitation of our study was the different survey methods in different age groups, which might have resulted in differences in reported proportions of AEs.
