A novel linker-immunodominant site (LIS) vaccine targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein protects against severe COVID-19 in Syrian hamsters
ABSTRACT

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is unlikely to abate until sufficient herd immunity is built up by either natural infection or vaccination. We previously identified ten linear immunodominant sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein of which four are located within the RBD. Therefore, we designed two linkerimmunodominant site (LIS) vaccine candidates which are composed of four immunodominant sites within the RBD (RBD-ID) or all the 10 immunodominant sites within the whole spike (S-ID). They were administered by subcutaneous injection and were tested for immunogenicity and in vivo protective efficacy in a hamster model for COVID-19. We showed that the S-ID vaccine induced significantly better neutralizing antibody response than RBD-ID and alum control. As expected, hamsters vaccinated by S-ID had significantly less body weight loss, lung viral load, and histopathological changes of pneumonia. The S-ID has the potential to be an effective vaccine for protection against COVID-19.

Introduction

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in significant mortality, morbidity, and socioeconomic disruptions globally [1]. As of 15 December 2020, SARS-CoV-2 is highly efficient in person-to-person transmission and has caused more than 70 million cases with nearly 1.6 million deaths [2] [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update---15december-2020]. Symptomatic COVID-19 is characterized by systemic symptoms such as fever, myalgia, and lethargy, respiratory symptoms, and occasionally extrapulmonary manifestations such as diarrhea, anosmia, and ageusia [3]. It has been estimated that at least about 20% of COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic, which makes the control of the pandemic particularly difficult [2,4]. An effective and vaccine for COVID-19 is an essential countermeasure to halt the continuous dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 [5].

SARS-CoV-2 is a lineage B betacoronavirus which shares high sequence homology with SARS-CoV [6,7]. Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 employs its highly glycosylated spike (S) protein to enter to host cells. The receptor binding domain (RBD) at the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S protein interacts with the host surface receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme II (ACE2) to trigger virus-host cell membrane fusion [8]. Vaccine candidates developed using various platforms are being evaluated in different phases of clinical trials [9–13]. As of mid-December 2020, a number of COVID-19 vaccines, namely, the mRNA vaccine mRNA-1273 (Moderna), the inactivated vaccine CoronaVac (SinoVac), and the chimpanzee adenoviral-vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca), have been approved for emergency use in different parts of the world. We previously showed that patients can mount neutralizing antibody response against the receptor binding domain and N terminal domain of the S protein [14].

The persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic allows SARS-CoV-2 to continuously adapt to human with accumulation of immunologically relevant mutations in the population [15,16]. Antigenic drift has been documented among coronaviruses [17–20]. For example, the D480A/G mutation in the RBD of SARS-CoV-1 became the dominant variant during the SARS outbreak in 2003 [20]. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the D614G mutation in S protein is now found in the majority of the virus strains. Understanding B cell and antibody immunodominance is important for rational design of vaccines that can induce neutralizing antibodies against pathogens with antigenically variable strains [21,22]. We recently conducted a detailed analysis of the serological data of COVID19 patients and identified ten linear immunodominant (ID) sites on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein [23]. Some of these ID sites coincide with conformational epitopes identified by using S protein-specific monoclonal antibodies. We therefore asked whether these ID sites alone without the interlinking non-ID sites could serve as a novel vaccine that provides sufficient protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

In this study, we designed two linker-immunodominant sites (LIS) candidate vaccines composed of four or ten ID sites on the S protein. We demonstrated that both candidate vaccines could induce robust humoral and cellular response in mice and one of the candidates provided protection against severe disease in the golden Syrian hamster model for COVID-19.

Materials and methods

Cell line and viruses

SARS-CoV-2 (strain HKU-001a, GenBank accession number: MT230904) was propagated as previously described [24]. Stable cells of HEK293-hACE2 were prepared as previously described [25]. All cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral particles [replication-deficient murine leukaemia virus (MLV) pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein] were purchased from eEnzyme (cat no. SCV2-PsV-001). Cells were confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination by PlasmoTest (InvivoGen). All experiments involving live SARS-CoV-2 were conducted according to the approved standard operating procedures of the Biosafety Level 3 facilities at The University of Hong Kong (HKU) [26].

RBD-ID and S-ID polypeptide purification

The RBD-ID and S-ID DNA sequence was synthesized (BGI) and cloned into pET28a, resulting in p-4ID and p-10ID plasmid, respectively. To facilitate the purification, a hexa-His tag was added to the C-terminal of RBD-ID and S-ID. P-4ID and p-10ID were subsequently transformed into E. coli BL21(DE) strain. Bacterial pellet from 1L of bacterial culture were harvested by centrifugation. Followed by sonication, the pellets were resuspended in binding buffer (Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 20 mM imidazole). The soluble cell extracts were collected and filtered using a 0.22 μm membrane after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The filtrates were then loaded on a nickel-NTA Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). The bound proteins were eventually eluted with elution buffer (Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM imidazole). The purified proteins were identified using SDS-PAGE analysis and subject to endotoxin removal afterwards (Pierce).

Active immunization

RBD-ID and S-ID vaccine formulated with aluminum hydroxide gel adjuvant (Alum; 1 mg/ml) were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into BALB/c mice (10 per group, 25 µg/animal/injection) and golden Syrian hamsters (5 per group). The animals were subjected to booster vaccinations every 3 weeks (administered twice). Animals of the mock-immunized group received an equal amount of Alum in a mixture with PBS. The antibody titers in the serum samples collected from animals were documented by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after each booster vaccination as described elsewhere [23].

ELISPOT assay

Mice were sacrificed 5 days after the second booster vaccination (s.c.). After euthanasia, spleens were collected and single suspensions of splenocytes were obtained. Interferon gamma (IFN-)-producing and interleukin 17A (IL-17A)-producing splenocytes from vaccinated or control mice were analysed using a cytokine-specific enzyme linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay (R&D Systems, USA) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, splenocytes isolated from immunized mice were plated at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/well and induced with antigens (0.2 µg/well) in triplicate and incubated for 20 h at 37°C. Ionomycin (Sigma, USA) (1 µg/ml) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; Sigma) (50 ng/ml) were used as positive controls. Splenocytes from unstimulated, immunized mice and RPMI 1640-treated splenocytes were used as negative controls. After the cells were decanted, biotinylated primary monoclonal antibodies were added to each well and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The plates were incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate for 1 h at 37°C and subjected to colour development with TMB solution. Finally, the spots were enumerated using an Immunospot analyzer.

Pseudovirus-based virus neutralization test

Pseudovirus-based virus neutralization test (pVNT) was performed as described previously, with modifications [25]. In brief, pVNT was performed in HEK293-hACE2 stable cells. Murine leukemia virus–based SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped particles (Wuhan-Hu-1 strain) were purchased from eEnzyme (catalog number SCV2-PsV-001). Sera were serially diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and co-incubated with the equal volume of pseudovirus (1:10 dilution of the stock) for 30 min before adding to the cells. After incubation at 37°C for 36 h, firefly luciferase activity indicating pseudovirus entry was determined using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, catalog number E1501). Serum samples of five randomly selected COVID convalescent patients from 39 patients with COVID-19 between Jan 26, 2020, and March 18, 2020 were tested for neutralizing antibody titers. The patients provided written informed consent under UW 13-372, UW 13-265, and UW 19-470. The antiRBD immune serum was kindly provided by Prof. Kwok-yung Yuen's group.

Viral challenge experiment in golden Syrian hamsters

Male and female Syrian hamsters, aged 4–6 weeks old, were obtained from the Chinese University of Hong Kong Laboratory Animal Service Centre through the HKU Centre for Comparative Medicine Research. All the animal experimental procedures were approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research of HKU. Briefly, the hamsters were with subcutaneous two injections of RBD-ID, S-ID, or aluminum hydroxide gel (control) at day 0 and day 21, kept in Biosafety Level 2 housing and given access to standard pellet feed and water ad libitum, as previously described [25]. Each hamster was anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine (200 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and then intranasally inoculated with 105 plaque forming units (pfu) of SARS-CoV-2 in 100 µl DMEM. The hamsters were monitored twice daily for clinical signs of disease until 4 dpi when they were sacrificed for virological and histopathological analyses. Viral load and infectious virus titers in the lung tissue homogenates were quantified by qRT–PCR and plaque assay as previously described [26]. Histopathological analysis and immunofluorescence staining were performed as previously described [26]. The histological scores were determined as we described previously [27].

Statistical analysis

All data were analysed in GraphPad prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., CA, US). Differences between two groups were compared by unpaired Student's t-test.

Differences among three or more groups were compared by one-way ANOVA. Twotailed p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
