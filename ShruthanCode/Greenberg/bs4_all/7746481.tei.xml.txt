Apolipoprotein E type e4 allele frequency is not increased in patients with sporadic inclusion-body myositis

The apolipoprotein E ~enotype was determined for 11 patients with sporadic inclusion-body myositis. Seven cases had the genotype e31e3, the other four cases, e31e4. The frequency of the e4 allele in this group of patients (0.182) was not significantly increased compared with elderly controls (0.147; n = 58), in contrast to Alzheimer's disease in which there was a significant increase (0.328; n = 67). The e2 allele wa:~ not found in any of the 11 sporadic inclusion-body myositis patients and its frequency was decreased in Alzheimer's disease. Despite certain pathological similarities that exist between inclusion body myositis and Alzheimer's disease, their association with particular apolipoprotein E genotypes is distinct.

There are three major alleles of the apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene: e2, e3 and e4 [13]. The three isoforms encoded by these three alleles differ by single amino acid substitutions at two positions. The most common isoform is apoE3 that has Cys-ll2 and Arg-158. ApoE2 has Cys in both of these positions, while apoE4 has Arg in both.

A number of recent observations suggest that apoE might contribute to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A linkage between the apoE, type e4 allele and late-onset sporadic and familial AD [21,24] has now been established in a number of studies. Inheritance of the e4 allele is associated with a decreasing average age of onset of dementia [6,16,27]. In addition, development of AD is negatively assoc, iated with the presence of the e2 allele [5,26,28]. ApoE has been found to be associated, immunohistochemically, with senile plaques and extracellular tangles in AD [14,17,23,29] and with other types of amyloid deposits [14,2!9]. Interactions of apoE with both amyloid fl-protein (Ail) [20,23,29] and tau protein [25] in vitro have been provided as further evidence that apoE is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Nevertheless, the pathophysiological role that apoE plays in the development of AD is still unclear. The specificity for the association of particular apoE polymorphisms with AD is not exclusive. The e4 allele has been associated with Lewy body dementia [4,11,19], vascular dementia [8,15] and with cardiovascular disease [7], although there are contradictory reports on its association with cardiovascular disease [7]. In contrast, no such association has been found for Parkinson's disease or Huntington's chorea [11]. The e2 allele is associated with both hyperlipoprotinaemia [13] and longevity [22].

Sporadic inclusion-body myositis (S-IBM) is a slowly progressive muscle disease. Pathologically it is characterised by variable degrees of inflammation and the presence of rimmed vacuoles in muscle fibres [1]. Hereditary inclusion-body myopathy comprises a number of different syndromes that are characterised by vacuolation similar to that found in S-IBM but by an absence of inflammation [1]. The vacuolated muscle fibres in both the sporadic and hereditary disorders accumulate Ail, al-antichymotrypsin and ubiquitin [1] and also contain cytoplasmic twisted tubulofilaments that can be decorated by antibodies against tau protein [2]. Furthermore, apoE immunoreactivity is co-localised with both Afl-immunoreactivity and the twisted tubulofilaments found in vacuolated muscle fibres from patients with both sporadic and hereditary forms of the disease [3]. Thus these disorders are characterized by several pathological features that are found in AD brains. We have sought to determine whether these similarities are influenced by the inheritance of specific apoE alleles as observed in AD.

Biopsy specimens were obtained from 11 patients with S-IBM, all of whom had vacuolated muscle fibres containing inclusions. Inclusions were identified either by the characteristic twisted tubulofilaments, observed by electron microscopy, or by immunohistochemical reactivity with antibodies against both ubiquitin and phosphorylated tau. The extent of inflammation in these patients varied from sparse, in three cases, to severe. There was no evidence of a family history for the disease in any of the patients and the mean duration of disease was 4.6 _+ 1.3 years (range 1.5-15 years). Frozen brain tissue was used from 67 patients with autopsy-confirmed sporadic AD, and 58 age-matched, non-demented controls with no Alzheimer-type pathology at autopsy [11]. Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen tissue, following digestion with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) at 60°C for 60 min. DNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and the apoE genotype determined using the LiPA apoE kit (Innogenetics NV, Ghent, Belgium) as described by the manufacturer. Pearson îC 2 test, or Fisher's exact test where necessary, was used to compare the distribution of individual alleles with that found in the nondemented control group.

The allele distribution for S-IBM patients is shown in Table 1. Seven patients with S-IBM had a genotype of e3/e3 and the other four cases, e3/e4. One of the cases with an e4 allele had scanty inflammation, whereas two cases that were homozygous for the e3 allele had limited inflammation. Thus, the variable extent of inflammation that is characteristic for S-IBM [1] was not associated with the presence of a single e4 allele. Furthermore, the presence of an e4 allele was not associated with duration of disease since the genotypes for two patients that had the disease in excess of 10 years were e3/e4 and e3/e3.

The apoE allele frequencies in S-IBM patients were compared with those observed in 67 patients with sporadic AD and in 58 non-demented, age-matched controls (Table 1). The e4 allele frequency (0.18) was slightly greater in S-IBM than that observed in the general population (0.147) but did not differ significantly. This was in contrast to the elevated frequency observed in AD (0.328). Although the sample of S-IBM patients was small, none possessed an e2 allele. In AD, there was an under-representation of the e2 allele, as has been reported in other recent studies [5,26,28]. The frequency of the e2 allele was decreased even after allowing for the increased e4 allele frequency. When only the e2 and e3 alleles were studied, only 4 out of 90 alleles in AD patients (4.4%) ). There were no significant differences in the allele frequencies between S-IBM and controls.

were e2, compared with 10 out of 89 (10%) in the control group (~2 --2.2, P = 0.138).

Although the pathological deposits in S-IBM have immunoreactivity profiles similar to those found in the Alzheimer brain [1], including the presence of apoEimmunoreactive lesions [3], the apoE genotype distribution for patients with these two diseases differs. In AD, there is a positive association with the e4 allele [21,24] and a negative association with the e2 allele [5,26,28]. In contrast, S-IBM was not associated with any significant increase i~ the e4 allele. It is possible that the presence of the e2 allele may be protective against S-IBM, but a much larger sample size will be necessary to exclude the possibility that this is due simply to the rarity of this particular allele in the general population [7].

Despite a number of pathological features in common between AD and S-IBM [ 1,2], any proposed role for apoE in the pathophysiology of each disease would need to be distinct. One difference between the two diseases relates to the localization of the pathological filaments that react with apoE antiserum. In S-IBM, apoE-immunoreactive tubulofilaments occur in the cytoplasm. In AD, however, it is the extracellular Ail deposits and those neurofibrillary tangles which are predominantly extracellular that react with apoE antiserum [14,23,29]. Neither the tau nor Ail that accumulate in S-IBM have been characterized to the extent to which polymers of these proteins in AD have been. Therefore, the proteins that accumulate abnormally in S-IBM vacuoles may differ from those in AD in such a way that their interaction with specific apoE isoforms is distinct. Tau epitopes have been found in fibre lesions in a range of muscle disorders other than S-IBM [12], and this suggests that their accumulation may not be specific for S-IBM. There are conflicting reports on the nature of the tau in these diseases. Whereas the tau protein detected in S-IBM was phosphorylated [3], tau found in a variety of other disorders did not react with AT8, a monoclonal antibody dependent upon tau being phosphorylated at serine-202 [12], a residue that is abundantly phosphorylated in AD brain [9]. It will be necessary to determine the exact status of tau protein in S-IBM and other muscle disorders before further comparisons with AD can be made.

For AD, a hypothesis has been proposed in which apoE3 acts as a cofactor that protects or sequesters small amounts of non-phosphorylated mu, leaving it available for its normal role in rnicrotubule stabilization [ 18,25]. In this hypothesis, the rate of tau phosphorylation and PHF formation would be decreased in the presence of apoE3 and the lifespan of protected neurons increased. However, we have reported results that are inconsistent with this hypothesis [ 11 ]. First, the extent of abnormal tau accumulation does not differ between those AD patients who are homozygous for the e3 allele and those who possess an e4 allele. Second, those Lewy body dementia patients, who lack significant tau pathology, are characterized by an e4 allele frequency elevated to an extent similar to that found in AD. These findings :indicate that the e4 allele is not an aetiological factor that can account for tau pathology in AD. Similarly, the data described here provide no evidence to indicate that either apoE3 or apoE4 protect or confer risk with regard to abnormal tau accumulation in muscle fibres in S-IBM.

The existence of several S-IBM patients who are homozygous for e3 indicates that neither apoE2 nor apoE4 are essential for the development of this disease. Thus, it seems unlikely that presence of the e4 allele predisposes individuals to accumulate the twisted tubulofilaments characteristic of S-IBM. Likewise, apoE4 does hOt seem necessary to account for the abnormal accumulation of Ail or tau epitopes in these patients. The association of AD and S-IBM with diistinct apoE polymorphisms indicates a different role, if any, for apoE in the development of either disease. Further investigation of the interactions between apoE, Ail and tau may shed light on our understanding of the pathogenesis of these two disorders.
