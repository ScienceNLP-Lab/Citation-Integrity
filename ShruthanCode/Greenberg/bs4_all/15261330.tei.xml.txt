Transgenic mice expressing the human C99 terminal fragment of βAPP: effects on cytochrome oxidase activity in skeletal muscle and brain

In order to furnish a combined model of relevance to human inclusion-body myopathy and Alzheimer's disease, transgenic mice expressing human ␤APP-C99 in skeletal muscle and brain under the control of the cytomegalovirus/␤-actin promoter were produced (Tg13592). These transgenic mice develop A␤ deposits in muscles but not in brain. Cell metabolic activity was analyzed in brain regions and muscle by cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry, the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain. By comparison to age-matched controls of the C57BL/6 strain, CO activity was selectively increased in dark skeletal muscle fibers of Tg13592 mice. In addition, only increases in CO activity were obtained in those brain regions where a significant difference appeared. The CO activity of Tg13592 mice was elevated in several thalamic nuclei, including laterodorsal, ventromedial, and midline as well as submedial, intralaminar, and reticular. In contrast, the groups did not differ in most cortical regions, except for prefrontal, secondary motor, and auditory cortices, and in most brainstem regions, except for cerebellar (fastigial and interpositus) nuclei and related areas (red and lateral vestibular nuclei). No variation in cell density and surface area appeared in conjunction with these enzymatic alterations. The overproduction of ␤APP-C99 fragments in brain without (amyloidosis did not appear to affect the metabolic activity of structures particularly vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease.

Introduction

One of the main neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease is extracellular senile plaques, mainly composed of amyloid-␤ (A␤), a product of ␤-amyloid precursor protein (␤APP) processing (Selkoe, 1999). ␤APP is cleaved by ␤-secretase to generate a 99-residue carboxy-terminal fragment (C99) and then by ␥-secretase to generate A␤ 42 Abbreviations: AInt, anterior interposed cerebellar nucleus; Ctx, cerebellar cortex; Lat, lateral (dentate) cerebellar nucleus; LVe, lateral vestibular nucleus; Med, medial (fastigial) cerebellar nucleus. and A␤ 40 . The expression of 99 or 100 amino acid C-terminal sequences of human ␤APP produced high levels of ␤-amyloid peptides in the plasma of transgenic mice (Sandhu et al., 1991;Fukuchi et al., 1996). Aside from raising A␤ levels, ␤APP-carboxy-terminal fragments may be relevant to disease progression as such. These proteins were shown to accumulate intracellularly in patients with familial Alzheimer's disease (McPhie et al., 1997;Li et al., 1999) and to possess neurotoxic properties in cell cultures (Fukuchi et al., 1992(Fukuchi et al., , 1993;;Kammesheidt et al., 1992) and mouse brain after cellular transplantion (Neve et al., 1992;Fukuchi et al., 1994).

In order to test in vivo consequences of high A␤ levels in tissues, transgenic mice overexpressing human ␤APP-C99 in skeletal muscles, intestines, pancreas, and brain under the control of the cytomegalovirus/␤-actin promoter were produced (Fukuchi et al., 1996). Up to the age of 29 months, these Tg13592 mice contained A␤ fibrils in skeletal muscles, intestine, and pancreas, but not in brain (Fukuchi et al., 1998). This model offers the opportunity of measuring brain abnormalities caused by C99 overexpression without ␤-amyloidosis. By comparison to age-matched (15 months) non-transgenic controls, Tg13592 mice had spatial deficits and were less active in open-field and elevated plus-maze tests (Lalonde et al., 2002).

We therefore undertook to measure brain metabolic activity by means of cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry. CO is contained in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the terminal enzyme of oxidative phosphorylation, its activity and amount being closely related to neuronal activity (Wong-Riley, 1989). In contrast to the deoxyglucose method used for detecting short-term metabolic alterations, CO activity is an index of long-term metabolism, allowing the detection of local variations among brain structures during development (Liu and Wong-Riley, 2003;Nair et al., 1999) and aging (Ferrandiz et al., 1994). CO activity is strongly governed by excitatory glutamatergic synapses (Zhang and Wong-Riley, 1999) and affected in several neurodegenerative pathologies (Kish et al., 1999;Strazielle et al., 1998). In addition to glucose uptake and blood flow, CO activity has been found to be decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease (Kish et al., 1992(Kish et al., , 1999;;Pettegrew et al., 1994;Ibanez et al., 1998;de la Torre, 2000;Johnson and Albert, 2000;Valla et al., 2001). However, CO activity was either decreased or even increased in selective brain regions of two Alzheimer-like transgenic models with A␤ plaques, the latter result possibly due to glutamatergic excitotoxicity or functional compensation in the early stages of neuropathology (Reiman et al., 2000;Strazielle et al., 2003).

Because of the A␤ fibrils present in Tg13592 muscle, skeletal and cardiac muscles were also analyzed by the same method. In normal myoblasts, the insertion of the ␤APP gene caused an accumulation of ␤APP, A␤, and paired helical filaments containing hyperphosphorylated tau (Askanas et al., 1996), similar to that described in hereditary inclusion-body myopathy (hIBM) and sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM) (Askanas et al., 1994(Askanas et al., ,1998;;Askanas and Engel, 1998).

Materials and methods

Animals

Tg13592 mice were generated at the University of Washington, and backcrossed to the C57BL/6J background for more than eight generations at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, USA (Fukuchi et al., 1996(Fukuchi et al., , 1998)). The mice were air-freighted to the University of Rouen, France, for neurobehavioral evaluation and killed 1 day after the end of testing. The brain and muscles of the 15-month-old mice were then transported in dry ice to the University of Nancy. All procedures adhered to the recommendations of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the European Community Council for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (no 86/609/EEC), and the regulations of each university.

Western blot analysis

In order to attest ␤APP-C99 overexpression in Tg13592 mice, levels of the ␤APP products from the transgene were determined by Western blot analysis. Two mice from Tgl3592 and C57BL/6J groups were euthanized at 13 months of age. The brains and thigh muscles were homogenized in 2× Laemmli buffer (1× = 62.5 mmol/l Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromophenol blue). Twenty-five microgram of protein from each sample were applied to a 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamiode gel electrophoresis. Western blotting was performed by using the 994B antibody raised against the 39 carboxy-terminal residue of ␤APP (Fukuchi et al., 1996).

Cytochrome oxidase histochemistry

Animals and tissue preparation

The mice were decapitated and their brain quickly removed, snap-frozen in N-methylbutane at a temperature of −40 • C with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 • C. A leg muscle (flexor digitorum superficialis) and the heart muscle were rapidly dissected at the same time and handled in the same manner. Afterwards, the different tissues were serially cut into 20 m-thick coronal sections with a cryostat; the sections were mounted on gelatin-chrome alum-coated slides and stored at a temperature of −80 • C until processing.

CO histochemistry

Duplicate series of sections from each brain and muscles as well as several complete sets of their respective standards were prepared by using the Wong-Riley (1979) protocol, except for modifications in the postincubation period (Strazielle et al., 1998). Slides were incubated in the dark at 37 • C in a solution of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 50 mg DAB, 20 mg horse-heart cytochrome c, 4 g sucrose, and 18 mg catalase per 90 ml, stirred continously. The incubation time was respectively 30 and 45 min for muscle and brain sections. The slides were then washed in cold buffer for 5 min and immersed in a 10% buffered formalin solution for 30 min. The slides were washed a second time in buffer (2 × 5 min), dehydrated in successive ethanol and xylene baths, and coverslipped with Eukitt. The validation of the method was assured by the absence of the CO reaction product when DAB was removed or when 0.01 M potassium cyanide was added.

Preparation of CO standards

Standards for CO activity were prepared in cylindrical microtubes, filled by whole brain and heart homogenates, frozen, and kept at −80 • C until cut in the cryostat at the same time as the tissue sections. The mean specific activity of CO of these brain and heart homogenates was measured by spectrophotometry (Uvikon 930, Kontron Instruments, Strasbourg, France) at 500 nm, with the method of Hess and Pope (1953) modified by Strazielle et al. (1998), and the values obtained, 38.2 and 73.68 mol/(min × g of tissue), respectively, remained constant in −80 • C frozen standards for several months. The recorded signal was proportional to the amount of homogenate incubated and fully inhibited by potassium cyanide. As indicated by Gonzalez-Lima and Jones (1994), the validity of the CO measurements was demonstrated by the high linear correlation existing between the thickness of the tissue (10-30 m) and the staining intensity (r = +0.996 for brain and r = +0.995 for heart).

All of the products used in the histochemical and biochemical experiments were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Compagny (France). Cytochrome c was of type III and derived from horse heart.

Densitometric analysis

CO staining was measured by densitometry on a BIO-COM computer-assisted image analysis system (Les Ulis, France), in which optical density readings were converted by means of the standards into enzymatic activity in mol/(min × g of tissue). An entire mouse brain could be observed and sampled on a series of two slides, 15-18 sections per slide corresponding to sequential coronal planes at 250-350 m. The brain regions were identified with the Franklin and Paxinos' mouse atlas (1997). For each region, multiple optical density readings (10-50) were made by a single investigator under blinded conditions at the same level in all brains, at magnifications ranging from 20 to l00×, depending on the heterogeneity of the tissue and the level of precision necessary for each measurement, from regional to cellular. To avoid contamination of adjacent structures and to obtain an homogeneous evaluation, measures with the same surface area for every site were obtained for each animal (Reader and Strazielle, 1999).

Brain pathology detection

Adjacent brain slides, stained with a 0.5% cresyl violet solution, were used to detect possible histologic atrophy in transgenic mice: optical density estimating cell density and surface area were evaluated on the computer-assisted image analysis system in all the regions showing CO activity changes. In order to render the cell density estimation homogeneous, the optical density measures were performed as previously described for CO activity labelling and were reported, in each animal, to the optical density value of the cerebellar granular cell layer which represented the most intense stained region in the entire brain and where no dif-ference appeared in the two groups of animals. In addition, since Purkinje cells are the only source of cerebellar cortical afferents to the deep nuclei, cell counting was performed in Crus I, an arbitrarily chosen cerebellar lobule.

Neuronal degeneration was detected on a new series of sections from each brain by using Fluoro-Jade B according to a protocol previously described by Schmued and Hopkins (2000). After an overnight 10% buffered formalin fixation, the sections were rinsed in distilled water and immersed in a solution containing 1% sodium hydroxyde in 80% alcohol for 5 min followed by 2 min immersions in 70% alcohol and distilled water. The slides were then transfered to a 0.06% potassium permanganate solution for 10 min, washed in distilled water, and incubated in a 0.0004% Fluoro-Jade B solution (Histochem, Jefferson, AR, USA commercialized in France by ASD, Evry) for 20 min. Once staining was complete, the slides were washed on three 1 min rinses in distilled water, thoroughly dried on a hot plate, immersed in xylene for 2 min, and coverslipped using DPX mounting media. The slides were evaluated under fluorescent (FITC) microscopy Fig. 1. Demonstration of C99 expression in the brain and muscle of 13-month-old Tg13592 mice. Overexpressed C99 in the transgenic mice was detected by Western blotting using the 994B antibody raised against the 39 carboxy-terminal residue of ␤APP. For comparison, control C57BL/6J mice were used. C99 was detected as the ∼13 kd fragment in brain and muscle of transgenic mice but not control mice.

Statistical analysis

The unpaired t-test was used for intergroup comparisons. As in any study comprising a cartography of multiple brain regions, false positive results are always possible. To minimize this possibility, the required alpha level was raised to P = 0.01.

Results

C99 expression in muscle and brain

Western blotting confirmed C99 expression in brain and muscle of Tg13592 mice. By using the 994B antibody, ∼13 kd fragments of ␤APP were observed in brain and muscle of transgenic but not control mice (Fig. 1). As previously reported (Fukuchi et al., 1998), since the 6E10 antibody raised against amino acid residue 1-16 of A␤ detected the ∼13 kd fragment as well, these results indicate that the ∼13 kd fragment corresponds to C99.

CO activity in brain

Despite the absence of A␤ plaques, the insertion of the human ␤APP-C99 transgene in mice resulted in regionally-selective changes of brain metabolism (Tables 1-5). In brain areas where the groups differed, the CO activity of Tg13592 mice was always higher than that of non-transgenic controls.

Among cerebral cortical structures (Table 1), the CO activity of Tg13592 mice was increased in the pre-infralimbic region, posterior frontal eyefield (t(32) = 3.28, P < 0.01), and auditory area of the temporal lobe (t(28) = 2.81, P < 0.01). In contrast, CO activity was unchanged in hippocampus (total structure and individual layers), amygdala (total structure and five subnuclei), and olfactory system (P > 0.01, Table 2). The only telencephalic area closely related to the hippocampus and with elevated CO activity was the medial septum (t(31) = 3.36, P < 0.01).

Intergroup differences in CO activity were more prevalent in thalamus (Table 3). Several subregions were affected, including laterodorsal (t(34) = 3.22, P < 0.01), ventromedial (t(32) = 3.1, P < 0.01), midline (t(29) = 3.14, P < 0.01), intralaminar (t(34) = 3.24, P < 0.01), submedial (t(35) = 2.8, P < 0.01), and reticular (t(30) = 3.0, P < 0.01) nuclei. However, the groups did not differ in most brainstem regions (Table 4), with the exception of cerebellar-related areas. As seen in Table 5, the CO activity of Tg13592 mice was enhanced in the deep cerebellar nuclei (Fig. 2), namely the fastigial (t(32) = 2.89, P < 0.0l) and the interpositus (t(35) = 2.82, P < 0.01). This effect was accompanied by increased enzymatic activity in two cerebellar efferent  regions (Table 4): the lateral vestibular (t(35) = 3.01, P < 0.01) and the magnocellular red (t(27) = 3.14, P < 0.01) nuclei. In the latter (Fig. 3), CO activity was augmented at extracellular (t(35) = 3.38, P < 0.01) and intracellular (t(35) = 3.85, P < 0.001) subregions. There were no intergroup differences in cranial nerve nuclei and various subdivisions of the spinal cord (data not shown).

Regional brain pathology

Gross examination of those brain regions affected in terms of regional brain metabolism revealed no detectable atrophy. Optical density readings indicated no altered cell density in those regions (Table 6). Moreover, the surface areas remained unchanged in the same regions (data not shown), except that this evaluation was possible only for the entire thalamus and not for the individual nuclei. Fluoro-Jade B staining, marker of degenerating neuronal fibers and perikaryons, revealed rare to weak fluorescent fibers in the dorsal nuclei of the thalamus and in the cerebellar granular cell layer and deep nuclei of the transgenic mice, whereas no staining was observed in controls. However, Purkinje cell counting in the Crus I lobule at a length of 300 m was not significantly different between the two groups (70.25 ± 2.0 and 65.35 ± 2.1 cells for control and transgenic mice, respectively). 

CO activity in muscle

The amyloid plaques present in leg muscle were not discernable in CO-stained sections. The dark fibers of skeletal    muscle were easily distinguished from light fibers on the basis of staining intensity (Fig. 4). By comparison to C57BL/6 controls, the CO activity of the dark fibers of leg muscle was slightly increased in Tg13592 mice, of borderline sig- nificance according to our strict criteria (t(34) = 2.58, P = 0.014). There were no intergroup differences in the light fibers of leg muscle or in heart (P > 0.01, Table 7).

Discussion

Brain

In the Tg13592 mouse model, A␤ fibrils do not accumulate in brain despite 3-5-fold overexpression of the ␤APP-C99 fragment in plasma (Fukuchi et al., 1996). This model therefore offers the opportunity of examining the role of ␤APP-C99 overexpression in brain independently of neuritic A␤ plaques. Immunohistological staining of a 39 amino acid sequence of the C99-fragment has shown ␤APP-C99 overexpression in specific brain regions, particularly the dorsal nuclei of the thalamus and Purkinje cells (unpublished data). In cell cultures and cultured neuronal cell transplantation, this fragment possesses neurotoxic properties (Neve et al., 1992;Fukuchi et al., 1992Fukuchi et al., , 1994) ) and may therefore constitute a direct cause of the phenotype of the transgenic mice. Despite the absence of Fluoro-Jade B positive perikarya and histologic atrophy, spatial learning deficits and hypoactivity were observed in Tg13592 mice relative to non-transgenic controls (Lalonde et al., 2002), suggesting a deleterious role of human ␤APP-C99 overexpression in mouse brain.

In contrast to the diminished metabolic activity found in demented patients (Kish et al., 1992(Kish et al., , 1999;;Pettegrew et al., 1994;Ibanez et al., 1998;de la Torre, 2000;Johnson and Albert, 2000;Valla et al., 2001), CO cartography in the Tgl3592 model showed regionally selective increases in enzymatic labelling. A similar pattern was revealed in ␤APP 751 SWE (TgAPP23) transgenic mice with A␤ plaques (Strazielle et al., 2003). Moreover, fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was increased in certain neocortical regions of ␤APP/IND (TgPDAPP) transgenic mice with A␤ plaques (Reiman et al., 2000). These results may be attributable to elevated excitatory neurotransmission, as selective degeneration of inhibitory GABAergic cells augmented CO activity in specific anatomical pathways of a cerebellar mutant, namely Grid2 Lc (Strazielle et al., 1998). Relative to human dementia, the Tg13592 mouse model appears to mimick an early stage of pathology, but it remains to be determined whether or not hypermetabolism characterizes prodromal Alzheimer's disease. It is interesting to note that glucose consumption of Alzheimer patients performing behavioral tasks was increased relative to age-matched controls in mild but not in severe dementia (Rapoport, 1999).

On one hand, the affected brain regions in the Tg13592 model were not those primarily affected in Alzheimer's disease in terms of A␤ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, namely the medial temporal lobe and neocortex (Braak and Braak, 1999;Selkoe, 1999). For example, CO activity was unchanged in hippocampus, amygdala, and most neocortical regions. On the other, CO activity was upregulated in brain regions anatomically connected to the medial temporal lobe, for example: 1) the medial septum, source of cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus (Butcher, 1995) and part of the basal forebrain system susceptible to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and directly implicated in memory functions (Coyle et al., 1983), as well as 2) laterodorsal, midline, and submedial thalamic nuclei, together with pre-infralimbic cortex (Amaral and Witter, 1995;Price, 1995). Midline, intralaminar, ventromedial, and reticular thalamic nuclei were also affected, each involved in cerebral activation and emotional reactivity (Price, 1995).

The hypermetabolism in diencephalic areas may be responsible for the increased CO staining detected in posterior frontal eyefield and temporal auditory cortex of Tg13592 mice, as these areas receive direct midline and intralaminar projections (Price, 1995).

The question arises as to the functional impact of elevated CO activity. One possibility is that hypermetabolic neurons are dysfunctional and responsible at least in part for the behavioral deficits found in Tg13592 mice (Lalonde et al., 2002). Such results have been previously observed in mice with cerebellar degeneration (Strazielle et al., 1998). Metabolic alterations in medial septum, prelimbic area, and frontal eyefield may be involved in the spatial orientation deficits found in Tg13592 mice (Lalonde et al., 2002). Likewise, metabolic alterations in diencephalic regions and medial septum may be involved in the hypoactivity seen in Tg13592 mice. However, linear correlations between CO activity of these regions and spatial learning in the Tg13592 group were not significant. A second viewpoint is that elevated CO activity is a compensatory action that minimizes brain disturbances caused by ␤APP-C99 overexpression. The positive correlation between CO staining in the midline thalamic nuclei and motor activity is concordant with this hypothesis.

A few brain regions below the diencephalon were also affected in Tg13592 mice, namely the deep cerebellar nuclei (fastigial and interpositus), the lateral vestibular nucleus, and the magnocellular red nucleus (at intra-and extracellular levels). We have found C99 overexpression only in Purkinje and not in other cells of the cerebellar cortex (unpublished data). Because the altered regions receive cerebellar cortical input (Rubertone et al., 1995;Ruigrok and Cella, 1995) and are involved in balance, equilibrium, and sensorimotor coordination (Lalonde and Strazielle, 1999), the regional metabolic changes observed may result directly from transgene expression. The CO activity changes in Grid2 Lc mice with Purkinje cell degeneration were also characterized by activation of deep cerebellar nuclei, the lateral vestibular nucleus, and the magnocellular red nucleus (Strazielle et al., 1998). Although weak, some Fluoro-Jade B positive fibers were observed in the cerebellar granular layer and deep nuclei of the transgenic mice, possibly indicating synaptic changes. Although the vestibulo-cerebellar system is relatively plaque-free in Alzheimer's disease, Purkinje cell number (Sjobeck and Englund, 2001) and synapses (Baloyannis et al., 2000) were reduced in number. The functional impact of the metabolic alteration in the lateral vestibular nucleus is underlined by its positive linear correlation with motor activity. Once again, this result is concordant with the hypothesis that CO activation is favorable to behavioral outcome, as a compensatory action in the early stage of degeneration.

Muscle

Patients with inclusion-body myopathy are characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, accompanied with vacuolation and A␤ accumulation inside muscle fibers (Askanas et al., 1994(Askanas et al., , 1998;;Askanas and Engel, 1998), CO-deprived muscle fibers (Jansson et al., 2000), and damage to axons and myelin sheats of peripheral nerves (Hermanns et al., 2000). A direct role of mitochondria in the pathogenesis and progression of myopathies in some patients is probable as a result of mtDNA mutations (Muller-Hocker, 1990;Oldfors et al., 1993;Askanas et al., 1996;Lodi et al., 1998).

The Tg13592 model serves as an hIBM model on the basis of A␤ accumulation in skeletal muscle (Fukuchi et al., 1998) and hypoactivity (Lalonde et al., 2002). However, unlike human myopathy, there was no evidence of CO-deprived muscle fibers in this model. Instead, CO activity was selectively increased in the dark fibers of skeletal muscle involved in tonic muscle activity. The elevated CO staining in dark fibers was positively correlated with motor activity levels (Lalonde et al., 2002). In a similar manner to midline thalamus and lateral vestibular nucleus, this result favors the hypothesis that hypermetabolic muscle fibers is a compensatory response for counteracting hypoactivity. This compensatory action may be responsible for the lack of muscle weakness in home-cage behavior as well wire suspension and rotorod tests seen in this model (Lalonde et al., 2002). The hypermetabolic activity in muscle may also be secondary to brain alterations, in particular the cerebellum and related areas involved in tonic muscle control. In other respects, the increased CO activity in A␤ plaque-filled muscle is parallel to the augmented CO activity seen in brain, although the latter is plaque-free. The increased CO activity in muscle is reminiscent of the augmented CO activity and fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in transgenic models with A␤ plaques in brain (Nagy et al., 1999;Reiman et al., 2000;Strazielle et al., 2003). In addition to an increased functional demand on surviving muscular fibers as a consequence of muscle pathology, it is possible that the hypermetabolism is a precursor sign of eventual hypometabolism and cell death. One may hypothesize that hypermetabolism constitutes an attempt by the cell to preserve normal function, but that eventually reserves are depleted to the extent that compensatory responses are no longer possible. Additional studies must be undertaken in order to define the age-dependency of the metabolic alterations in mouse models with plaque deposition in brain and muscle and whether these are associated with cell stress mechanisms, apoptic/necrotic predegenerative processes, and synaptic losses.
