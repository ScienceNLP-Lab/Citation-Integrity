Accumulation of amyloid-b protein in exocrine glands of transgenic mice overexpressing a carboxyl terminal portion of amyloid protein precursor

Amyloid-b protein (Ab) and its precursor (bPP) play important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and inclusion-body myositis. In humans, Ab deposits are found in brain, skeletal muscle, and skin. Therefore, we have investigated possible Ab deposits in multiple tissues of two transgenic mouse lines overexpressing the signal plus Ab-bearing 99-amino acid carboxyl terminal sequences of bPP under the control of a cytomegalovirus enhancer/b-actin promoter. One of the lines developed Ab-immunoreactive intracellular deposits consistently in the pancreas and lacrimal gland, and occasionally in gastric, DeSteno's, and lingual glands. Although the Ab deposits increased during ageing and degenerative changes of the tissues were observed, little or no extracellular Ab deposits were observed up to the age of 25 months. These lines of transgenic mice are useful for studying the molecular mechanisms of development and clearance of intracellular Ab deposits.

Pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) are neuro®brillary tangles, mainly composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, and deposits of aggregated amyloid-b protein (Ab) in neuritic plaques and cerebral vessels in brain. Severe loss of large neurones in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, the hippocampus, and the cortex is also characteristic of AD. Ab consisting of 39±43 amino acids is derived from a larger transmembrane glycoprotein, b-amyloid protein precursor (bPP). bPP undergoes several proteolytic pathways by several proteases, designated a-, b-, and g-secretases. a-secretase cleaves bPP between residues 16 and 17 of Ab releasing a soluble form of bPP (Esch et al. 1990). This pathway is thought to be nonamyloidogenic because intact Ab is not produced. Generation of Ab requires cleavage of bPP by b-and g-secretase at the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of Ab, respectively. Important roles of Ab and bPP in the pathogenesis of AD are underscored by discoveries of missense mutations in the gene encoding bPP in a small subset of early onset familial AD (Hardy 1992). Additionally, causative mutations found in the presenilin-1 and -2 genes of most patients with early onset familial AD increase production of highly amyloidogenic Ab consisting of 42 amino acids (Borchelt et al. 1996;Duff et al. 1996;Scheuner et al. 1996;Citron et al. 1997;Xia et al. 1997). Thus, several distinct mutations found in familial AD seem to cause a common pathological cascade of b-amyloidosis in the human brain. Furthermore, Ab accumulation in skeletal muscle is thought to play an important role in the development of inclusion-body myosistis and myopathies (IBM) (Askanas & Engel 1998).

Overexpression of the mutant forms of bPP in transgenic mice using neurone speci®c promoters leads to extracellular b-amyloid deposits in mouse brain (Games et al. 1995;Hsiao et al. 1996), while overexpression of the signal plus Ab-bearing 99-amino acid carboxyl terminal sequences (SbC) of bPP in transgenic mice using a cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/b-actin promoter causes deposition of intracellular Ab aggregates in pancreas (Kawarabayashi et al. 1996) and skeletal muscle (Fukuchi et al. 1996(Fukuchi et al. , 1998;;Jin et al. 1998). The signal sequence was added so that the SbC would be transported to the cell membrane via the endoplasmic reticulum. Since the CMV enhancer/ b-actin promoter is expected to be highly active in many tissues, we have further investigated possible accumulation of Ab in multiple tissues from two lines of transgenic mice overexpressing SbC (mouse lines, 11430 and 13592) (Fukuchi et al. 1996(Fukuchi et al. , 1998)). We found Ab-immunoreactive deposits in several exocrine glands of 13592 mice. Particularly, these deposits were consistently observed in lacrimal gland and pancreas of 13592 mice. Although Ab deposition resulted in degeneration of such glands, Ab deposits appeared to be exclusively intracellular.

Materials and methods

Transgenic mice

The establishment and propagation of the transgenic mouse lines, 13592 and 11430, has been described previously (Fukuchi et al. 1996(Fukuchi et al. , 1998)). All of the transgenic mice used in this study had been backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice more than ®ve generations (B6.13592[N6 to N8] and B6.11430 [N8]) (Silver 1995). For simplicity, these two lines are hereafter referred to as 13592 and 11430. Segregation of the transgene was determined by Southern blot analysis using cDNA for SbC as described before (Fukuchi et al. 1996). We previously reported that the 13592 and 11430 mice had approximately ®ve and three copies of the transgene, respectively. Non-transgenic C57BL/6J mice were used as controls. Mice were monitored for the presence of murine pathogens by a comprehensive battery of virus serologies, bacterial cultures, endo-and ectoparasite examinations, and histopathology of all major organs, as described previously (Faulkner et al. 1995). All mice were consistently negative for pathogens by these tests.

Northern blot analysis

Northern blot analysis was used to determine levels of mRNA produced from the SbC transgene. Two mice were sacri®ced at 3 months of age from each of the 13592,11430, and nontransgenic C57BL/6J strains at 3 months of age with intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital injection for the collection of tissues. Total RNA was extracted from mouse tissues using Trizol reagents (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-®ve mg of total RNA from each tissue were electrophoresed thorough a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, followed by capillary transfer to a nylon membrane. A human bPP cDNA probe (bp 901±2851) (Fukuchi et al. 1992) was radiolabeled with 32 P dCTP to a speci®c activity of 4 or 6 ´10 8 cpm/mg using a random primed labelling kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The membranes were hybridized for 20 h at 42 8C in 50% formamide 5 ŚSC (1 ´SSC 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and 100 mg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. After hybridization, the membranes underwent two 30 minute washings at 65 8C in 0.25 ´SSC containing 0.25% SDS. The membranes were then exposed to Kodak XAR ®lm with enhancer screens at À80 8C for 4 h. The relative levels of mRNA expression were determined by densitometric scanning (the Bio-Rad Model GS-670 densitometer and Molecular Analyst TM /PC software). Equal loading of the RNA samples was con®rmed by probing the stripped membranes with cDNAs for b-actin and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase).

Western blot analysis

Four mice between 3 and 5 months old from each of the 13592,11430, and nontransgenic C57BL/6J strains were used to determine the steady state levels of SbC expression in the pancreas, muscle, and lacrimal gland by western blot analysis. The tissues were homogenized in 2 ´Laemmli buffer (1´ 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromophenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and sheared with 26-gauge needles. Protein concentration was determined by Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Fifty mg of protein for each sample were applied to a 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electrotransferred to polyvinylidine di¯uoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% nonfat dried milk (w/v), 0.02% sodium azide, and 0.02% Tween 20, incubated at 4 8C for 16 h with the 994B antibody and immunostained with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The 994B antibody was developed against the 39 carboxyl-terminal residue of bPP (Fukuchi et al. 1998). The relative concentration of the protein was determined by densitometric scanning. Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis.

Immunocytochemistry and thio¯avin staining

The following mice were used for immunocytochemical and histochemical analyses: (1) 10 3-to 6-month-old, 21 7-to 12-month-old, six 13-to 18-month-old, and eight 19-to 24-month-old 13592 mice; (2) two 15-month-old, two 22-month-old, two 24-month-old, and one 25-monthold 11430 mice; (3) Six 15-month-old nontransgenic C57BL/6J mice. Mice were killed by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital. Tissues were removed, ®xed in 10% formaldehyde: 90% alcohol, embedded in paraf®n and sectioned at 5 mm for immunocytochemistry and 10 mm for thio¯avin S and T staining. Sections were then subjected to the avidin±biotin immunoperoxidase method to detect SbC and its derivatives using Vectastain ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA). Endogenous peroxidase was eliminated by treatment with 3% H 2 O 2 for 30 min after deparaf®nization of the sections. After washing with distilled water, sections were treated with 88% formic acid and rinsed with water and 0.1 M Tris-saline (TBS) (pH 7.4). Sections were blocked with 5±15% goat serum in TBS for 60 min at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies in 0.1 M TBS containing 5±15% serum (goat serum for rabbit antibodies, horse serum for mouse monoclonal antibodies) for 16 h at 4 8C. Sections were rinsed in 0.1 M TBS containing 1% serum and incubated with appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies for 60 min at room temperature. After washing, sections were incubated with Vectastain ABC reagent for 60 min at room temperature. Peroxidase activity was detected by treatment with 3,3 H -diaminobenzidine. Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. Antibodies used for immunocytochemistry were 6E10 (1 mg IgG/ml; a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against amino acid 1±16 of Ab; Senetek, Maryland Heights, MO, USA), 4G8 (0.5 mg IgG/ml; a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against amino acid resides 17±24 of Ab; Senetek), two rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Ab (anti-b-amyloid peptide, 1 : 200 working dilution, Zymed, San Francisco, CA, USA; anti-b-amyloid (1±40), 1 : 250 working dilution, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 994B (1 : 1000). Tissues also were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for the evaluation of general histology and with thio¯avin S and T for the detection of amyloid. For each immuno-and thio¯avin staining, prefrontal cortex tissues from patients with Alzheimer disease were used as positive controls.

Electron microscopy of 13592 pancreas and lacrimal gland

Tissues from the following mice were evaluated by electron microscopy: three 13592 mice aged 17±24 months, two 11430 mice aged 24±25 months, and one C57BL/6 mouse aged 15 months. The pancreas and lacrimal glands (intra-and exorbital) were removed from the mice and ®xed with cold 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Thin sections (0.1 mm thick, embedded in epon) were prepared and examined in a Hitachi 7000 transmission electron microscope (TEM) at an accelerating voltage of 75 kV.

Results

Northern blot analysis

By northern blot analysis, 1.06 kb mRNA from the SbC transgene was detected in the pancreas, muscle, and exorbital lacrimal glands of both 11430 and 13592 transgenic mice but not in the control nontransgenic tissues (Figure 1a). Endogenous bPP mRNA (3.2 kb) was not detected using human bPP cDNA as a probe under the hybridization and washing conditions used. The levels of mRNA in the muscle, pancreas, and exorbital lacrimal glands of the 13592 mice were approximately 3, 2.5, and 12 times higher than those of the 11430 mice, respectively. Among the tissues, the muscle appeared to have the highest level of SbC mRNA expression followed by the lacrimal glands and pancreas for the 13592 mice.

Western blot analysis

Using 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and the 994B antibody, 9±14 kDa carboxyl-terminal fragments of bPP were observed in the pancreas, muscle, and lacrimal glands of both 11430 and 13592 transgenic mice but not in control nontransgenic mice (Figure 1b). The amounts of the 9±14 kDa fragments in the muscle and lacrimal glands of the 13592 mice were 6 6 1.0 (mean 6 SD) and Amyloid deposition in transgenic mice q 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, International Journal of Experimental Pathology, 81, 231±239 10 6 3.3 times greater than those of the 11430 mice, respectively. The amount of the 9±14 kDa fragments in 13592 pancreas was not signi®cantly higher than that in 11430 pancreas (1.2 6 0.2 times, P 0.08). The amount of the 9±14 kDa fragments in 13592 pancreas was higher than that in 13592 lacrimal glands (1.9 6 0.5 times, P 0.004) while that in 13592 pancreas was not signi®cantly different from that in 13592 muscle (P 0.09). The amount of the 9±14 kDa fragments in the 11430 pancreas was 1.6 6 0.4 times greater than that in the 13592 lacrimal glands (P 0.009).

The 994B-immunoreactive bands greater than 14 kDa are presumably polymeric forms of the carboxyl-terminal fragments of bPP as previously reported (Ohman et al. 1996).

Immunocytochemistry

In order to investigate accumulation of Ab and/or SbC, immunocytochemical analyses were performed using antibodies against Ab (6E10, 4G8, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies). Ab-immunoreactive granular to globular deposits consistently occurred within acinar cells in the pancreas of 13592 mice older than 6 months (Figure 2a and Table 1). Fifty percent of 13592 mice younger than 7 months had Ab-immunoreactive deposits. Although the number of cells containing the deposits and the degree of Ab-immunoreactivity varied greatly between mice, such deposits appeared to increase and sometimes occupy the whole cytoplasm during ageing. No obvious Ab-immunoreactive deposit, however, was extracellularly found in 13592 pancreas. C57BL/6J and 11430 mice did not develop Ab-immunoreactive deposits in pancreas. Such Ab-immunoreactivity was also found in cytoplasm of both intraorbital and exorbital lacrimal gland cells in all 13592 mice examined (older than 2 months, Figure 2c±d, and Table 1). No Ab-immunoreactive deposit in lacrimal gland was found in 11430 Figure 2. Ab-immunoreactive deposits in exocrine glands of 13592 mice. The pancreas and head of 13592 mice were stained with various antibodies using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method. (a) Ab-immunoreactive granular or globular deposits detected by the 4G8 antibody within acinar cells of a 7-month-old 13592 mouse; (b) A section adjacent to (a) was stained with the 994B antibody. The staining is found in the cytoplasm of acinar cells but is diffuse and less intense compared to (a); (c) Ab-immunoreactive deposits visualized by the 6E10 antibody are patchy in this exorbital lacrimal gland from a 3-month-old 13592 mouse; (d) Ab-immunoreactive granular or globular deposits detected by the 6E10 antibody in the intraorbital lacrimal gland of a 11-month-old 13592 mouse; (e) When stained with the 994B antibody, the cytoplasmic staining of a lacrimal gland from a 22-month-old 13592 mouse appears to be diffuse and lighter compared to that stained with antibodies against Ab, such as 6E10 and 4G8; f-h are Ab-immunoreactive deposits in (f) the DeSteno's gland of a 18-month-old 13592 mouse stained with the 6E10 antibody (g) the mucus glands in the tongue of a 11-month-old 13592 mouse stained with the 6E10 antibody, and (h) the gastric gland of a 24-month-old 13592 mouse stained with 4G8 antibody. Scale bars, 65 mm (a, b, and d), 205 mm (c), 50 mm (e and f), 75 mm (g) and 120 mm (h). and C57BL/6 mice except for the intra-and exorbital lacrimal glands of one 24-month-old 11430 mouse, which showed a similar Ab-immunoreactivity. Similar Ab-immunoreactivities were also found in DeSteno's gland (lateral nasal gland) (Figure 2f) and tongue mucous gland (Figure 2g) in some of 13592 mice, but not in 11430 and C57BL/6 mice. Most of the cells showing Ab-immunoreactivity also were stained with the 994B antibody against the carboxyl-terminus of bPP. The staining patterns with the 994B antibody, however, were more dispersed within cytoplasm and less granular compared to those with the antibodies against Ab (Figure 2b,e). Diffuse, rarely granular, cytoplasmic staining with the antibodies against both Ab and the carboxyl-terminus of bPP also was found in chief cells deep in the gastric glands of 13592 mice, but not in 11430 or C57BL/6J mice (Figure 2h).

Other than the exocrine glands described above and the skeletal muscle reported previously (Fukuchi et al. 1998), Ab-immunoreactivity with much lesser intensity was occasionally found in the cytoplasm of brain neurones in 13592 mice but not in 11430 mice (not shown). In 13592 mice, the degree of Ab-immunoreactivity was greatest in the pancreas and skeletal muscle, followed by the other exocrine glands, and slightest in the brain neurones. No other tissues showed Ab-immunoreactivity in 13592 mice.

Thio¯avin staining and electron microscopy

Thio¯avin-S and -T staining and TEM were performed to study amyloid ®bril formation in the pancreas and lacrimal glands. Clusters of amyloid-like ,10 nm ®brils were found enclosed by membranes in the cytoplasm of pancreatic acinar cells of 13592 mice (Figure 3a) but not in the lacrimal glands. It was not uncommon to ®nd cells having cytoplasm ®lled with the amyloid ®brils and showing signs of degeneration in 13592 pancreas. Two 24-month-old 13952 mice showed loss of acinar cells and ®brotic changes in the pancreas, but extracellular amyloid deposits were seldom found (Figure 3b). Using TEM, no amyloid-like ®brils were found in the pancreas and lacrimal glands from 11430 and C57BL/6J mice. Consistent with the TEM results, only the pancreas from 13592 mice was positive for thio¯avin-S and -T staining (Figure 3c), but positive staining was not found in lacrimal glands from 13592 mice. Neither the lacrimal gland nor the pancreas from 11430 and C57BL/6J mice showed positive thio¯avin-T or -S staining.

Discussion

Lines of transgenic mice bearing the SbC construct under the control of a CMV enhancer/b-actin promoter highly produced 9±14 kDa carboxyl-terminal fragments of bPP in multiple tissues. One of the transgenic lines (13592) developed accumulations of overexpressed protein derivatives in several exocrine glands including lacrimal gland and pancreatic acinar cells. The accumulation was immunocytochemically detectable using antibodies against part of bPP and Ab. Except for gastric glands, the immunostaining patterns visualized by antibodies against Ab and a carboxyl-terminus of bPP were distinct: granular or globular staining by two mouse monoclonal and two rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Ab, and diffuse light staining by one rabbit polyclonal antibody against a carboxyl terminus of bPP. Such distinct staining patterns suggest that Ab itself accumulated within one or more subcellular compartments after cleavage of the carboxyl terminus of bPP (SbC) by g-secretase. Although the true identity of the Abimmunoreactive deposits remains to be determined, this interpretation is consistent with the previous observation that Ab-immunoreactive deposits are mostly composed of Ab (Fukuchi et al. 1998;Shoji et al. 1998). Kawarabayashi et al. (1996) also established transgenic mice bearing a SbC construct similar to ours and reported that Ab amyloid ®brils accumulated within lysosomes of pancreatic acinar cells in their transgenic mice. It is most likely that the Ab-immunoreactive deposits in 13592 mice accumulated in lysosomes of pancreatic acinar cells because of close similarities between DNA constructs, as well as immunocytochemical and TEM ®ndings in the two transgenic mice.

Other than pancreas, however, no Ab-immunoreactive deposit was reported to be found in their transgenic mice. Some of the phenotypic discrepancies between 11430

and 13592 mice such as Ab-immunoreactive deposits in the lacrimal gland and skeletal muscle can be attributed to differences in levels of SbC expression between the two transgenic lines due to differences in copy numbers of the SbC transgene and their integration sites. The level of SbC expression in 11430 pancreas was much higher than that in 13592 lacrimal gland and was not signi®cantly different from that in 13592 pancreas. Ab-immunoreactive deposits were readily detectable in 13592 pancreas and lacrimal gland but no Ab-immunoreactive deposit was found in 11430 pancreas. The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear. However, it is possible that the differences in genetic background between 13592 and 11430 mice in¯uenced development of Ab-immunoreactive deposits in pancreas. Such deposits in pancreas were positive by thio¯avin staining and composed of ,10 nm ®brils. While heavy Ab-immunoreactive deposits were easily detectable in the lacrimal gland of all 13592 mice even at the age of 3 months, amyloid ®brils were not identi®ed in the lacrimal gland by TEM or thio¯avin staining. Tissue speci®c post translational processing, and/or protein traf®cking might have contributed to amyloid ®bril formation and Abimmunoreactivity, since the level of SbC mRNA in 13592 lacrimal gland was similar to that in 13592 pancreas. It also is possible that tissue speci®c molecular chaperons which modulate formation and stability of amyloid ®brils led to the phenotypic differences. Ab-immunoreactive cells in exocrine glands often clustered (Figure 2a, c, g). The molecular basis of this patchy staining is not clear. The possible mechanisms, however, include mosaicism for the SbC transgene, differences in the transgene expression levels due to different subtypes of exocrine cells, differences in available factors which may accelerate or inhibit the accumulation of Ab.

A de®nitive diagnosis of AD depends on brain pathology characterized by abundant neuritic plaques and neuro®brillary tangles (Mckhann et al. 1984). Although low levels of Ab consisting of 42 amino acids in cerebrospinal ¯uid (CSF), high levels of tau in CSF, and an apolipoprotein E e4 allele can increase con®dence to the clinical diagnosis, at present, there is no satisfactory biomarker for diagnosing late-onset and sporadic AD (The Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute of the Alzheimer's Association and the National Institute on Ageing Working Group 1998). Although Ab-immunoreactive deposits in skin had been considered as a useful biomarker (Joachim et al. 1989), substantial overlaps with nondemented elderly control subjects were found (Soininen et al. 1992). Since Ab-immunoreactive deposits were readily detectable in exocrine glands of Amyloid deposition in transgenic mice 13592 mice even at the age of 3 months and since some of the exocrine glands such as lacrimal glands are easily accessible, it is intriguing to determine if possible Abimmunoreactive deposits in exocrine glands can be a diagnostic biomarker for AD. Since bPP is expressed in lacrimal gland and secreted into tears in humans (van Setten et al. 1996), levels of secreted bPP and Ab in tears may also serve as noninvasive biomarkers.

Ab deposits in AD brain occur extracellularly. Recently, however, intracellular Ab and its aggregates have emerged as possible causative agents in the pathogenesis of AD, but they are dif®cult to detect and have not been ascribed a speci®c role in AD brain (Hartmann et al. 1997;Wild-Bode et al. 1997). On the other hand, accumulation of intracellular Ab amyloid ®brils in 13592 pancreas was readily detectable and was associated with degeneration and loss of acinar cells. No extracellular amyloid deposits were observed in 13592 pancreas, suggesting that extracellular amyloid released from degenerating cells was quickly removed by macrophages. Thus, the mechanism of clearing Ab deposits in the pancreas may differ from that in the brain. Since the Ab-immunoreactive deposits are readily detectable in 13592 lacrimal gland and pancreas, these transgenic mice may serve as a unique model system for the investigation of the mechanisms engendering intracellular Ab, its deposition and clearance, which may provide a logical basis for prevention and cure of bamyloidosis in brain (AD) and skeletal muscle (IBM).
