Controlled Studies with High-Dose Intravenous Immunoglobulin in the Treatment of Dermatomyositis, Inclusion Body Myositis, and Polymyositis

There are three major subsets of the inflammatory myopathies: polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), and inclusion-body myositis (IBM). High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin ( M g ) has been tried in controlled clinical trials in patients with DM and IBM but not with PM. In patients with DM that is resistant or partially responsive to conventional therapies, M g was very effective. The treated patients experienced dramatic improvement not only in muscle strength but also of their skin rash. Repeated muscle biopsies with quantitative histologic studies showed the Mg-treated patients had a statistically significant improvement of the muscle cytoarchitecture, with resolution of the aberrant immunopathologic parameters. In two controlled clinical trials conducted in IBM patients, M g showed marginal improvements in muscle strength which were nonsignificant. However, a few IBM patients had a definite clinical improvement with increased activities of daily living, but when analyzed within the entire Mg-treated group, their total gains in muscle strength did not reach statistical significance compared to the placebo-treated group. Of interest is that certain muscle groups in the Mg-treated patients, such as the muscles of swallowing, showed significant improvement compared to those of the placebo-treated patients, implying mild regional effects. In PM, uncontrolled trials have shown improvements in muscle strength, but the controlled clinical trial is still ongoing.

response may be dramatic and, if prudently used, prednisone may have a long-lasting effect with minimal side effects.12 In others, however, the response is mild to moderate, and in still others, the steroid-induced side effects are severe, necessitating the need for other immunosuppressive drugs. Azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporin, and cyclophosphamide, the most commonly used immunosuppressants, offer a mild or at very best a modest benefit, but with considerable toxicity after longterm use. Plasmapheresis is ineffective.13 IBM is almost always unresponsive to steroids or other immunosuppressants. The need for more effective drugs and the encouraging results from pilot and uncontrolled s t u d i e ~~~-~' prompted us to examine whether high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIg), an immunomodulating drug with prohibitive cost but minimal toxicity, has a role in therapyresistant cases. I present data based on the controlled studies we performed at the NIH separately for PM, DM, and IBM.

M g in DM.

Brief description of disease pathogenesis. DM affects the skeletal muscles, resulting in proximal muscle weakness, and the skin, causing a characteristic violaceous rash on the face, chest, knees, back, and the knuckles of the fingers.1-6 Dilated or infarcted capillaries at the base of the fin- * Response to M g or placebo was measured after 3 months of treatment and before crossover to the alternative therapy, the effect of which is shown in figure 1 (see text for details). p = 0.018 (Wilcoxon) for comparison with placebo value. $ p = 0.035 (Wilcoxon) for comparison with placebo value. gernails are frequently present. Muscle biopsy shows endomysial inflammation, which is predominantly perivascular or in the interfascicular septae and around, rather than within, the fascicles. The earliest lesion that precedes inflammation or structural changes in the muscle fibers is deposition of the complement CSb9 membranolytic attack complex (MAC) on the intramuscular ~apillaries.~-~J*J~ This is followed by necrosis and a marked reduction in the number of capillaries per muscle fiber, especially in the perifascicular regions, resulting in ischemia and muscle fiber destruction that often resembles microinfarcts. Cytokines and adhesion molecules participate in the trafficking of sensitized lymphocytes and macrophages from the intramuscular blood vessels to the muscle fibers.l-'j These molecules may also be responsible for upregulation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen expression on the muscle fibers, especially in the perifascicular regions, which are the areas most severely affected by the immunopathologic process. Considering all the aforementioned immune mechanisms, if rVIg is effective in DM, one might expect to see not only clinical benefit but also improvement in the muscle cytoarchitecture, downregulation of cytokines or adhesion molecules, effect on complement activation and MAC formation, and improvement of the muscle microvasculature.

To assess the effect of IVIg in patients with DM, we conducted a doubleblind, placebo-controlled study.18 Patients incompletely responsive to various immunotherapeutic agents or those who had experienced significant side effects from long-term steroid therapy were selected. A total of 15 patients (aged 18-55 years) with biopsy-proven, treatment-resistant DM were randomly assigned to receive IVIg (a total of 2 gkglday) or placebo every month for 3 months, with the option of crossing over to the alternative therapy for 3 more months after a washout period of 1 month. The patients continued to receive prednisone (mean daily dose 25 mg), which remained unchanged for 3 months before and after therapy. Clinical response was gauged by assessing changes in (a) muscle strength, using a modified MRC scale, a wellvalidated scale in the treatment of neuromuscular disorders, (b) scores of neuromuscular symptoms Experience with N I g studies.

538 NEUROLOGY Rl(Suppl5) December 1998 that provide a picture of daily living activities, and (c) rash, using photography under the same lighting conditions. Details of the methodology and scales were previously reported.18 Moreover, histologic and immunopathologic improvement was sought on the basis of quantitative histochemistry and immunopathology performed in repeated muscle biopsies.

Of the 15 patients, eight were assigned to IVIg and seven to placebo. Their scores at randomization and the mean disease duration in years were similar in both groups (table 1).l8 The patients randomized to IVIg had a significant improvement in the scores of muscle strength from a mean of 76.6 ? 5.7 to 84.6 t 4.6, and in the neuromuscular symptoms scores from a mean of 44 -t 8.2 to 51.4 ? 6. In contrast, the seven patients assigned to placebo did not change and their scores remained the same, from 78.6    ments in muscle strength, expressed as MRC and neuromuscular symptom scores, were functionally impressive for individual patients, some of whom were wheelchair bound before therapy and who walked independently or regained full strength after 3 months of M g (figure 1). Of 11 placebo-treated patients, none had major improvement, three had mild improvement, three had no change in their condition, and five worsened (table 2).

The improvement became noticeable about 15 days after the first IVIg infusion, and it was clear and definitive after the second infusion. Two of the responders reached their peak after the second infusion; the rest peaked between the second and third infusions (figure 2). Eight patients had marked improvement of the active violaceous rash or the chronic scaly eruptions on their knuckles, which often preceded or coincided with the improvement of muscle strength. Serum creatine kinase, elevated up to tenfold in seven of the Mg-treated patients, fell by 50% after the first infusion and decreased further or became normalized by the second infusion. Creatine kinase remained elevated, was unchanged, or was increased during placebo, and returned to baseline 6-10 weeks after the IVIg-treated patients crossed over to placebo or the M g infusions were stopped. Overall, the patients who noted major improvement felt that IVIg had an important effect on their daily activities without troublesome adverse effects. The improvement had such an effect on the patients' lifestyle it overshadowed the occurence of aseptic meningitis that developed in two patients.

In subsequent open-label infusions, the benefit of IVIg was also documented in more than 15 patients treated by us or under our supervision in several institutions. The improvement was also documented in one of our open label-treated patients using quantitative muscle strength testing (the maximal voluntary isometric contractions [MVICI), which measures changes in muscle strength in Newtons. 20  patient, the scores improved from 202 Newton at baseline to 358 after the third infusion. She used a cane to walk before therapy but became able to exercise on parallel bars after two or three IVIg infusions. l9 Maintenance and chronic use. The improvement in strength was short-lived, not lasting more than  4-8 weeks. Most of the original patients for whom we have follow up data or communication since the initial study 6 years ago continue to receive M g and are responding to various degrees. Some patients need M g less frequently and continue to maintain their improvement in conjunction with low-dose steroids. Two patients who were wheelchair bound before therapy and received M g for 2 years have maintained normal strength without any drugs for 3-5 years. Others need M g every 3-4 weeks to maintain excellent response, and still others continue to improve on 4-6-week regimens, although the improvement is not as impressive as initially, presumably due to further progression of the disease or to a diminished response to M g therapy. In several patients, we were able to lower the prednisone and keep only a low maintenance dose. It is our experience that low-dose prednisone is helpful and appears to enhance the benefit of IVIg. We have also noted that patients who had become unresponsive to steroids may respond again to prednisone after a few infusions with M g . The phenomenon of restored responsiveness to steroids is interesting and requires further study, not only in DM but also in CIDP, in which it has also been noted. (Dalakas MC, unpublished observations).

Histopathologic and immunohistochemical changes in the repeated muscle biopsies. In patients who showed major improvement, repeat open muscle biopsies on the biceps muscle opposite the one used for the pretreatment biopsy was performed 15 days after the last M g infusion. Before the code was broken, the pretreatment biopsies were processed for muscle enzyme histochemistry and immunocytochemistry with an immunoperoxidase technique, using antibodies against MHC-I, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-I (ICAM-I), Leu-19 (to assess the regenerating muscle fibers), and various lymphocyte subsets15 and TGF-fl protein and mRNA. Moreover, the capillaries were visualized by immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase staining, using the lectin Ulex eu- ropaeus, which stains capillary endothelial c e l l ~. ~* J ~ In five randomly selected perifascicular regions at a low, original X40 magnification, each region corresponding to a large 6.4 X lo4 pm2 surface area, we counted the number of capillaries and their diameter, as well as the number of muscle fibers and their diameter, and calculated the ratio of muscle fiber to capillaries (table 3). The posttreatment biopsy measurements were compared not only to the pretreatment biopsies but also t o five biopsies from patients with limb-girdle dystrophies that served as disease controls.

Figure 3. Cross-section of muscle biopsies stained for MHC-I before and after N I g therapy shows the marked suppression of MHC-I expression. The increase in the diameter of the muscle fibers, especially in the periphery, is prominent after therapy. The periuascular inflammatory responses seen before, as MHCpositive cells, improved after therapy. Figure 4. Cross-section of representative muscle areas before (top panels) and after therapy (lower panels) stained for Ulex europaeus, which identifies the endothelial cells (see quantification of capillaries in table 1). An increase in the number of capillaries and reduction in fiber diameter is shown after therapy (lower panels) (same magnification for both).

A marked improvement in muscle histology was noted in the repeated biopsies compared with the pre-M g biopsies. As shown in table 3, the mean number of muscle fibers counted in the five regions decreased because of an increase in the muscle fiber diameter, from a mean of 54.0 t 11 km to 71.0 t 15 pm ( p < 0.04) (figure 3). The mean number of capillaries increased and their mean diameter decreased from 11.0 t 3 to 7.4 2 2 (normal 6.5 5 0.1) ( p < 0.01) (table 3; figure 4). The mean ratio of muscle fiber to capillaries also decreased, from 3.4 to 1.5 (normal 1.2), and normalized in three patients (table 3).

Among the main immunologic markers on the repeated biopsy was downregulation of the MHC-I molecule, which was markedly expressed in the pretreatment biopsy in the perifascicular regions, as shown in figure 3. In addition, ICAM-I expression on the surface of some muscle fibers and on the blood vessels was suppressed after IVIg therapy.18 Because ICAM-I, the ligand for LFA-I, was overexpressed on the endothelial cells before therapy, the IVIginduced downregulation of ICAM-I probably had an effect on the exit of activated T cells from the capillaries toward the muscle fibers and might have been responsible for the reduction of inflammatory cells noted in the repeated biopsies. Another effect of IVIg was on TGF-P expression. TGF-P is a pleiotropic cytokine which, in excess, induces chronic inflammation and fibrosis. In the tissues of DM patients, TGF-P is upregulated at both the protein and the mRNA level. After M g , in the repeated muscle biopsies, we noted an impressive downregulation of TGF-P and TGF-P mRNA. Of interest was that this effect was not observed in five repeated muscle biopsies from patients with inclusion body myositis who did not respond to IVIg, as discussed later. The most remarkable improvement in reference to the immunopathogenetic mechanism of DM was the Mg-induced interception of the formation and intramuscular deposition of the MAC, the lytic component of the complement pathway. In the repeat muscle biopsies, the C,bNEO (neoantigen), which is immunecomplex specific, and the MAC could not be detected in the endomysial capillaries (figure 5).20-22 Moreover, in an in uitro assay system of sensitized erythrocytes, the consumption of C, uptake by the patients' sera was suppressed after M g compared to the pretreatment sera.21 As discussed in the mechanism of action of Mg,23 M g inhibited the incorporation of C, into the C, convertase assembly, prevented the formation of C3bNE0 (see figure 3 in ref. 231, and intercepted the formation and deposition of MAC on the endomysial capillaries. Consequently, M g allowed neovascularization to occur and reversal of the ischemic process, as demonstrated by the normalization of the capillaries and the muscle fiber diameter in the repeat muscle biopsies (figure 4).

The effect of M g in intercepting the formation and deposition of MAC in target tissues may be also relevant to other Mg-responsive diseases in which tissue damage is mediated by complement activation and MAC deposition. For example, MAC deposition mediates the destruction not only of the capillaries in DM but also of the myelin sheath in Guillain-Barre syndrome and the acetylcholine receptors in myasthenia gravis, as discussed elsewhere in this issue.

M g in PM.

In PM and IBM, there is evidence not of microangiopathy and muscle ischemia, as in DM, but of an antigen-directed cytotoxicity mediated by cytotoxic T cells.1-8 This conclusion is supported by the presence of CD8+ T cells, which, along with macrophages, initially surround healthy, non-necrotic muscle fibers and eventually invade and destroy. The muscle fibers, either adjacent to or remote from the areas of inflammation, strongly express the MHC class I antigen, which is absent from the sarcolemma of normal muscle fiber^.^-^ Because cytotoxic T cells recognize antigenic targets in association with MHC-I antigen, the primary immunopathologic mechanism in PM and IBM is T-cell-mediated and MHC-I antigen-restricted. The immunopathology is almost identical in both PM and IBM, even though the latter does not respond to immunotherapies.

In uncontrolled studies, M g has been shown to be effective in PM.14J5 However, controlled studies using quantitative muscle strength testing and documentation of the disease with muscle biopsies before therapy have not yet been completed. Such a controlled clinical trial in PM began at the NIH more than 7 years ago, but it has not yet been completed because most patients referred to us as PM-resistant to therapy turn out to have IBM or another disease. Although from the enrolled patients the clinical impression is that M g appears to be helpful in care-S42 NEUROLOGY 51(Suppl5) December 1998 fully selected PM patients, the study code is not yet broken and the results have not been analyzed.

M g in retrovirus-associated PM. Polymyositis (PM) and IBM can be seen in association with HIV and HTLV-I i n f e ~t i o n . ~~-~~

In these conditions, the virus does not infect the muscle but instead triggers a T-cell-mediated inflammatory response, which is immunopathologically identical to the one described in retrovirus-negative PM. 26,27 In three patients whom we have treated in a controlled crossover design, only minimal changes in the patients' strength were noted after M g compared to placebo. Although the series is small, our results do not support any efficacy of IVIg.

M g in IBM. Inclusion-body myositis (IBM) is the most common acquired inflammatory myopathy in patients over the age of 50 years.'-* The condition presents with selective atrophy of forearm flexor muscles, frequent falls, atrophy of the quadricep muscles, and dysphagia. The histologic hallmarks of IBM are basophilic granular inclusions distributed around the edge of slit-like vacuoles (rimmed vacuoles), angulated or round fibers, often in small groups, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions, prominent endomysial inflammation in a pattern identical to that seen in PM, and Congo redor crystal violetpositive amyloid deposits next to the vacuoles.

In an open pilot trial that we conducted, IVIg appeared to be helpful in some patients with IBM because strength improved in some muscle groups after treatment.17 Although the improvement was not dramatic, it made a difference t o the patients' life styles. Another uncontrolled series of patients collected from two or three institutions showed no benefit of Mg. 28 We have since completed a controlled, double-blind study involving 19 patients with IBM.29 Efficacy was assessed by quantitative muscle strength testing and quantification of swallowing function, which is so commonly affected in IBM patients. The study, a 3-month, randomized, crossover trial, was designed similarly to the one described earlier for DM. No statistically significant differences were noted in the strength of the limb muscles between placebo and M g (figure 6). Whether or not the small sample size might have been a factor is unknown. However, regional significant differences were observed in the Mg-randomized patients, especially in the muscles of swallowing, as measured objectively by the ultrasound technique29 (table 4). The nonsignificant effect in the limb muscles compared to the swallowing muscles may be due to the more precise, objective, and reproducible measurement of the swallowing function. Because the test-totest variability with the ultrasound technique that measures the duration of swallowing in seconds is minimal, this technique enables us to capture even minor improvements.

Although in the limb muscles the study did not, overall, establish efficacy of M g , six of 19 IBM pa-  tients (28%) showed a mild improvement in muscle strength (figure 6) which was functionally important for their daily activities. Because, in our experience, IBM patients do not respond to therapies and the disease is incapacitating, even a minor improvement may have a positive impact for some of the patients' functions. Therefore, we conducted a larger study, this time combining IVIg with prednisone. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 37 patients, 17 of whom were randomized to M g plus high-dose steroids and 16 to placebo plus high-dose steroids. 30 The changes in muscle strength were assessed by quantitative muscle strength testing and MRC scale. Preliminary results suggest after three months of treatment, there was no clear benefit in either of the two groups. Minor gains in strength were noted in the Mg-randomized patients but were not significant. Of interest, subjective improvements were noted in 10 of the 17 patients randomized to M g compared to one of 16 randomized to placebo. The repeated muscle biopsies showed a reduction in the T-cell count in both groups, probably related to steroids. No changes in muscle cytoarchitecture, vacuoles, amyloid depositis, or adhesion molecules (N-CAM) were noted. The TGF-P in the muscle remained unchanged at both the protein and the mRNA level. This is in contrast to the TGF-P in DM patients, which was downregulated and correlated with clinical improvement, as discussed above. Although this second study also failed to show efficacy of M g , it seems the use of high dose steroids in patients who already have significant muscular atrophy may have exerted a negative impact and negated possible M g related gains in muscle strength.

The ongoing analysis of the doctor will clarify this issue. Despite these two negative trials, our clinical impression is that a few patients may show transient signs of improvement that are minor and difficult to capture with the methods used but can be clinically significant for the patients' activities and life styles, at least for a period of time. Whether such a mild improvement in a small number of IBM patients justifies a 2-3-month trial with M g remains a matter S44 NEUROLOGY 51(Suppl5) December 1998 of clinical judgment and should be viewed on a caseby-case basis. Safety, age, economics, and the reminder that nothing else (including steroids) offers even minor clinical improvement to IBM patients should be taken into account.
