Caffeine Stimulates Amyloid β-Peptide Release from β-Amyloid Precursor Protein-Transfected HEK293 Cells

Extracellular amyloid ß-peptide (Aß) deposition is a pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease and the aging brain. Intracellular Aß accumulation is observed in the human muscle disease, inclusion body myositis. Aß has been reported to be toxic to neurons through disruption of normal calcium homeostasis. The pathogenic role of Aß in inclusion body myositis is not as clear. Elevation of intracellular calcium following application of calcium ionophore increases the generation of Aß from its precursor protein (ßAPP). A receptor-based mechanism for the increase in Aß production has not been reported to our knowledge. Here, we use caffeine to stimulate ryanodine receptor (RYR)-regulated intracellular calcium release channels and show that internal calcium stores also participate in the genesis of Aß. In cultured HEK293 cells transfected with ßAPP cDNA, caffeine (5-10 mM) significantly increased the release of Aß fourfold compared with control. These actions of caffeine were saturable, modulated by ryanodine, and inhibited by the RYR antagonists ruthenium red and procaine. The calcium reuptake inhibitors thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid potentiated caffeine-stimulated Aß release. NH 4CI

and monensin, agents that alter acidic gradients in intracellular vesicles, abolished both the caffeine and ionophore effects. Immunocytochemical studies showed some correspondence between the distribution patterns of RYR and cellular ßAPP immunoreactivities. The relevance of these findings to Alzheimer's disease and inclusion body myositis is discussed.

ß-Amyloid-laden plaques and vascular deposits are pathologic hallmarks common to Alzheimer' s disease (AD) and the normal aging process. The 4-kDa amybid ß-peptide (Aß) is a secreted 39-42 amino acid peptide by-product of endocytotic and secretory processes (involving unidentified proteases referred to as ßand y-secretases) acting on the ß-amyloid precursor protein (ßAPP) (Haass and Selkoe, 1993). The predominant proteolytic event of ßAPP processing leads to the secretion of a large NH2-terminal ectodomain (ßPP5) (Weidemann et al., 1989;Esch et al., 1990;Sisodia et al., 1990) and retention of a 10-kDa COOHterminal membrane fragment (Selkoe et al., 1988) that is catalyzed by an unknown protease termed a-secretase. The latter scission occurs at Aß position 16, thereby precluding formation of intact Aß (Esch et al., 1990;Oltersdorf et al., 1990), and occurs either at the cell surface or within secretory vesicles targeted for exocytosis (Sisodia et al., 1990;Sambamurti et al., 1992;De Strooper et al., 1993;Haass et al., 1995b). A second trafficking pathway involves the reinternalization of cell surface ßAPP by endosomes that are ultimately targeted to lysosomes (Yamazaki et al., 1995). Constitutive production of Aß from wild-type ßAPP molecules occurs mainly via endocytosis of cell surface-associated ßAPP (Koo and Squazzo, 1994).

Aß deposits also occur in inclusion body myositis (Mendell et al., 1991). However, little information regarding the molecular biogenesis of Aß or of its pathogenic role in this disorder is available.

Calcium homeostasis may play a pivotal role in the neuronal degeneration that occurs in AD and other degenerative disorders (Greenamyre and Young, 1989;Siesjö et al., 1989;Weiss and Choi, 1991), as well as in various myopathic conditions (Wrogemann and Pena, 1976;Bodensteiner and Engel, 1978;Ogawa, 1994). The neurotoxic effects of aggregated Aß on cortical cell cultures (Yankner et al., 1990;Pike et al., 1991) may be mediated by reactive oxygen species, membrane damage, and impairment of ion-motive ATPases (Mark et al., 1995). The resulting loss of calcium homeostasis leads to a potentiation of, or vulnerability to, depolarization-and excitotoxic amino acid-induced calcium influx (Koh et al., 1990;Mattson et al., 1993). Aß toxicity is also abrogated by L-type calcium-channel blockers and metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists that inhibit membrane calcium conductance (Weiss et al., 1994). Calcium influx into human cortical neurons following calcium ionophore A23 187 application causes changes that are reminiscent of the cytoskeletal and tau protein abnormalities in AD (Baudier and Cole, 1987;Mattson et al., 1991). A23 187-induced calcium influx also produces degeneration of myofibrils similar to lesions seen in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (Pestronk et al., 1982).

In addition to the loss of calcium homeostasis subsequent to Aß toxicity, calcium has also been implicated in Aß formation. We previously reported that Aß production was increased approximately threefold in cells transfected with wild-type ßAPP cDNA after exposure to the calcium ionophore A23 187. This effect was dependent upon extracellular calcium and did not involve inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1P 3) or protein kinase C (PKC) (Querfurth and Selkoe, 1994). The muscarinic/ PKC signaling cascade, in fact, decreases use of the amyloidogenic pathway and up-regulates the competing secretory nonamyloidogenic pathway (Nitsch et al., 1992;Hung et al., 1993;Buxbaum et al., 1994;Querfurth and Selkoe, 1994). Together, these observations led us to hypothesize that the ßand y-secretase events and/or the exocytosis necessary for the major production of Aß are modified by calcium-binding proteins or calcium-dependent proteases.

The importance of an "acidic" cellular compartment comprised of endosomes, the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and secretory vesicles in the basal formation of Aß has been demonstrated by using acidotropic agents, such as NH4C1, chloroquine, and the monovalent ionophore, monensin (Caporaso et al., 1992;Shoji et al., 1992;Haass et al., 1993). The vacuolar H + -ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin Al, which alters pH in these organelles (Bowman et al., 1988;Yoshimori et al., 1991), is the only drug other than A23 187 reported consistently to increase Aß production in cells expressing wild-type ßAPP (Haass et al., 1995a).

Calcium ionophores change cytosolic and luminal calcium concentration gradients due to both influx and release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In contrast, ryanodine receptors (RYRs) and 1P3 receptors physiologically regulate calcium mobilization from separate intracellular calcium pools in tissues such as brain (Berridge, 1993). The caffeine-sensitive RYR is a ~560-kDa transmembrane tetrameric calcium release channel in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscle (Imagawa et al., 1987;Fleischer and Inui, 1989) and in the ER of secretory cells and neurons (McPherson and Campbell, 1993). The cardiac muscle type 2 RYR is diffusely distributed throughout brain and is also the predominant brain RYR subtype. Skeletal muscle type 1 RYRs are found in high concentrations in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Brain or type 3 RYRs are expressed in human hippocampus, cortex, and corpus striatum (Stein et al., 1992;Sorrentino and Volpe, 1993). Their mode of activation is likely to involve a calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) phenomenon (McPherson et al., 1991;Ogawa, 1994).

Previously, we used human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells to show that general changes in cytosolic or luminal free calcium concentration ([Ca 2~I~) following application of ionophore influence Aß production. The ßAPP-transfected HEK293 cells used in our studies are a proven model for the chemistry of amyloid production in AD. When transfected with ßAPP carrying the Swedish familial AD double mutation, both the abundant short (amino acids 1-40) and scarce long (amino acids l-42/43) forms of Aß are overproduced, a situation that is duplicated in the plasma and fibroblasts of disease gene carriers (Dovey et al., 1993;Citron et al., 1994;Scheuner et al., 1996). HEK cells transfected with various presenilin 1 (PS 1) gene mutations overexpress the 142 species, a finding that is recapitulated in the brains of PS 1 transgenic mice (Citron et al., 1997). Similar results on in vitro Aß 1 -42 production in other nonneural cell lines transfected with the ßAPP717 mutations were confirmed in vivo on familial AD brains (Suzuki et al., 1994;Tamaoka et al., 1994a). In this report, we extend our previous work by showing that RYR activation in HEK293 cells specifically results in quantitatively similar increases in cumulative Aß secretion and [Ca 24] 1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Reagents and cell culture

Caffeine (Sigma), 0.15 M in Dulbecco' s modified Eagle' s medium (DMEM), was freshly prepared and heated to 42°C prior to use. L-[ 35SlMethionine was stored as a 7.9 mCi/mi stock (EXPRE 35S 35S labeling mix; New England Nuclear, Boston, MA, U.S.A.). Thapsigargin and ryanodine (Molecular Probes) were kept at -20°Cas 10 mM and 15 mM stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Brefeldin A (5 mg/ml stock in DMSO, Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 36 mM. Procaine (1.7 M in DMSO), ruthenium red (13 mM in H 20), cyclopiazonic acid (1.3 mM in DMSO), and monensin (10 mM in DMSO) were purchased from ICN. Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes) was diluted in DMSO to 1 mM before use. HEK293 cells stably transfected with ßAPP695 and ßAPP751 cDNA (Selkoe et al., 1988;Oltersdorf et al., 1990) were grown in DMEM (2 mM CaC12), 10% fetal calf serum to near confluence on 10-cm dishes prior to metabolic labeling.

Antibodies

Polyclonal antibody R1280, raised to synthetic Aß (amino acids 1-40), precipitates "total Aß," which is comprised of both the major secreted Aß and p3 peptides (residues 1-1582 H. W. QUERFURTH respectively) and the longer Aß and p3 species ending at residues 42 or 43. Peptide identities were determined by radiosequencing, and antibody specificity was demonstrated by the absence of reactivity with preabsorbed antibody and preirnmune serum (Haass et al., 1992). Polyclonal antibody C7 is directed against the last 20 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of /3APP and precipitates N'and N'-plus O '-glycosylated full-length ßAPP, as well as a number of COOH-terminal fragments (Podlisny et al., 1991). Dilutions used for inimunoprecipitation were as follows: R1280, 1:300; C7, 1:100. Monoclonal antibody XA7, a hybridoma supernatant prepared against rabbit skeletal muscle triads, recognizes junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel/RYRs. The specificity of XA7 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of [ 3HI ryanodine-labeled receptors in the presence of ATP and loss of immunoprecipitable signal with addition of ruthenium red (Campbell et al., 1987). Affinity-purified polyclonal antibody aB5 was raised to an expressed recombinant portion of ßAPP 695 (amino acids 444-592) and recognizes both ßPP, and N'and N'plus O '-glycosylated full-length ßAPP (Oltersdorf et al., 1990). Anti-58K protein (Sigma) is a monoclonal antibody raised against a 58-kDa component of the outer Golgi membrane. 5a3! 1G7 is a mixture of two affinity-purified monoclonal antibodies raised against purified ‚8PP, and characterized by immunoblot and immunoprecipitation using aBS as standard (Koo and Squazzo, 1994). Anti-PDI is a monoclonal antibody raised against the KDEL bearing ER marker protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (Affinity Bioreagents). Dilutions used for immunocytochemistry were as follows: XA7, 1:20; aB5, 1:200 (except 1:20 as indicated for reinternalization of surface-labeled ßAPP); 58K, 1:20; 5a3 / 1G7, 1:200; PDI, 1:100. Conjugated secondary antibodies used for immunocytochemistry were 1:250 dilutions of goat anti-mouse CY3, biotinylated goat anti-rabbit, goat antirabbit CY3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and goat antimouse CY2, streptavidin CY2 (Biological Detection Systems).

Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation

Metabolic labeling of cells was carried out as described by Haass et al. (1991). After removal of culture medium and one wash with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 5.0 ml of methionine-free DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, 300 ~iCiof L-II 35S ] methionine, and agent or vehicle were added to cells for 12-14 h. Final DMSO concentration did not exceed 0.3%, and it was added to control dishes where indicated. Total cell extracts were prepared according to Weidemann et al. (1989). Conditioned medium (0.5 ml) was centrifuged at 10,000 g and transferred to a fresh tube. Immunoprecipitation by the method of Weidemann et al. (1989) was performed exactly as described by Haass et al. (1991). For pulse-chase experiments, [35S I methionine was added to cells in serum-and methionine-free medium for 1,5 h and, following one rapid wash, cells were chased in 5 ml offull medium for up to 8 h in the absence or presence of agent. R1280immunoprecipitated fractions were electrophoresed on 10-20% Tris-tricine gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels (Novex) at 80 V, 25°Cin 0.1 M Tris, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1 M tricine (pH 8.3) running buffer. Prestained protein standards (Bio-Rad) were loaded into one lane. Gels were dried and exposed on film at -70°C for 7 days.

Quantification and statistics

Quantification of Aß and p3 peptide band signals was performed by linear densitometric scanning (LKB) of auto-radiograms. Two-tailed, paired Student's t test was used to report significance. The Aß and intracellular calcium response curves to increasing concentrations of caffeine were fitted and the EC 50 calculated using the nonlinear regression program Prism (GraphPad Inc.).

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis

Changes in relative intracellular calcium levels in HEK293 cells transfected with ßAPP695 using various concentrations of brominated A23 187 and caffeine were evaluated by FACS. Suspended HEK293695 cells (1 X 106 cells! ml) were incubated with 1 11M indo-l in DMEM and 10% fetal calf serum and were excited at 355 nm; the increase from baseline in the absence of brominated A23 187 in the emission ratio 405/480 nm was used as a relative indicator of bound/free calcium. The mean peak response of all cells and the percentage of responding cells were obtained within 1 min following addition of agent. Resting levels of intracellular calcium were -30 nM using the formula [Ca 2~],= K~, X R -Rmin/Rmax -R, where ~= 44.5 in 15 j.eM brominated A23 187, Rmjn = 8.6 in calcium-deficient medium, and K 0 = 250 nM.

Immunocytochemistry

HEK293 cells stably transfected with either ßAPP695 or ßAPP751 cDNAs were grown to between 50 and 80% confluence on polylysine-coated 2 X 2 cm coverslips. After two rinses in PBS, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The cells were rinsed three times in PBS and blocked in 10% goat serum/PBS for 1 h. The coverslips were inverted onto 50 ~ilof primary antibody for 2-3 h. Following three 5-min washes, the secondary antibody was applied for 1 h. In the double-labeling procedure, the two primary and Iwo secondary antibodies were applied simultaneously. For the internalization experiments, cell surface ßAPP was labeled with anti-aB5 at 4°Cand the complex allowed to reinternalize at various times after warming to 25°Cbefore fixation, according to the method of Yamazaki et al. (1996). Coverslips were mounted onto standard microscope slides in 4% n -propyl gallate!66% glycerol/PBS and photographed through a Nikon Diaphot inverted fluorescence light microscope using excitation filters blue 450-490 and green 510-560 and barrier filters fluorescein (CY3) 520-560 and rhodamine (CY2) 590 nm.

RESULTS

To determine the effects of RYR stimulation on eellular Aß production, HEK293 cells stably transfected with ßAPP751 or ßAPP695 cDNA (Haass et al., 1992(Haass et al., , 1993) ) were exposed to the alkaloid caffeine. Caffeine is a potent and rapid stimulator of repetitive calcium release from most RYR isotypes by increasing both the sensitivity of the CICR process to calcium and the probability of the open channel state at saturating [Ca 2~] 1 (Endo, 1977;Fleischer and Inui, 1989). We used an assay for Aß that relies on the immunoprecipitation of both Aß and p3 (Haass et al., 1992) peptides from the medium of the transfected cells, using antibody R1280, after either a 14-h [ 35S]methionine labeling period in the absence or presence of caffeine (or other agents), or a 1.5-h pulse-label in the absence of agent followed by a chase in medium containing excess cold methionine with or without agent.

We observed a dose-dependent increase in Aß and p3 production by HEK 293ßApp 7SI cells in response to caffeine (Fig. lA). The Aß signals from two experiments were quantified and fitted in Fig. lB. The result indicates a saturable effect on Aß production at 5 mM caffeine. The calculated EC50 is 2.09 (1.45, 2.72; 95% confidence interval) mM caffeine. At 5 mM caffeine, the increase in release of Aß was 4.0 ±I .2-fold above control (n = 8, six experiments, p < 0.001). The production of p3 also increased in response to caffeine, but to a lesser degree than Aß (5 mM caffeine: 2.3 ±1.1-fold, p < 0.015). The p3 peptide derives from the l0-kDa COOH-terminal product of the a-secretase scission and not from Aß (Haass et al., 1993). The p3 signal was not further quantified in these experiments. There was also a small (1.4 ± 0.5-fold, p >0.10) increase in holo-ßAPP levels following caffeine exposure in the immunoprecipitations of cell lysates using antibody C7 (data not shown). The maximal degree to which Aß and ßAPP levels increased in cells exposed to caffeine was almost identical to the reported increases of 3.7-fold for Aß and 1.4-fold for ßAPP following application of the ionophore A23 187 (Querfurth and Selkoe, 1994). A23187 (1 tiM; Fig. 1D, lane S) and another calcium ionophore, ionomycin (2.5 1.tM; data not shown) also stimulated Aß release in the current experiments.

To determine the mechanism by which caffeine stimulates Aß production, we showed that wild-type HEK293 cells express RYR binding sites, and that caffeine and ryanodine both effect changes in [Ca 2~] 1 using ~3H]ryanodine-1abeled RYR binding, epifluorescence imaging of [Ca2~] 1, immunocytochemistry, and western blot techniques (Querfurth et al., unpublished observations). In Fig. 2A, we show that applications of caffeine (1-15 mM) to transfected HEK293ßAPP69S cells also stimulate a saturable rise in cytoplasmic free calcium. The calculated EC50 from the Boltzman sigmoidal curve is 2.29 mM caffeine, which is similar to the value of EC50 obtained for Aß release. The maximal rise in indo-1 fluorescence occurs at '-'-5 mM caffeine, which is almost equal to that produced by 1 1uM A23187 (Fig. 2B). At these concentrations of caffeine and ionophore, Aß is maximally released at similar quantities.

Metabolic labeling experiments in the presence and absense of ryanodine were performed. Ryanodine has a more complex concentration-and use-dependent modulating effect on CICR than does caffeine (Meissner, 1986;Fleischer and Inui, 1989;McPherson et al., 1991). At 50 ‚uM, ryanodine produced a modest increase in Aß (1.4 ±0.1-fold, n = 2; Fig. lA, lane 5). The combination of 50 1uM ryanodine plus a maximum caffeine concentration (10 mM) produced no further change in Aß release (Fig. lA, compare lanes 7 and 8). However, at a submaximal caffeine concentration (1.S mM), the addition of 3.3 ~M ryanodine, which alone had no effect on Aß levels, resulted in a further 2.3 ±0.4-fold increase (n = 2) of stimulated Aß release compared with 1.5 mMcaffeine alone (Fig. IC,. RYR blockers ruthenium red and procaine either significantly diminished or abolished caffeine's effect on Aß levels (Fig. 1C and D, lanes 6 and 3, respectively). The modulation of caffeine-stimulated Aß production by ryanodine and specific antagonists suggests that direct RYR stimulation is responsible for the caffeine effect on Aß secretion.

Thapsigargin (1.5 MM), an irreversible inhibitor of the SERCA-type ATPases that prevents calcium reuptake into ER stores (Thastrup et al., 1990), by itself produced a 1.9 ± 0.1-fold increase (n = 2) in Aß levels (Fig. lA, lane 6). However, when added together with 5 mM caffeine, an additional 2.5-fold increase (n = 2) in Aß production was obtained when compared with 5 mM caffeine alone (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Cyclopiazonic acid, another Ca 2-ATPase inhibitor, at I 1..tM had similar effects on Aß levels when used with caffeine (Fig. ID, lane 4), indicating that a sustained cytosolic calcium rise may further stimulate amyloidogenesis.

In the presence of caffeine and the absence of external calcium, Aß production was greatly attenuated. However, the cells quickly detach from their plates under these conditions, thereby precluding a conclusion on the role of added calcium influx in these measurements (data not shown). Preloading cells with 2.0-20 ‚uM BAPTA-AM, a rapid chelator used to buffer IICa 2~] 1transients, paradoxically resulted in a 2.5 ±1.2-fold increase in Aß levels (n = 5; data not shown). A similar increase was obtained in BAPTAloaded cells exposed to caffeine when compared with unloaded cells and caffeine alone. Although this result also indicates that [Ca 2~1] 1shifts are responsible, the interpretation is complex. Differential buffering of various cytoplasmic compartments following a transient release, leading to an actual increase in steady-state [Ca 2~I~from disinhibited influx, is one possibility (Louzao et al., 1996).

To determine further the extent to which changes in Aß levels were due to caffeine-induced changes in ßAPP processing, cells were pulse-labeled and chased with medium in either the absence or presence of caffeine. Under control conditions, Aß (and p3) secretion peaked 1.5 h after addition of chase medium containing an excess of cold methionine (Fig. 3, lane 1). In the presence of 10 mM caffeine, levels of released peptide were maximal at 3-5 h (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 7), and thereafter declined. The maximal increase was --2.4fold over control at 5 h (lane 7 versus lane 3). The magnitude of increase in Aß levels effected by caffeine under pulse-chase conditions was similar to the net increase in Aß levels obtained under 14-h caffeine metabolic labeling conditions (Fig. 1) after correcting for the small induction of precursor synthesis.

In a separate pulse-chase (5 h) experiment, total cellular ßAPP at the end of the chase did not differ significantly among control, caffeine, and ryanodine additions, as expected. Furthermore, the presence of thapsigargin (1.5 ~.tM)or ryanodine (100 ‚uM) alone or in combination with 10 mM caffeine reproduced the results from the aforementioned metabolic labeling paradigm (data not shown).

Caffeine-stimulated calcium mobilization could influence ßAPP processing and/or Aß production (a) within the ER, where RYRs are found in abundance (McPherson and Campbell, 1993), or (b) in the cytosolic microenvironment of the ER during the trafficking of ßAPP-bearing vesicles destined for secretion or the endosomal transport of reinternalized cell surface ßAPP destined for degradation. We performed immunocytochemistry on permeabilized HEK293 cells stably transfected with ßAPP 695 and ßAPP751 using double-labeling with antibodies XA7 against the type I RYR and aB5 to ßAPP.

The intensity of XA7 staining varied considerably from cell to cell, but generally was punctate and cytoplasmic (Fig. 4A). In many cells, a linear and occasionally radial pattern was discernible (Fig. 4C), seen more clearly in fibroblastic cells (data not shown). The specificity of RYR staining was demonstrated by (a) lack of signal after omission of primary antibody or using normal mouse ascites as control, and (b) staining of skeletal muscle triads (data not shown). Although these features are consistent with an ER location, they were not identical to the ER pattern obtained with antibody to the marker PDI. In Fig. 4H, the anti-PDI pattern in HEK293 cells is distributed in a nonpunctate, reticular manner consistent with its soluble nature and ER luminal location (Sitia and Meldolesi, 1992). In the same sections, ßAPP was punctate with most accumulation occurring over an eccentric perinuclear region, consistent with a localization to the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4B). Considerable overlap was seen between the RYR and ßAPP, particularly surrounding these eccentric accumulations (compare Fig. 4A and  B), but the patterns do not fully colocalize. The specificity of cellular ßAPP immunolocalization by anti-aBS was demonstrated by (a) colocalization of the eccentric ßAPP signal accumulation (Fig. 4D) with the Golgi marker-protein 58K (Fig. 4E), a result that confirms other reports (Caporaso et al., 1994;Haass et al., 1995b) 35S]methionine and exposed to drug for a 14h period, after which conditioned medium was collected and immunoprecipitated using antibody R1280 at a 1:300 dilution.

The following caffeine concentrations (in mM) were used: 0, n = 3; 1, n = 2; 1.5, n = 3; 2.5, n = 2; 5, n = 4; 10, n = 2; 15, n = 2.

Lanes 7-9: At submaximal caffeine (1.5 mM), the effect of low-dose ryanodine (3.3 ~M) is shown.

cells. The emission fluorescence of indo-1 at 405/480 nm (R) is indicated as a relative measure of ionized calcium. The following concentrations were used: for caffeine, 0, 1,3, 5, and 15 mM(n = 2 for each point) and 2 and 10 mM(n = 1); for A23187, 0, 1,2, and 5 ~M (n = 2) and 0.5 mM (n = 1). The mean R values from two experiments in A and two in B were fitted using Prism software and standard linear regression, respectively. All experiments were performed in DMEM (1.8 mM calcium). Error bars = 1 SD.

Golgi /vesicle pattern of ßAPP distribution with monoclonal antibodies 5a3/1G7 (Fig. 4F), and (e) no signal in the absence of primary antibody (data not shown). ßAPP staining in cells pretreated with brefeldin A, which is known to redistribute the Golgi compartment to the ER (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989), results in the loss of Golgi staining and the appearance of a signal more similar to the anti-PDI/ER pattern (Fig. 41; compare with 4H).

Another amyloidogenic ßAPP processing pathway involves the NPTY-dependent reinternalization of mature cell surface precursor (Koo and Squazzo, 1994). Figure 4J shows ßAPP within endosomes after 7.5 min. Figure 4K reveals the coalescence of signal into structures consistent with lysosomes after 20 min of warming. Although neither pattern shown resembles RYR or ER locations, a role for or against a calciumdependent proteolytic event along this pathway to Aß cannot be determined conclusively.

DISCUSSION

These experiments demonstrate that increases in intracellular free calcium, due to the mobilization of a caffeine-sensitive RYR-regulated poo1 of calcium, ac-FIG. 3. Pulse-label experiment. Aß and p3 releases increase during exposure to caffeine. Cultured HEK293ßApp 6gs cells were pulse-labeled with [ 35Slmethionine for 1.5 h. The medium was then replaced with normal DMEM (serum added) in the absence (lanes 1-4) and presence (lanes 5-8) of 10 mM caffeine. Caffeine was directly solubilized in DMEM (vehicle) before application. Medium was harvested for immunoprecipitation with Ri280 from control and caffeine-containing dishes at increasing chase times noted on top. The relative increase in Aß due to caffeine was 2.4-fold at 5 h (lane 7) compared with control (lane 3).

celerate both Aß and p3 peptide production by HEK293 cells stably expressing ßAPP. The caffeine effect on Aß release is caused most likely by the direct stimulation of endogenously expressed type 1 RYRs in these and other epithelioid cells (H. W. Querfurth et al., unpublished observations). The lowering of the threshold for CICR by caffeine and the ensuing calcium rise in localized cytosolic regions and/or in certain luminal compartments presumably affect either ysecretase or related Aß-generating proteases and/or the release of Aß from cells. This conclusion is supported mainly by the observation that caffeine increased the release of Aß and p3 and increased free calcium within the cytosol in a dose-dependent manner. Both processes saturate between 5 and 10 mM caffeine. Both the maximal levels of increase in Aß release and the degrees to which intracellular calcium responded at saturating doses were similar for caffeine and ionophores. The cumulative increase in peptides is observed with a 14-h exposure of cells to caffeine during metabolic labeling or as soon as 1.5 h into a cold chase in the presence of caffeine following pulselabeling. That the caffeine effect was receptor-mediated was supported by findings of saturability, modulation by ryanodine, and inhibition using the RYR antagonists procaine and ruthenium red. The effects of calcium reuptake inhibitors and chelation on the caffeine/Aß response also indicate that a change in [Ca2~j 1 is the responsible factor. Calcium release in some cells also can trigger calcium influx, either through L-channel activation (see below), a "capacitative entry" effect from store depletion, or a "feedforward" mechanism (Haverstick and Gray, 1993). We have not addressed the degree to which influx from any of these mechanisms contributes to caffeinestimulated Aß production.

The differential effect of raised [Ca 2~I, on the ysecretase (s) responsible for specific COOH-terminal Aß truncations at amino acids 40 (Aß 40) versus 42/43 (Aß42) was also not addressed in our study due to technical limitations. Both immunoprecipitations and ELISA using monoclonal antibodies that distinguish these species require higher levels of Aß expression than are afforded by the wild-type ßAPP-transfected HEK293 cells used here (Citron et al., 1996(Citron et al., , 1997)). We believe, ßAPP accumulations are similar, but not identical, to RYR localization (arrows).

however, that the amino acid 40 cutting y-secretase is the most likely calcium-sensitive event for the following reasons: (a) the calpain inhibitor MDL 28170 selectively inhibits formation of Aß,~, not Aß42 (Citron et al., 1996); and (b) Aß42 is produced extra-and intracellularly in small amounts (-10% of total Aß) relative to Aß40, even in the ßAPP717 and PS1 mutations where the position 42 cutting y-secretase is stimulated (Suzuki et al., 1994;Scheuner et al., 1996;Turner et al., 1996;Citron et al., 1997). Therefore, the longer Aß is an unlikely source for the fourfold increase in total Aß production due to caffeine.

The Aß42 peptide currently holds a preeminence in AD pathogenesis over the shorter, less fibrillogenic peptide (Jarrett et al., 1993;Iwatsubo et al., 1994). However, Aß40 contributes increasingly to neuritic and compacted plaque deposition as the disease progresses (Maggio et al., 1992), where total insoluble Aß becomes related to the content of Aß 40,not Aß42 (Tamaoka et al.,l994b). The equal contribution of Aß40 to AD pathology is also underscored by the facts that it is the principle component of vascular amyloid (Gravina et al., 1995;Yamaguchi et al., 1995) and that the APOE4 gene dosage correlates best with vascular amyloid and Aß40-positive plaque burden (Gearing et al., 1996). The possible relevance of an increase in Aß40 production, from stimulation of vessel wall (or neuronal) RYR to the AD process is discussed below.

The 1P3-sensitive pool of calcium is not responsible for the Aß/p3 generation, because muscarinic and metabotropic glutamate receptor-G protein-coupled stimulation of inositide hydrolysis, IP3 itself, and PKC activation all result in an augmentation of the nonamyloidogenic a-secretase pathway and a down-regulation of Aß production (Nitsch et al., 1992;Hung et al., 1993;Querfurth and Selkoe, 1994). Buxbaum et al. (1994) present evidence that phospholipase C activation may also decrease Aß production in a non-PKCdependent, but nonetheless calcium-dependent pathway. Their argument largely rests on the complicated action of thapsigargin, which was shown by them to decrease Aß by 36% at 20 nM, as well as increase Aß by 50% at 10 nM concentration. We show that thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid each augment the caffeine-stimulated release of Aß, presumably through the inhibition of the reuptake of released calcium. Caffeine can also act to antagonize muscarinic-induced 1P3 generation, action, and calcium mobilization (Zacchetti et al., 1991;Brown et al., 1992;Irving et al., 1992;Pozzan et al., 1994). There is also evidence that ryanodine/caffeine-and 1P3 /muscarinic-sensitive calcium release pools are spatially and functionally distinct in a number of secretory cell types and neurons (Walton et al., 1991;Feng et al., 1992;Sharp et al., 1993). Other caffeine actions, such as increases in cyclic AMP concentration and adenosine receptor antagonism (Nehlig et al., 1992), could also affect Aß production or calcium entry (Reddy et al., 1995). However, dibutyryl-cyclic AMP and forskolin additions had no effect on Aß release (Querfurth and Selkoe, 1994).

Type 1 RYR immunoreactivity in ßAPP-expressing and wild-type HEK293 cells (Querfurth et al., unpublished observations) is similar to the reported RYR staining pattern in cultured embryonic myotubes (Flucher, 1992). There is some correspondence between anti-RYR and anti-ßAPP decoration in the vicinity of the Golgi apparatus. In addition, RYR staining appears throughout the cytoplasm in a punctate, linear pattern. However, it does not colocalize precisely with the ER marker PDI or with ßAPP following brefeldin A treatment. Nonmuscle cells also possess RYR-contaming subspecialized smooth ER compartments and "calciosomes" (Volpe et al., 1991;Sitia and Meldolesi, 1992). The cellular compartment wherein Aß generation is accelerated by CICR has not been identified by our study. It is unlikely that the caffeine effect on amyloidogenic processing of ßAPP occurs within the RYR-containing ER, because brefeldin A abolishes amyloid peptide production (Haass et al., 1993). RYR activation could make a contribution to the post-TGN calcium milieu. Recent evidence, using a specific antibody against the ßPP~-Swedishvariant, favors a step following the trans-Golgi compartment en route to the cell surface as the site of accelerated Aß genesis for that mutant form of ßAPP (Haass et al., 1995b). The presenilins are also localized to the ER (Walter et al., 1996), but how they affect ßAPP processing is also unknown.

The increase in Aß production following RYR activation has implications for plaque and vascular Aß accumulation in AD. RYRs are abundantly expressed in normal brain (Sorrentino and Volpe, 1993) and are concentrated in regions prone to plaque accumulation in AD (hippocampal dentate gyrus, CA3/4 region, and neocortex), where they localize to ER-related structures contained within neuronal bodies, dendrites, and terminal synaptosomes (Villa et al., 1992;McPherson and Campbell, 1993;Sharp et al., 1993). Disordered neuronal calcium metabolism could account for the observation that Aß also accumulates in neurofibrillary tangles and plaque neuntes (Masters et al., 1985;Cras et al., 1991). Vascular smooth muscle cells also express the brain type 3 RYR isoform (Hakamata et al., 1992). Both caffeine and ryanodine cause calcium release within and contraction of vascular smooth muscle (Hisayama et al., 1990). Ultrastructural studies have shown that Aß is deposited within the outer basement membrane in the congophilic amyloid angiopathy of AD (Yamaguchi et al., 1992), and that it may be produced in the tunica media by proliferating or degenerating vascular smooth muscle cells (Kawai et al., 1993;Frackowiak et al., 1994).

Intracellular Aß deposits occur outside the CNS in the uniquely human muscle disease, inclusion body myositis (Mendell et al., 1991;Askanas et al., 1993). This raises the question whether a disorder of the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum RYR and disruption of calcium homeostasis could account for this observation. Aß accumulates in the chloroquine-treated denervated soleus vacuolar myopathy of rat (Tsuzuki et al., 1995); however, chloroquine decreases Aß production in cell culture systems (Shoji et al., 1992).

Aß release is also stimulated after bafilomycin exposure. To account for those changes, bafilomycin Al was hypothesized to (a) inhibit "classical" ß-secretase, resulting in the enhancement of non-Met-Asp 1 cleavages by alternative ß-secretases, and (b) inhibit endosomal/lysosomal degradation of ßAPP (Haass et al., 1995a). However, quite opposite effects on Aß and ßPP~production are observed using the alkalinizing agents monensin and NH 4C1 (Haass et al., 1993). The precise role of H + concentration on ßAPP processing, therefore, requires further clarification.

There is a strong interdependence between Ca 2~and H + within the acidic luminal environment of the secretory pathway. This is reflected in a gradient of Ca2ã nd H + content, which is maintained by a H + -ATPase, that increases from the RER to the TGN and secretory vesicles/granules. The latter proton pump provides the outward H + diffusion gradient that allows calcium to accumulate within the vesicle. This property has implications for the sorting of proteins destined for exocytosis (Chanat and Huttner, 1991). Dissolution of the TGN and/or secretory vesicle acidic luminal environment by NH 4C1, for instance, results in luminal calcium depletion (and mobilization of calcium into the cytosol) (Shorte et al., 1991). As already discussed, Aß production is usually reduced following such treatment. Thus, the increase in Aß production with calcium ionophores and caffeine in calcium-containing media could be a consequence of increased calcium sequestration within the acidic post-Golgi vesicles. This compartment is where the Met-Asp 1 Aß site and NH 2-terminal domain of ßAPP purportedly occur. We predicted that disruption of the acidic gradient would inhibit the calcium effect on Aß production. Indeed, both the acidotrope NH4C1 and the H+ ionophore monensin either attenuate or abolish the caffeine-or A23 187-induced stimulation of Aß production (Fig. 1C, lanes 2, 4, and 5, and Fig. 1D, lanes 5, 6, and 7). It is notable that the specific proteolytic cleavages of several plasma precursor proteins occur in the acidic trans-Golgi compartments through the action of an acid endoprotease with an absolute requirement for calcium in the millimolar range (Oda, 1992). We note the report that details the inhibition of total Aß release from cultured cells by a calpain inhibitor (Higaki et al., 1995), in support of our hypothesized role for calcium in amyloidogenesis.

The doses of caffeine used in these experiments are typical of those used in the study of CICR, but are supraphysiologic. Nonetheless, an endogenous and physiologically potent caffeine mimic has been identified recently as the messenger molecule cADP-ribose (Dargie et al., 1990;Curie et al., 1992). Physiologic RYR stimulation by calcium influx (CICR) may also follow neuronal depolarization (Friel and Tsien, 1992) or NMDA receptor activation (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993). Furthermore, familial AD mutations involving the ßAPP gene that increase ß-secretase activity at the expense of neuroprotectant ßPP~(sAPP a) production could lead to less effective suppression of calcium responses to glutamate stimulation (Furukawa et al., 1996) and aggravate amyloid formation. RYR activation may also stimulate additional calcium entry in neurons through L-type calcium channels via a novel functional coupling mechanism that is cyclic AMPindependent and also facilitated by metabotropic glutamate receptor activation (Chavis et al., 1996).

In conclusion, we propose that abnormal intracellular calcium mobilization may accelerate Aß formation.

Conversely, high Aß and low ßPP. (sAPP) a levels can promote excessive calcium influx in AD. Therapeutic interventions at either portion of the destructive cycle could abrogate Aß-mediated cellular toxicity.
