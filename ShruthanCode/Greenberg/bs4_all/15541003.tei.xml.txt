Tau aggregates are abnormally phosphorylated in inclusion body myositis and have an immunoelectrophoretic profile distinct from other tauopathies

Sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) is the most frequent progressive acquired inflammatory myopathy in people older than 50 years. Abnormal aggregates of ' Alzheimer's proteins', including tau proteins, have been previously demonstrated in s-IBM. In the present study, we have investigated by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting analysis the presence of tau proteins in muscle biopsy samples from patients with s-IBM and other myopathies with rimmed vacuoles, using newly developed antibodies raised against tau protein epitopes found in Alzheimer's disease brain. Tau immunoreactivity was shown in rimmed vacuoles or inclusions, preferentially with antibodies directed against phosphorylated carboxy-terminal epitopes of tau proteins. Cytoplasmic reactivity was also demonstrated in atrophic, nonvacuolated fibres, as well as in non-necrotic fibres invaded by inflammatory cells. Abnormally phosphorylated tau aggregates were also found in other compartments of the muscle fibre in s-IBM and other myopathies. Tau immunoblotting showed an electrophorectic profile of a doublet within the range of 60-62 kDa isovariants, which was different from tauopathies of the central nervous system. Finally, the unique pattern of immunoreactivity of s-IBM samples towards anti-tau antibodies is a new clue to a possible distinct subclass of peripheral tauopathy, different from the tauopathies of the central nervous system.

Introduction

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) was first described in 1967 and is now considered as the most frequent inflammatory muscle disease in people older than 50 years [1][2][3]. IBM is defined as a slowly progressive muscle weakness, predominantly affecting the distal muscles of the arm, in adults older than 30 [4]. The microscopic findings include lymphocyte infiltrates, atrophic fibres and rimmed vacuoles. Tubulofilamentous of 16-20 nm inclusions are found under electron microscopy [2,5]. Rimmed vacuoles are demonstrated in other muscular diseases (distal myopathies, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, X-linked vacuolar myopathy with excessive autophagy, desmin storage myopathy, acid maltase deficiency), in which tubulofilamentous inclusions are sometimes found [6]. The pathophysiology of IBM is still debated. In some patients, hereditary IBMs (h-IBMs) have been linked to several loci and mutations [7,8], and the more frequently affected gene would encode the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) [9]. Dominant h-IBMs have been reported to be associated with missense mutations in the myosin heavy chain IIa gene [10,11], or a locus on chromosome 14 [12]. However, most cases are sporadic and the origin of the disease is unknown. Because of the tubulofilamentous inclusions, possible viral infection has been proposed [1,13,14]. The immunophenotype of the inflammatory cells could be suggestive of autoimmunity [15] but autoantibodies are unusual in sporadic IBM (s-IBM) patients [16], and corticoids and immunosuppressive therapy poorly improve muscle function in s-IBM. Some authors have investigated mitochondrial genome and function in IBM, showing inconstant deletions in the mitochondrial DNA [17][18][19]. Another hypothesis is the presence of an abnormal single-stranded DNA binding protein [20].

Conclusive studies have focused on degenerative events in s-IBM leading to an emerging ' Alzheimer-characteristic proteins' hypothesis. The specific inclusions in s-IBM are revealed by the Congo red dye as amyloidogenic greenbirefringent deposits, demonstrating that these filaments share properties with amyloid proteins [21]. In s-IBM, the tubulofilaments exhibit a 15-21 nm external diameter, 3-6 nm internal diameter and are reminiscent of the socalled paired helical filaments (PHFs), the main components of which are the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) tau. Immunoreactivity for hyperphosphorylated tau proteins and PHF-like structures in inclusions of s-IBM have been described in 1993 [22,23].

Tau proteins belong to the family of MAPs [24]. Six different isoforms of tau are present in the adult human brain. They derive from a single gene located on chromosome 17, by an alternative splicing mechanism of exons 2, 3 and 10 [25]. The six adult isoforms exhibit an apparent molecular weight ranging from 45 to 62 kDa [26]. An additional 110 kDa isoform is found in the peripheral nervous system, where the exon 4A is also included [27]. Aggregated tau proteins are the main component of the neurofibrillary lesions found in numerous neurodegenerative disorders, so-called 'tauopathies'. A biochemical classification of these neurological disorders based on the electrophoretic profile of tau proteins distinguishes four subclasses. Class I mainly includes Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, postencephalitic parkinsonism and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism/dementia complex of Guam; class II includes progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and argyrophilic grain dementia; and Pick's disease and myotonic dystrophy are the typical profiles for classes III and IV subtypes, respectively [28].

Until now, s-IBM has not been definitely included within the spectrum of the tauopathies. So, to which subclass would it belong? It has been suggested that the electrophoretic profile of tau protein isoforms in s-IBM would be identical to tau in Alzheimer's disease because of the presence of a 68 kDa band, similar to one of the three bands that characterize tau proteins in Alzheimer's disease [29]. On the other hand, tau in s-IBM may belong to peripheral nerve included in the biopsy, and would therefore correspond to 'big tau' isoform [30].

Other similarities between s-IBM and Alzheimer's disease are also supported by demonstrating immunoreactivity for ubiquitin [31], amyloid b protein [32], b -amyloid precursor protein (APP) [33], apolipoprotein E [34], presenilin-1 [35], a -synuclein/nonamyloid component of plaques [36], and beta secretases BACE-1 and -2 [37]. In the sequence of lesions in s-IBM, APP deposits would appear first, before rimmed vacuoles and amyloid b , tau, and finally a -synuclein deposits [36,38]. Accumulations of prion protein and a 1-antichymotrypsin, survival motor neurone (SMN) and RNA have also been reported [33,39,40]. All of these proteins, except for tau, can be demonstrated in normal muscle fibres, mostly at the neuromuscular junction. Askanas et al . have therefore proposed a 'junctionalization of nonjunctional regions of muscle fibres' in s-IBM [41]. Nevertheless, tau proteins do not belong to the postsynaptic region of the neuromuscular junction, and their pathogenic role in s-IBM remains all the more to be clarified because of their relative abundance in s-IBM samples when compared to other Alzheimer-related proteins.

In order to clarify this latter point, we have further characterized the tau proteins and their phosphorylation status in muscle biopsies from patients with IBM, rimmed vacuole-bearing myopathies and controls with antibodies raised against Alzheimer pathological epitopes on tau proteins.

Our data demonstrate a peculiar phosphorylated status of tau in s-IBM and the unique electrophoretic pattern of a distinct class of peripheral tauopathy.

Patients and methods

Patients

Twenty-eight muscle biopsies were investigated, provided by the neuropathology departments of the University hospitals of Marseille and Lille. Diagnoses were s-IBM ( n = 9), h-IBM ( n = 1), oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD, n = 4), acid maltase deficiency (AMD, n = 1), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis-juvenile type (NCL, n = 1), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD, n = 3), congenital dystrophy without merosin deficiency (CMD, n = 1) and atrophy of type 2 muscle fibres (T2A, n = 3). Five control samples (20-53 years old) were obtained from patients who underwent muscle biopsy to exclude familial susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, and whose caffeine and halothan tests were negative. All cases of s-IBM, h-IBM, OPMD, DMD, CMD and NCL displayed vacuolated fibres on Gomori trichrome. Tubulofilaments were found under electron microscope examination in all cases of s-IBM and h-IBM, and specific inclusions were demonstrated in NCL and OPMD. The diagnosis was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and Western blot of dystrophin, sarcoglycans and merosin in DMD and CMD, and by biochemical analysis for AMD.

Antibodies (Table 1)

Four polyclonal anti-tau antibodies (PS422, TauCter, Tau-E2 and Tau-E3, raised in rabbit) and six mouse monoclonal antibodies were used (tau-1, AD 2, AD 92, AD 343, AD 385, AD 480). TauCter, Tau-E2, Tau-E3, AD 480 and PS422 were directed against synthetic peptides while the others were against a PHF-enriched preparation from an Alzheimer brain. TauCter is raised against a synthetic peptide encoding the last 15 amino acids of tau proteins [42]. The peptide sequences derived from exons 2 and 3 of the tau gene were labelled by the polyclonal Tau-E2 and Tau-E3 antibodies, respectively (antibodies previously described in reference [42]). AD 92, AD 343 and AD 480 are phospho-independent antibodies, directed against the amino-terminal part (AD 92 and AD 343) or the carboxyterminal part of tau (AD 480) [43]. Tau-1 (Boehringer Manheim, Germany) is an antibody that only labels tau proteins among unphosphorylated serine residues 195, 198, 199 and 202. All other antibodies are phosphodependent antibodies. AD 2 is specific of the phosphorylated serine 396-serine 404 epitope of tau located on native tau proteins and tau inclusions [44]. PS422 is directed against the phosphorylated serine 422 epitope of tau protein; expression is found in several neurodegenerative diseases, but not in normal brain [45]. AD 385 reactivity is shown on Alzheimer brain, giving rise to a tau triplet pattern, but not on normal brain tau; its precise epitope remains unknown.

Immunohistochemistry

Deltoid or quadriceps muscle tissue samples were frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane and kept at -80 ∞ C until use. Serial 10-m m-thick transverse sections of muscle biopsies were preincubated in buffer with nonimmune goat serum for 30 min at room temperature, and then rinsed and incubated with the tau antibodies mentioned above for 2 h at room temperature. They were rinsed and then incubated in a biotinylated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody solution (Vectastain, Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 1 h at room 

Immunoblotting

The muscle samples were from six s-IBM patients, agematched controls, AMD and T2A patients. The muscle samples were pulverized under liquid nitrogen in a small steel mortar and weighted [46]. Brain tissue homogenates from a surgical biopsy control and an autopsy-derived Alzheimer cortex served as controls of tau isoforms. Mus-cle and brain tissue sample homogenization in SDS buffer, protein resolution by SDS-PAGE and Western blots were performed as previously described [47]. Antibodies used for biochemical analysis were PS422, AD 92, AD 385, tau-1 and TauCter.

Results

Immunohistochemistry

Results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.

In IBM, rimmed vacuoles and/or inclusions were immunoreactive for anti-carboxy-terminal epitopes of tau (TauCter/AD 2/AD 480/PS422/AD 385; Figures 1 and  2).

In all IBM cases, AD 2, PS422, AD 385 and AD 480 labelled cytoplasmic inclusions (Figure 1). The lining of the rimmed vacuoles and the material present inside of the rimmed vacuoles were strongly labelled with PS422. The cytoplasm beneath the sarcolemma was reactive in vacuolated fibres as well. PS422 stained all the nuclei of the muscle fibres, and mildly the cytoplasm. AD 2 immunoreactivity was strong in the inclusions and absent in the rimmed vacuoles, and was also enhanced under the cytoplasmic membrane of vacuolated fibres. The anti-amino-terminal tau AD 343 (raised against the 20/44 sequence) showed rare inclusion immunoreactivity and a faint signal on the cytoplasmic membrane, and AD 92 immunoreactivity (1/19 sequence) was present in all patients and controls, displaying a similar diffuse, cytoplasmic, mild staining (not shown).

In s-IBM and in progressive muscular dystrophies, the cytoplasm of atrophic fibres, non-necrotic fibres partially invaded by inflammatory cells and foci of necrotic/regenerating cells were also reactive with antibodies raised against the anti-carboxy-terminal tau epitopes (Figure 3). The nuclei in DMD fibres were not immunoreactive. AD 2, AD 480 and PS422 antibodies stained the intermyofibrillar network in atrophic muscle fibres, OPMD, DMD and CMD as well. No inclusion was seen but the subsarcolemmal cytoplasm of vacuolated fibres was labelled by AD 2, but not by AD 480.

Immunoblotting

In s-IBM muscle samples, two tau isovariants were detected, within the range of the so-called 0 N3R species. Anti-tau antibodies mainly detected protein isovariants of approximately 60 kDa more abundant than in non-IBM muscle samples, and no band of 55, 64, 69 and 74 kDa. There was an additional band only in s-IBM samples, corresponding to tau isovariants of slightly higher molecular weight, absent in the control muscles. All five antibodies labelled a 110 kDa tau variant in all muscle samples, which may correspond to the peripheral nerve tau variant ('big tau') (Figures 4 and 5).

In an attempt to specify the solubility of tau protein isovariants within the IBM muscle samples, we tried to extract insoluble tau. Unfortunately, because of the low amount of available tissue specimen, the extraction failed; immunoprecipitation of the tau species could not be performed.   were loaded onto 8-16% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with an antibody directed against the carboxy terminus of tau (TauCter). Two additional brain tissue homogenates (prefrontal cortex) were loaded, obtained at autopsy from a control and an Alzheimer patient. TauCter labels all tau isoforms (normal and pathological) in normal brain tissue, Alzheimer brain (giving rise to a tau triplet of 60/64/69 kDa, indicated on the right part of the panel) and muscle samples. In s-IBM, the 60 kDa isovariants are more abundant than in non-s-IBM samples and the band is duplicated, giving rise to a minor band, absent in the other muscle samples (the additional band is pointed by black arrows). Molecular weight markers correspond to ovalbumin (45 kDa) and serum albumin (66 kDa).

normal brain obtained at biopsy or autopsy. The phosphorylated Ser422 has been demonstrated in diseases spanning the four subclasses of tauopathies, including Down syndrome, Guamanian complex, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, post encephalitic Parkinsonism and Pick's disease [45]. Because: (1) normal tau proteins are quickly dephosphorylated by phosphatases after death; (2) hyperphosphorylated tau isoforms remain PS422-immunoreactive in Alzheimer brain tissue in spite of long post-mortem delays before autopsy; and (3) biopsy-derived brain protected against dephosphorylation is poorly immunoreactive, PS422 is likely to label a pathologically phosphorylated tau epitope and permits the distinction between normal and pathological tau proteins. Therefore PS422 reactivity in s-IBM is a strong indication to consider s-IBM as a tauopathy. In most tau pathologies, tau variants are aggregated and partly insoluble. We failed to purify the insoluble tau in IBM muscle samples because of the paucity of available muscle tissue. Previous studies have already reported Alzheimer-like tau epitopes in IBMs (Table 4). Tau aggregates would correspond to the 66-68 kDa brain isoforms of tau, using SMI31 and AT8 [29]. By other authors, only the 100-110 kDa isoform of tau, which belongs to normal peripheral nerve, is found by Western blot in IBM, as well as in other muscular disorders with rimmed vacuoles, including OPMD and muscular dystrophies [30].

Discussion

Inclusions and rimmed vacuoles in IBM were immunoreactive with three antibodies directed against abnormally phosphorylated sites located in the carboxy-terminal part of tau AD 2, PS422 and AD 385 are phospho-dependent antibodies. The epitopes of AD 2 and AD 385 are phosphorylated in normal biopsy-derived brain tissue samples, but hyperphosphorylated in several tauopathies, as well as the PS422 epitope [44,45].

The AD 2 includes the double phosphorylated serine 396/404 and is similar to the PHF-1 epitope, in which immunoreactivity has been reported in IBM inclusions [29]. The hyperphosphorylated Ser396/Ser404, also detected by the C5 antibody, could be induced in the experimental model of chloroquine myopathy in rat, where rimmed vacuoles are immunoreactive for this epitope, but are negative for AT8, another phosphodependent anti-tau antibody directed against a noncarboxy-terminal tau epitope [48].

The Ser422 residue of tau had never been studied in IBM and our data demonstrate the existence of this phosphorylated epitope in IBM, as shown by PS422. The disease-specific phosphorylation of the Ser422 epitope has been shown on Alzheimer patient's brain tissue but not in  

Anti-tau antibodies also label atrophic muscle fibres, vacuoles and muscle fibres invaded by inflammatory cells in myopathies other than IBM

In our series, we found by immunohistochemistry abnormally phosphorylated tau in atrophic fibres in OPMD, DMD, patients with type 2 fibre atrophy, NCL and acid maltase deficiency, as shown by AD 2, AD 343, AD 385, AD 480 and PS422. Other tau epitopes have been described by others in OPMD, Becker muscular dystrophy, dermatomyositis, central core disease, neurogenic atrophy and in the recovery phase of an attack of malignant hyperthermia [30,36,48]. In these diseases, tau immunoreactivity colocalizes with tubulin, desmin and vimentin, which are shown in atrophic, necrotic, and regenerating fibres.

Immunoreactivity for the nonphosphorylated amino terminus in normal and pathological muscle samples

We have observed immunoreactivity in all cases for the 1-19 residues (AD 92) and 20-44 residues (AD 343) of tau. The amino-terminal part of tau is present in normal tau proteins, and the phospho-independent AD 343 and AD 92 are not directed against abnormally phosphorylated tau epitopes. Therefore, the labelling of all muscle samples is in accordance with previous works, demonstrating the coding mRNA of tau in rat skeletal muscle, up to 15% of brain levels [49]. The functions of tau proteins in normal muscle fibres are not well understood, but they could modulate the microtubule network, important for the organization of sarcomeres during myogenesis [50] and for endocytosis mechanisms [51]. The so-called ' Alzheimer-characteristic proteins' are present in normal muscle, mostly restricted to the neuromuscular junction, except for tau [41]. In our series, the cytoplasmic membrane or the cytoplasm were diffusely immunoreactive, without any reinforcement. Further investigation may include the labelling of tau combined to the detection of neuromuscular junctions, by means of labelled bungarotoxin, for instance.

Is there a specific tau signature in IBM, on Western blot analysis, supporting a distinct subclass of tauopathy?

As a matter of fact, the presence of tau in muscle fibres is not abnormal by itself, but the abnormal phosphorylation of carboxy-terminal epitopes that are found in tauopathies of the central nervous system may be relevant to a specific implication of tau proteins in s-IBM. Moreover, we suggest that s-IBM muscle samples display a specific pattern of distribution of tau variants, different from Alzheimer's disease and other brain tauopathies. In our cases, five antibodies, including PS422 which recognizes a pathologically phosphorylated serine residue on tau, labelled a tau doublet in the same range of 60-62 kDa. An aberrant splicing of the tau pre-mRNAs occurs in the brain tissue from myotonic dystrophy patients: it leads to a profound decrease in the amounts of tau protein variants devoid of sequences derived from exons 2 and 3 [42]. Here signals corresponding to the tau exons 2 and 3-derived sequences were detected in tau-positive inclusions.

A tau doublet has already been described by Mirabella et al . [29], with AT8 antibody, at 66-68 kDa. These authors suggested that tau variants in s-IBM and Alzheimer would share phenotypic similarities. We speculate that the biochemical profile of tau variants in s-IBM is original and different from tau isoforms demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease (tau triplet of 60-64-69 and a minor component of 74 kDa), PSP/CBD/AGD (64-69 kDa doublet), Pick disease (60-64 kDa), or DM1 (major 60 kDa, minor 64 and almost absent 69 kDa components) [28]. The duplication of the tau variants of 60-62 kDa may represent a different phosphorylation status of a same tau isoform. In order to perform an immunoprecipitation of tau species, a total muscle sample homogenate of larger amounts of s-IBM muscle tissue should be used, which would exceed the mass of usually available specimens [52].

In conclusion, we suggest that: (1) s-IBM is a true, peripheral tauopathy; (2) like in brain tauopathies, serine residues that are not phosphorylated in control samples are abnormally phosphorylated in muscle from s-IBM patients; and (3) the duplication of tau variants of 60-62 kDa may be a biochemical 'signature' of s-IBM.

Figure 3 .3Figure 3. Tau-1 and TauCter immunolabelling of sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) and control. The labelling of inclusions by tau-1 without prior alkaline phosphatase demonstrates immunoreactivity for nonphosphorylated serine 195/198/199/202 residues of tau, which are not demonstrated in controls. Immunostaining for the 15 carboxyterminal residues of tau is similar to tau-1.

Muscle samples from sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) patients (lanes 1-6), three controls (lanes 7-9), one acid maltase deficiency case (lane 10) and one selective atrophy of type 2 fibres (lane 11) were loaded onto 8-16% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with an antibody directed against the carboxy terminus of tau (TauCter). Two additional brain tissue homogenates (prefrontal cortex) were loaded, obtained at autopsy from a control and an Alzheimer patient. TauCter labels all tau isoforms (normal and pathological) in normal brain tissue, Alzheimer brain (giving rise to a tau triplet of 60/64/69 kDa, indicated on the right part of the panel) and muscle samples. In s-IBM, the 60 kDa isovariants are more abundant than in non-s-IBM samples and the band is duplicated, giving rise to a minor band, absent in the other muscle samples (the additional band is pointed by black arrows). Molecular weight markers correspond to ovalbumin (45 kDa) and serum albumin (66 kDa).

PS422 labels all tau isoforms in a brain tissue homogenates from an Alzheimer patient (60/64/69 kDa), but not in the control. Arrows indicate the additional 62 kDa band.
