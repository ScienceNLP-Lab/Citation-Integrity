Controlling autoimmunity in sporadic inclusion-body myositis

Sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) spans two areas of interest in my research lab, the role of protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disease [1][2][3][4] and the role of secondary autoimmunity in degenerative conditions in the nervous system 5-10 and in muscle. 11,12 After some comments on the potential pathologic role of inclusion bodies themselves, I shall focus attention on two approaches to controlling the autoimmune response in muscle tissue: inhibition of lymphocyte homing with antibodies to alpha 4 beta 1 integrin, [13][14][15] and nonspecific downregulation of autoimmunity with statins. [14][15][16] Aggregations in neurodegenerative disease. We have studied the role of transglutaminase in the crosslinking of huntingtin aggregates in Huntington disease (HD). [1][2][3][4] The aggregates in HD have characteristics of covalently linked protein multimers, with occasional ordered areas of amyloid with its accompanying birefrigent optical properties when stained with Congo red. In HD we can ameliorate the disease modestly by inhibiting the enzyme transglutaminase, TGase. TGase catalyzes the formation of glutaminyl-lysyl linkages. Inhibtion of TGase in vivo prolonged lifespan, and diminished tremor and weight loss in a transgenic animal model of HD. Despite the fact that TGase is part of the aggregate in HD, and that TGase inhibition ameliorates disease in the transgenic animal model of HD, treatment with cystamine does not appreciably reverse gross aggregates, unless instituted at a very early stage of disease. Increasing evidence suggests that whereas early microaggregates may have pathologic properties, gross aggregates may not be pathogenic per se, and might even have protective characteristics. [1][2][3][4] Strategies aimed at blocking aggregates could certainly be given together with treatments that block the accumulation of inflammatory cells in muscle.

Treating the inflammatory/autoimmune features of s-IBM. The inflammatory response in muscle in s-IBM has many features of an autoim-

mune infiltrate, replete with CD4 and CD8 T cells and macrophages. [17][18][19] The milieu in muscle provides all the necessary features for involvement of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response. It is interesting to note that even degenerative diseases of muscle, like Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, have aspects of the adaptive immune response with T cell infiltration and macrophages. Using PCR to monitor T-cell receptor rearrangements in pathologic tissue specimens, we have been able to see clonal rearrangments of T-cell receptor V-D-J segments in polymyositis and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. The nature of the T-cell receptor rearrangments in Duchenne muscle has aspects of an antigen specific immune response, reminiscent of what is observed in polymyositis. 11,12 At this time, however, we do not know the targets of the adaptive immune response in s-IBM, so antigen specific approaches to tolerizing these aberrant responses is not possible. [5][6][7][8] Even when we do know the targets of the adaptive immune response, including the detailed specificity of T cells and antibodies in autoimmune diseases, ranging from myasthenia gravis to MS, we are woefully inept at shutting down adaptive immunity in an antigen-specific manner, and inducing specific tolerance. 14,15 Instead most of our success in immune therapy to date has come from intervention in innate immune pathways. 14,15 Among the relevant pathways worthy for clinical trials in s-IBM would be the use of blockade of lymphocyte homing, and the application of statins to block a spectrum of pathogenic innate immune responses.

Blockade of lymphocyte homing with antibodies to alpha-4 beta-1 integrin was approved for reduction of relapses in relapsing remitting MS in November 2004. [13][14][15] However, the drug Tysabri, a humanized monoclonal antibody, was withdrawn in February 2005 due to three cases (as of this writing) of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients who have received the newly approved drug. Statins are therefore much more attractive in s-IBM because of their dual virtues as cholesterol lowering drugs and because of their potent anti-inflammatory properties. [14][15][16][17][18][19][20] Blockade of lymphocyte homing for treatment of s-IBM. In the past 15 years, the steps involved in the homing of lymphocytes to inflamed tissue have been elucidated. Lymphocytes, flowing in the venules of the vasculature, are slowed in the vicinity of inflammation by two signals, one coming from chemokines, and the second from a variety of adhesion molecules including selectins and integrins. In 1992 we showed that alpha-4 beta-1 integrin was critical for the entry of lymphocytes into inflamed brain. 13,15 Alpha-4 beta-1 integrin 13,15 was subsequently shown to be the key molecule in homing to a number of sites including the intestines in inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, the brain in MS, and the joints in rheumatoid arthritis. Blockade of lymphocyte homing was accompanied by spectacular success in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and MS. In a 2-year, phase III trial of a humanized antibody named Tysabri to alpha-4 beta-1 integrin for treatment of MS, the relapse rate was lowered by 66% compared to placebo, with monthly treatment at doses of 3 to 6 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the humanized monoclonal. This lead to the approval of Tysabri at the end of 2004. However, within 3 months the drug was withdrawn because of three cases (at the time of this writing) of PML, a rare infection with a polyoma virus, JC virus, typically seen in immunosuppressed patients taking medicines to suppress transplant rejection or in patients with HIV. Apparently the success in blocking lymphocyte entry into the CNS allowed the JC virus to replicate unchecked and cause this fatal infection. The notion that blockade of lymphocyte homing as a safe and effective strategy to treat inflammatory disease was proven wrong. Blockade of lymphoctye adhesion was efficacious, but the risk of a fatal infection, with three known in the first few thousand treated patients, is unacceptable. This therapeutic approach is therefore misguided: without immune surveillance the risk of opportunistic infection is simply too high.

As the tragic story of lymphocyte blockade emerges, it appears that there may be a very interesting reason why progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is seen, and not other typical opportunistic infections like tuberculosis or fungal infections. The polyoma viruses, including JC virus (Ousman and Steinman, unpublished observations) have receptors for integrins, 21 and blockade of integrins, may somehow modulate the dormancy and spread of these viruses in brain. Blockade of lymphocyte homing, once considered a highly attractive therapy for treatment of S-IBM, can no longer be considered as worth the risk of a potentially life threatening opportunistic infection with JC virus, causing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

Use of statins as cholesterol lowering and antiinflammatory drugs in s-IBM.

Statins, devised as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to lower cholesterol, have remarkable anti-inflammatory properties. 8,[14][15][16] Oral administration of 80 mg/kg simvastatin (Zocor) reduced the expected number of new gadoliniumenhancing lesions in relapsing-remitting MS patients by 44% in a small 6-month open-label trial. 22 Atorvastatin (Lipitor) has also shown promising results in lowering disease scores and vascular risk factors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and is currently being tested in MS in a multicenter, placebo-controlled trial. 23 Studies in EAE and other models of autoimmune disease have revealed that statin drugs interfere with the autoimmune destruction of target tissues by inhibiting multiple arms of the immune response. 8,[14][15][16][24][25][26] For instance, in EAE, lovastatin prevents the production of the inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor, gamma interferon and inducible nitric oxide synthase by astrocytes, microglia, and infiltrating macrophages in the CNS. 24 Atorvastatin inhibits inducible expression of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules on CNS-resident antigen presenting cells. [14][15][16] Moreover, statin drugs prevent expansion and differentiation of Th1 autoreactive T cells [14][15][16] and the migration of these autoreactive T cells across the blood-brain barrier. 26 All of these anti-inflammatory effects would be virtues for treatment of S-IBM.

In addition, Askanas and Engel have proposed "that within s-IBM muscle fibers, cholesterol, instead of being properly metabolized or cleared, is deposited, with caveolin-1, at sites of Abeta accumulation and possibly at sites of Abeta precursor protein processing, where it may adversely increase A beta production and induce Abeta misfolding and aggregation." 17 Therefore, a treatment that not only has multiple virtues as an anti-inflammatory, but also lowers cholesterol would seem to have optimal specifications for use in S-IBM. The benefits and risks of statins for treatment of s-IBM are outlined in the table.
