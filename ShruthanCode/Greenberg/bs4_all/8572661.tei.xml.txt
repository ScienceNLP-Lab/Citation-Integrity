The characrerictic features of pepsin cleavage  The relative frequencies and significance of these features in the pathogenesis of sporadic IBM is still uncertain. The disease could be initiated or perpetuated by focal cytoplasmic or nuclear degradation, accumulation of amyloid related proteins, an autoimmune attack on the muscle fibers by T cells, by a combination of any of these factors, or by a yet unidentified mechanism. One may speculate that muscle fiber destruction may result from nuclear damage, the accumulation of amyloid-related proteins, invasion of fibers by autoaggressive inflammatory cells, or necrosis. In this study, we assess the relative frequencies of congophilic amyloid deposits, invasion of nonnecrotic fibers by T cells, and fiber necrosis.

Subjects and Methods

Thirty-one consecutive and electron microscopy proven cases of sporadic IBM were studied. Twenty-eight patients were male and 3 were female. Twenty were untreated or had received no treatment for at least 3 months prior to biopsy (Table 1). Eleven had received prednisone, sometimes in combination with azathioprine, methotrexate, or cyclosporin A (Table 2). All 11 showed progression of weakness despite therapy, consistent with the notable refractoriness of IBM to therapy [2, 31. The mean ages at biopsy and duration of symptoms before biopsy were not significantly different. The mean duration of prednisone treatment was 68.4 months. The mean dose of prednisone was 247 mglweek.

Two consecutive 1 0-pm cryostat sections were analyzed in each case. One section was stained with Congo red [6] Table I    and examined under rhodamine fluorescence optics [9] to detect the congophilic deposits in rhe fibers (Fig 1E 

Results and Discussion

There was a wide dispersion in the frequency of the different species of abnormal fibers in the sampled population. For all 31 patients, however, the frequency of invaded fibers (mean, 24.31 1,000; median, 19.7/ 1.000) was severalfold higher than that of the CR+ fibers (mean, 3.1 / 1,000; median, 3.1 / 1,000) or that of the necrotic fibers ( ~~i ~i i i , 3.1 / 1,000; median, 2.1 / 1,000).

The results for the 20 untreated and 11 treated patients are shown separately in Tables 1 and 2 and in Figure 2. The following can be nored: (1) In all patients except Patient 21, the invaded fibers were more frequent than the CR+ fibers. T h e mean and median frequencies of the invaded fibers were severalfold higher than the corresponding frequencies of the C R + fibers in either the untreated or treated group ( p < 0.001 for the untreated and p < 0.05 for the treated group).

(2) The frequencies of invaded fibers in the treated and untreated groups were not significantly different. (3) In a similar manner, the frequencies of the CR+ fibers in the treated and untreated groups were not significantly different. (4) The frequencies of necrotic fibers i n the treated and untreated groups were not significantly different. ( 5 ) There was no significant correlation between the frequency of invaded fibers and syniptom duration in either group. (6) There was no significant correlation between the frequency of C R + fibers and symptom duration in either group. (7) There was no significant correlacion between the frequency of invaded fibers and length of treatment in the treated group. (8) There was no significant correlation benveen the frequency of CR+ fibers and length of treatment in the treated group. (9) There was no significant correlation between Congo red positivity and muscle fiber invasion or necrosis.

We also determined the frequencies of fibers that were both necrotic and C R + , or both invaded and CR+. These frequencies were generally less than 0.5/ 1,000 and the corresponding values for the treated and untreated parients were not significantly different. This indicates that the CR+ fibers are neither exempt from nor selectively vulnerable to necrosis or cell-mediated cytotoxicity .

The much higher frequency of invaded fibers than of CR+ fibers suggests that in sporadic IBM, T cell-mediated niyocytotoxicity has greater pathologic significance than the accumulation of congophilic deposits and points to the importance of an immunemediated mechanism in the disease. O n the other hand, the congophilic deposits may only be the end result of focal cytoplasmic or nuclear degeneration that were not assessed in the present study.

The frequencies of the observed abnormalities were not significantly different in treated and untreated patients. This comparison might have been more precise if the same patients had been biopsied before and after treatment; but even then a sampling error t~iay arise due to the focality of the pathologic process. In this connection, two recent studies of patients biopsied before and after prednisone therapy are of interest. O n e study of 8 patients found a decreased number of T cell-invaded fibers after treatment for a mean period of 13.6 months [ 131. The other study found no change in the number of inflammatoiy infiltrates after 3 months of therapy [14]. Neither study states the frequency of invaded fibers before or after therapy. Our findings indicate that (1) after long-term (mean: 68.4 months) prednisone treatment T cell-mediated myocytotoxicity remained the most frequrnt pathologic alteration in 10 of 1 1 patients, and (2) neither longterm treatment nor prolonged disease duration were associated with a significant change in the median frequency of any species of abnormal fibers. These findings point away from the notion that sporadic IBM is a degenerative disease conditioned by progressive accumulation of arnyloid deposits in the muscle fibers. O n the other hand, the results do not establish T cell-mediated myocytoxicity as the main pathogenic event in sporadic IBM. Finally, our observations shed no light on the factors that initiate the various pathologic reactions or how the various reactions are interrelated or perpetuated in the course of the disease.

Invasion of nonnecrotic muscle fibers by cytotoxic T cells, accumulation of congophilic amyloid inclusions in mus- cle fibers, and fiber necrosis are consistent histologic findings in sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM). To evaluate the relative significance of these alterations, we quantitatively analyzed the frequency of these abnormali- ties in 31 electron microscopy proven cases of IBM (20 untreated and 11 immunosuppressed). Nonnecrotic mus- cle fibers invaded by T cells were severalfold more fre- quent than fibers displaying the other pathologic alter- ations. Comparison of muscle samples from treated and untreated patients revealed no significant differences in the respective frequencies of the three species of abnormal fibers. Moreover, there was no correlation of the fre- quency of any abnormality either with disease duration or length of treatment. The much higher Frequency of the invaded than Congo red-positive fibers points to the importance of an immune-mediated mechanism in the disease; but the basic cause of the disease remains unde- fined.as ; 1 function of time.

). 7'he section was then stained with trichrorne and the invaded fibers (Fig 1A-D) and necrotic fihers were identified by conventional criteria[lo]. In the second section, the CD3 Tcell marker was irnmunolocalized to visualize muscle fibers invaded by T cells [ 111. The frequencies of invaded fibers detected by the two methods were nor significantly different by the paired t-test. To avoid any selection bias, all muscle fibers in all sections were photographed and counted [ 121. A total of 114,797 muscle fibers, or 311 average of 3,700 fibers per biopsy, were surveyed. All Congo red-positive (CRt), all necrotic, and all invaded fibers were counted in each section. The results were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney rank sum rest a n d the Spearman rank corre-lation test.
