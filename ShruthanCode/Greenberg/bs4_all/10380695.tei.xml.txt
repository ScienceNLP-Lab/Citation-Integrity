Mapping of a candidate region for susceptibility to inclusion body myositis in the human major histocompatibility complex

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a form of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy of unknown aetiology. A strong association with HLA class II (HLA-DR3) suggested a role for genes in the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the predisposition to this disease. In this study, we have taken advantage of the ancestral haplotype (AH) concept and historical recombinations to map for a possible susceptibility gene(s) in the MHC. We performed detailed typing of three MHC-related HSP70 genes and defined allelic combinations in the context of MHC AH. We also modified existing methods to give a simple and accurate method for typing two TNF microsatellites. Using the HSP70 and TNF markers and HLA-DR, -B, and C4 typing of our patients with IBM, we defined a po-tential site for the MHC-associated susceptibility gene(s) in the region between HLA-DR and C4.

Introduction

A feature of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is the strong linkage disequilibrium between alleles at a number of loci. The co-occurrence of certain combinations of alleles on specific haplotypes has led to the definition of a series of ancestral haplotypes (AH) which have been held together during human evolution and occur commonly in the general population (Degli-Esposti et al. 1992a,b,d;Zhang et al. 1990). The AH concept predicts that haplotypes from unrelated individuals which share certain marker alleles at loci such as HLA-B and -DR will be identical for the alleles at loci between B and DR.

MHC associations with several diseases have been described. In some diseases the MHC association is strongest with an individual allele at a single locus (e.g., HLA-B27 and ankylosing spondylitis). In other diseases the associations are with alleles, or combinations of alleles, which form part of conserved AH. Thus assignment of the primary association, and ultimately the predisposing gene, is somewhat difficult. Furthermore, in these cases the investigation of MHC associations by analysis of single loci is relatively uninformative. One approach to the analysis of such disease associations is to map the predisposing gene within the MHC by taking advantage of patients who possess only portions of the AH due to historical, rather than recent, recombinations (Degli-Esposti et al. 1992a,c). In order to do this it is necessary to have knowledge of the polymorphic variation and the combination of alleles of the genes within each AH.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a form of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy that predominates in males over 50 years of age (Chou 1993;Dalakas 1991). It is characterized clinically by the insidious development of muscle weakness and atrophy in the distal and proximal muscles of the arms and legs (Griggs et al. 1995) and poor response to corticosteroid or immunosuppresive therapy (Mastaglia et al. 1993). Histopathological features include mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates primarily consisting of CD8 c T cells and macrophages (Engel and Arahata 1984), rimmed vacuoles, hyaline eosinophilic inclusions, and atrophic angular muscle fibres. Clusters of 15-21 nm tubulofilamentous structures in the muscle fibres are demonstrable by electron microscopy (Askanas and Engel 1995). The abnormal accumulation of proteins such as b-amyloid, hyperphosphorylated tau, apolipoprotein E, a1-antichymotrypsin, ubiquitin, prion protein, fibroblast growth factor, and transforming growth factor-b in affected muscle is characteristic of IBM (Askanas and Engel 1995).

The very strong association of HLA-DR3 with IBM which we reported previously can be primarily attributed to the increased prevalence of AH marked by HLA-DR3/B8 (Garlepp et al. 1994). Our preliminary studies suggested that a region of interest was be-tweenHLA-DR and -B, since this region of the AH is shared by our patients with IBM (unpublished data). A number of genes have been identified in this central region of the MHC (Campbell and Trowsdale 1997;Sargent et al. 1989a,b;Spies et al. 1989a,b). Included among these are three heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) genes (Milner and Campbell 1990) and two tumor necrosis factor (TNF) genes (Carroll et al. 1987;Dunham et al. 1987;Spies et al. 1986). Each of these genes has been shown to be polymorphic at the DNA level (Milner and Campbell 1992;Udalova et al. 1993) and could be used as markers for mapping of the MHC. Three common alleles have been defined forHSP70-1 (Cascino et al. 1993a;Milner and Campbell 1992) and two for each of HSP70-2 and HSP70-Hom (Milner and Campbell 1992). The polymorphic variants of HSP70-2 have been shown to be in linkage disequilibrium with certain DR alleles or to be present on certain AH but there is only minimal information available regarding the allelic combinations present on a range of AH (Cascino et al. 1993a;Milner and Campbell 1992).

Five microsatellites have been identified and characterized in the human TNF locus (Udalova et al. 1993). Two of them, (AC/GT) n and (TC/GA) k , designated TNFa and TNFb, are closely linked and located 3.5 kilobases (kb) telomeric to the TNF b-gene (Jongeneel et al. 1991;Nedospasov et al. 1991). These microsatellites have been typed in a wide range of AH (Abraham et al. 1993;Degli-Esposti et al. 1995). In this study, we investigate the suitability of the HSP70 and TNF microsatellite markers in the mapping of a possible susceptibility gene in IBM. 

Materials and methods

DNA and patient samples

We took advantage of the availability of genomic DNA from a series of transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines from the 4th Asia-Oceania Histocompatibility Workshop (4AOHW) which are homozygous for a range of well-defined AH (Table 1). These DNA samples were obtained from the Department of Clinical Immunology, Royal Perth Hospital, Western Australia. Blood samples were obtained from 13 patients with IBM who attended the neuromuscular clinic at Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, Western Australia. Blood samples from a further five patients were obtained from the Department of Neurology, Royal Melbourne Hospital. DNA was extracted using standard phenol/ chloroform/isoamyl alcohol techniques. All 18 patients were Caucasoid and had the characteristic pattern of muscle involvement seen in IBM. Only one patient had shown response to corticosteroid treatment. The diagnosis of IBM was confirmed by muscle biopsy of all patients, which demonstrated the presence of rimmed vacuoles and, where electron-microscopy was performed, the characteristic 18-to 20-nm tubulofilamentous inclusions.

Primers and amplification

The HSP70 fragments of interest were amplified with the following primers:

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction mixtures for HSP70-1 and HSP70-2 contained 100 ng (HSP70-1) and 200 ng (HSP70-2) genomic DNA; 1.0 mM primers; 1.5 mM MgCl 2 ; 200 mM dNTPs; and 1 unit of Tth Plus DNA polymerase (Biotech International, Perth, Australia) in 1X reaction buffer (25 ml total volume) and for HSP70-Hom contained 400 ng genomic DNA; 0.4 mM primers; 2.0 mM MgCl 2 ; 200 mM dNTPs; and 1 unit of Tth Plus DNA polymerase in 1X reaction buffer (25 ml total volume). Amplification was accomplished by 30 cycles of incubation at 94 7C for 1 min, 60 7C for 1 min, and 72 7C for 2 min (1 min for HSP70-1).

The TNF microsatellites were amplified with the following primers:

The forward primers were labeled with HEX (TNFa) or FAM (TNFb) fluorescent dyes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). PCR reaction mixture contained 200 ng genomic DNA; 250 nM primers; 200 mM dNTPs; 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.5 unit Tth Plus DNA polymerase in 1X reaction buffer (20 ml total volume).

The mixture was incubated at 94 7C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of amplification at 94 7C for 30 s, 60 7C for 60 s and 72 7C for 60 s.

Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of HSP70-2 and HSP70-Hom

HSP70-2 and HSP70-Hom PCR products were extracted with phenol/chloroform and digested with Pst I (HSP70-2) and Nco I (HSP70-Hom), respectively. The digested products were then fractionated on 1.5% agarose gels in Tris-acetate/ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) (TAE) electrophoresis buffer.

Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of HSP70-1

HSP70-1 PCR products were denatured at 94 7C for 3 min after the addition of formamide loading buffer. The denatured products were chilled on ice and fractionated on 0.8X non-denaturing mutation detection enhancement (MDE) gels (FMC Bioproducts, Me.) in 0.6X Tris-borate/EDTA (TBE) electrophoresis buffer.

Electrophoresis was performed at 125 V for 4-5 h at room temperature.

Genescan analysis of TNF microsatellites

PCR products containing the TNF microsatellites were resolved on a ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyser (PE Applied Biosystems, Perkin Elmer). One microliter of each PCR product was diluted in 12 ml deionized formamide and 0.5 ml Genescan-350 Tamra standard (Perkin Elmer) and denatured for 3 min at 94 7C before loading. Microsatellite analysis was carried out using ABI Prism Genescan 2.0.2 software. 

Result

RFLP and SSCP typing of the HSP70 genes Nucleotide sequence differences in the common alleles of the HSP70 genes have been documented (Milner and Campbell, 1992), enabling us to select the relevant polymorphic sites for our study. In HSP70-2 and HSP70-Hom the polymorphic Pst I (Goate et al. 1987;Milner and Campbell 1990) and Nco I (Milner and Campbell 1992) sites were selected, respectively (Fig. 1A).

We developed a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay to detect the single base polymorphism at nucleotide position (np) -110 of HSP70-1. Haplotypes marked by HLA-DR3/-B8 and HLA-DR3/ 

1 Y denotes the presence and N denotes the absence of a Pst I site at np 1262 2 Y denotes the presence and N denotes the absence of an Nco I site at np 2434 -B18 have a C at np -110 of HSP70-1, while the HLA DR2/B7 and DR5/B35 haplotypes have an A at the same position (Milner and Campbell 1992). We demonstrated that it was possible to detect this single base polymorphism by using PCR-SSCP (Fig. 1B). Subsequent analysis by sequencing of the HSP70-1 PCR products (data not shown) confirmed that the band of higher mobility (lower band) contained an A, while the band of lower mobility (higher band) had a C, at np -110.

Allelic combinations in the HSP70 genes

Of the 16 different AH analyzed, six had the Pst I restriction site in the HSP70-2 gene, 11 had an A at np -110 in the HSP70-1 gene and 13 had the Nco I restriction site in the HSP70-Hom gene (Table 2). Of the eight possible three-point HSP70 allelic combinations, five were demonstrable in the cell lines tested.

Genescan typing of TNF microsatellites

Microsatellite polymorphisms at the TNF loci have also been well documented (Nedospasov et al. 1991;Udalova et al. 1993). Here we modified the existing methods for microsatellite typing to give a relatively easy and accurate protocol. The TNFa and TNFb microsatellites were selected in this study. The ABI Prism Genescan 2.0.2 software presents results in the form of electrophoretograms which separate PCR products according to size in base pairs (Fig. 2, Table 3A). The microsatellite-containing PCR product was represented by the highest peak.

We analyzed 12 different AH and recorded the size of the highest peak from each electrophoretogram (Table 3A). Allele designations were determined with reference to previous published data (Abraham et al. 1993;Degli-Esposti et al. 1995).

Consistent screening of TNF microsatellite polymorphism

We tested the reproducibility of our typing protocol by comparing PCR duplicates of the same sample and products from different cell lines that carry similar AH. The size difference between the products derived from these different samples was less than 0.09 bp (Table 3B). We also traced the segregation of the TNFa and TNFb microsatellites in two families with known HLA typing. The microsatellites were inherited as stable alleles in the Mendelian fashion (Fig. 3).

The HSP70 and TNF markers in patients with IBM

We extended our analysis of the HSP70 and TNF allelic combinations into a panel of patients with IBM. These subjects were typed for the HLA-DR, C4A, and HLA-B alleles as previously reported (Garlepp et al. 1994). All 18 subjects had HLA-DR3, 15 had C4A * Q0, and 14 had HLA-B8 (Table 4). Prediction of the allelic combinations carried by these heterozygous samples was made with reference to the results obtained with the homozygous cell lines and previous published data (Abraham et al. 1993;Degli-Esposti et al. 1995). The  HSP70 * 2 allelic combination was demonstrated in 16 subjects and excluded from 2 (Table 4). Twelve subjects carried the TNFa2b3 allelic combination characteristic of the 8.1 AH and one carried TNFa3b3.

The allelic markers we had defined for HLA-DR/ C4A/HSP70/TNF/HLA-B were utilized to map for common regions between HLA-DR and -B in the patients with IBM. The criteria for the selection of subjects in this analysis included: caucasoid origin, complete information regarding the markers, confirmation of disease by muscle biopsy, and presence of the 8.1 AH or parts of the haplotype. Of the 18 subjects se-  lected, 10 had the complete HLA-DR3/C4A * Q0/ HSP70 * 2/TNFa2b3/HLA-B8 extended haplotype (8.1 AH). One subject carried HLA-DR3/C4A * Q0/ HSP70 * 2/TNFa3b3/HLA-B8, which could be a variant of the 8.1 AH. The rest carried parts of the extended haplotype (Fig. 4). We found a common region shared by these patients betweenHLA-DR and the region centromeric to C4.

Discussion

There have been several previous reports of HLA association, particularly HLA-DR3, with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, idiopathic nephropathy, Grave's disease, chronic hepatitis, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (Bertrams and Baur 1984;Svejgaard et al. 1983). Although IBM has not been confirmed to be autoimmune in nature, its strong association with HLA-DR3 suggested a role for the human MHC in the predisposition to the disease. Preliminary observations that our IBM patients share the region between HLA-DR and -B prompted us to map for a susceptibility gene in this region. HLA-DR, -B, and complement C4 typing of the patients were readily available. In the current study, we investigated two other markers in the HSP70 and TNF loci and used these markers to map for a possible IBM susceptibility gene. Polymorphisms in the three MHC-related HSP70 genes have been well documented (Cascino et al. 1993b;Milner and Campbell 1992). The polymorphic -110 (HSP70-1), Pst I (HSP70-2), and Nco I (HSP-Hom) sites were selected and used collectively as a marker in our study. Five allelic combinations were demonstrable in the homozygous cell lines tested (Table 2). Three of these combinations were found on more than one AH. Thus these combinations of poly-Fig. 4 A map of the possible IBM susceptibility locus in the human MHC. Shaded area represents the occurrence of the 8.1 AH-associated alleles morphic sites in the HSP70 genes are haplotypic (characteristic of the AH on which they are found) but not haplospecific (found on only a single AH). Of interest was the observation that one of the two cell lines homozygous for HLA-DRB1 * 0102/-B14 was heterozygous at HSP70-2. This resulted in the definition of a fifth HSP70 allelic combination (HSP70 * 5) which occurred only in this cell line. These cell lines (100131A and 100315Q) were identical with respect to alleles at the TNF and PERB1 loci (Degli-Esposti et al. 1995). Complement typing was unavailable for cell line 100315Q, but 100131A had a complotype consistent with homozygosity for the 65.1 AH (Zhang et al. 1990). It is not known whether the HSP70 * 5 allelic combination seen on one of the putative 65.1 AH represents a recombination event with a separate AH or whether this represents a unique AH marked by HLA-B14/ -DR1. Interestingly though, this AH has been shown to carry homoduplication or gene conversion-like changes in the complement region (Bruun-Petersen et al. 1982;Raum, et al. 1984). Whether the allelic combinations which were found on only one AH (HSP70 * 4 and * 5) are haplospecific will be determined by an analysis of a wider panel of AH. Our data confirm the invariable cooccurrence on the same haplotype of the 8.5 kb HSP70-2 RFLP and the C at position -110 of the HSP70-1 gene (Cascino et al. 1993b).

Variation in the microsatellite length by itself apparently does not affect gene structure or regulation (Nedospasov et al. 1991). However, microsatellites are highly informative as markers of gene polymorphism because of their multiallelic nature. In this study the TNF microsatellites, TNFa and TNFb, were selected. We modified the existing methods for microsatellite typing to give an easy protocol with the accuracy of less than 1 bp difference. This method is highly reproducible between samples with the same microsatellite length and between runs (Table 3B). The sizes of the microsatellites reported here are slightly different from the published sizes, but the difference in allelic microsatellite sizes in our study is consistent with those pre-viously published (Abraham et al. 1993;Nedospasov et al. 1991). In cases where the peaks appeared to have migrated further than expected, a corresponding shift was observed for the primer peaks (data not shown). Thus the primer peak acts as an internal control. The 2 bp difference in the TNFa microsatellite products generated from cell lines 100044V and 100045T (Table 3B), both homozygous for HLA-DRB1 * 0301/-B8, could be a result of the "slippage" of DNA polymerase during DNA replication. This was also observed in previous experiments using these and other cell lines (Abraham et al. 1993;Udalova et al. 1993).

Having identified the markers that were potentially informative, we proceeded to test a panel of patients with IBM. Our mapping strategy relied strongly on the linkage disequilibrium between alleles in the human MHC. A similar strategy was employed to localize the region which contained the susceptibility loci for IDDM (Degli-Esposti et al. 1992a). AH, including probable recombinant AH, have also been implicated in other diseases such as myasthenia gravis (Degli-Esposti et al. 1992c), cystic fibrosis (Kerem et al. 1989), and Werner syndrome (Goddard et al. 1996). The increased prevalence of the HLA-DR3 and -B8 markers in patients with IBM suggested that the 8.1 AH is associated with this disease. In this study, we found 16 of 18 subjects carrying the haplotypic HSP70 * 2 allelic combination and 12 the characteristic TNFa2b3 allelic combination (Table 4). The only other known AH that carries TNFa2b3 is the 58.1 AH, which is considered to be the Mongoloid equivalent of the Caucasoid 8.1 AH (Abraham et al. 1993). Thus these combinations are most probably part of the 8.1 AH in these heterozygous subjects. One subject (16) carried the mutant TNFa3b3 and was considered a variant of the 8.1 AH (Table 4).

Although AH are highly conserved, changes due to historical recombinations between AH are not uncommon. These recombinant AH could be used to localize the gene or genes responsible for a disease in the MHC. From our panel of patients we were able to identify recombinant AH by mapping the region between HLA-DR and -B with the HLA-DR/C4A/HSP70/TNF/HLA-B markers. Eleven subjects had the complete HLA-DR3/C4A * Q0/HSP70 * 2/TNFa2b3(TNFa3b3)/HLA-B8 haplotype characteristic of the 8.1 AH (Table 4). Seven other subjects had potentially informative recombinant AH. Three of the recombinants carried the centromeric features of the 8.1 AH, two of which extended beyond HSP70 but not as far as TNF (subjects 13 and 14) and one extended beyond HLA-DR but not as far as C4A (subject 18). Interesting observations were made concerning subjects 12, 15, 16, and 17. Subject 12 had the HLA-DR3, C4A * Q0,and HLA-B8 markers but lacked the HSP70 * 2 and TNFa2b3 markers. Subjects 15 and 16 lacked TNFa2b3 and C4A * Q0, respectively. In these subjects, the recombination event seemed to have taken place in the central regions (Fig. 4). In the case of subject 17, the missing markers C4A * Q0 and HLA-B8 suggested a double recombination event, one at the telomeric end and the other around the complement region. With the seven recombinants that fulfilled the criteria of our mapping strategy, we are able to map the possible susceptibility gene or genes of IBM to the region between HLA-DR and the region centromeric to C4.

A few genes in the delineated regions are candidates for further study. We are currently investigating the gene encoding the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) which is located approximately 150 kb centromeric to the C4 gene. RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules and acts as a binding site for advanced glycation end products which are formed as a consequence of irreversible glycation of protein or lipids (Schmidt et al. 1992). This receptor has also been demonstrated to bind the bA4 fragment of the amyloid precursor protein which is associated with the rimmed vacuoles of skeletal muscle in IBM and the plaques in the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increased expression of RAGE has been demonstrated in the brain in AD (Yan et al. 1996) and the in vitro binding of bA4 to RAGE expressed in neurons has been shown to be neurotoxic (Yan et al. 1996). Thus aberrant expression or function of this gene may influence these diseases.
