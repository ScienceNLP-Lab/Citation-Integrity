Myostatin precursor protein is increased and associates with amyloid-? precursor protein in inclusion-body myositis culture model

Myostatin, also called growth and differentiation factor-8, is a member of the transforming growth factor-b superfamily [1,2]. Myostatin is a secreted protein considered a negative regulator of muscle growth during development and of muscle mass during adulthood [1]. In mouse models, knocking out the myostatin gene, overexpressing proteins neutralizing myostatin, or natural mutations of the myostatin gene cause increased muscle mass [1]. In cattle, naturally occurring myostatin gene mutations leading to inactive protein cause 'double-muscle cattle' [2]. Recently reported was a child in whom a homozygous myostatin gene mutation that results in reduced production of myostatin protein, was associated with increased muscle bulk and strength [3]. Conversely, mature myostatin protein has been reported increased in muscle tissue of patients with HIV-associated muscle wasting [4], and increased myostatin-precursor protein (MstnPP) mRNA reported in muscle wasting associated with osteoarthritis [5].

Within muscle fibres, myostatin is synthesized as a MstnPP [6,7]. MstnPP and its mRNA, and mature myostatin, are predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle tissue (reviewed in [1]). MstnPP, a 375-amino-acid protein translated from a 3.1 kb mRNA [4], consists of three structural domains: a signal sequence; an N-terminal 28 kDa propeptide, also referred to as latency associated peptide [7]; and a C-terminal 12 kDa mature myostatin peptide [6,7]. Intracellular processing of myostatin from MstnPP has been proposed to occur through furin [6,8].

We recently showed in biopsied sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) muscle fibres that both MstnPP and myostatin dimer were significantly increased, and MstnPP was physically associated with amyloid-b precursor protein (AbPP) [9]. Moreover, by light-and electron-microscopic immunocytochemistry, MstnPP/myostatin colocalized with amyloid-b (Ab)/AbPP [9]. s-IBM is severely progressive, the most common muscle disease of older persons, and there is no successful treatment [10]. Histological hallmarks of s-IBM include: (1) vacuolar degeneration and atrophy of muscle fibres, accompanied by intramuscle-fibre accumulations of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, including Ab/AbPP; (2) muscle-fibre atrophy; and (3) mononuclear lymphocytic inflammation [10][11][12]. Recently demonstrated in s-IBM muscle fibres were inhibition of 26S proteasome activity and presence of aggresomes [13]. Accumulation of AbPP/Ab appears to be an early upstream step in the s-IBM pathogenesis, because: (i) abnormal accumulation of AbPP epitopes appears to precede other abnormalities in IBM muscle fibres [11]; and (ii) several aspects of the s-IBM phenotype, including Ab accumulation, proteasome inhibition and aggresome formation, were produced in cultured normal human muscle fibres (CHMFs) after long-term overexpression of AbPP in them [13][14][15]. The latter provides a useful IBM human-muscle tissue-culture model. The aim of the present study was to utilize this model to investigate possible mechanisms responsible for increased MstnPP and myostatin within the biopsied s-IBM muscle fibres. We cultured human muscle fibres from satellite cells obtained from six normal diagnostic muscle biopsies, as described [13][14][15] and referenced therein. Into well-differentiated 3-week-old cultured muscle fibres we transferred a 3 kb human AbPP-cDNA encoding 751-AbPP using a replication-deficient adenovirus vector at 0.3 ¥ 10 8 pfu/ml culture medium, as detailed previously [14,15]. In addition, we treated some of the cultures with 1 mm epoxomicin (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) [13], an irreversible proteasome inhibitor [16]. Four days after AbPP gene transfer and 24 h after epoxomicin treatment, control and AbPP-overexpressing CHMFs (AbPP+ CHMFs) were processed for light-and electron-microscopic immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as described [13][14][15]17]. For all the myostatin studies, we used an anti-myostatin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA), which was shown to be highly specific in our studies and in studies by others [4,9,18]. On immunoblots, this antibody recognizes both a 55 kDa band of MstnPP and a 26 kDa band of mature myostatin dimer, and by immunocytochemistry it recognizes both MstnPP/myostatin [9]. For AbPP/Ab studies, we used a well-characterized mouse monoclonal 6E10 antibody (Signet, Dedham, MA, USA), diluted 1:100, which morphologically recognizes Ab/AbPP in both s-IBM muscle fibres and Alzheimer's disease brain [19,20], and by immunoblots recognizes both AbPP and Ab [19,20].

• Single-and double-labelled immunofluorescence was performed as described [13][14][15], using anti-myostatin antibody diluted 1:100 and 6E10 diluted 1:150. Mouse monoclonal antibody against g-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), diluted 1:50, was used to identify aggresomes. • Double-labelled gold-immuno-electronmicroscopy was performed on nonproteasome-inhibited AbPP+ CHMFs as previously detailed [13][14][15], using the same antibodies discussed above. • For immunoblotting, cultured muscle fibres were harvested in RIPA buffer, homogenized, and protein concentration measured using the Bradford method [9,13,17]. Denatured 40 mg protein samples were loaded onto 10% NuPage gels, electrophoresed in MOPS-SDS buffer, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoprobed overnight with anti-myostatin antibody diluted 1:500. After incubation with appropriate secondary antibody, blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system. Protein loading was evaluated by actin bands visualized with a mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Quantification of immunoreactivity was performed by densitometric analysis using the Kodak-GelLogic-440 system (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY, USA). • We performed a combined immunoprecipitationimmunoblotting, as described [9,13], to evaluate whether MstnPP physically associates with AbPP/Ab. In brief, 100 mg of homogenized protein from AbPP+ CHMFs was immunoprecipitated with either 5 mg of 6E10 antibody or anti-myostatin antibody. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 20 ml of protein-G-Sepharose-4 fast flow (Amersham-Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ, USA), washed, denatured, separated by electrophoresis, transferred to membranes, and immunoprobed with either anti-myostatin or 6E10 antibody, and then with appropriate secondary antibody, and developed. • For RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated and processed as described [17]. One microgram of RNA was used in the RT-PCR reaction utilizing the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), with either primers (i) for MstnPP (Fw-GTGGTACCTCATGCAAAAACTGCAACT CTGT; Rv-ATGGATCCAATCTCATGAGCACCCACAGC), or (ii) for GAPDH [21]. The PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and stained with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The conditions of the reactions were experimentally checked to ensure that signals were in the linear range of the PCR. Our immunofluorescence results revealed very weak cytoplasmic staining of MstnPP/myostatin within control CHMFs, and much stronger, mainly diffuse, cytoplasmic staining in AbPP+ CHMFs (Figure 1A,B). In 70-80% of the epoxomicin-treated AbPP+ CHMFs, strong MstnPP/ myostatin immunoreactivity was present in the form of aggregates, which also contained Ab/AbPP (Figure 1C,D). Their immuno-colocalization with g-tubulin indicated that MstnPP/myostatin immunoreactive aggregates were aggresomes [13] (Figure 1E,F). By gold-immuno- electronmicroscopy, within AbPP+ CHMFs, both MstnPP/ myostatin and Ab/AbPP were associated together with 6-10 nm fibrils (Figure 2A) and with amorphous and floccular material (Figure 2B,C). We have previously proposed that 6-10 nm fibrils reflect a b-pleated-sheet amyloid, while amorphous and floccular material may represent preamyloid [22] Additionally, both Ab/AbPP and MstnPP/ myostatin were immunolocalized perinuclearly (Figure 2D). Immunoblots demonstrated that in our AbPP+ CHMFs a 55 kDa MstnPP was increased 2.3fold (P < 0.01) as compared with control cultures (Figure 3A,B), but according to our semiquantative RT-PCR study there was no significant difference in the amount of MstnPP mRNA between control and AbPP+ CHMFs (Figure 3C,D). Mature myostatin was not apparent on our immunoblots, which is consistent with a recent study demonstrating that in well-differentiated myotubes of C2C12 mouse cell-line, as well as in bovine myotubes, mature myostatin was not detected on immunoblots [8].

Proteasome inhibition did not appear to influence the amount of MstnPP (Figure 3A,B), but MstnPP mRNA was decreased 2.5-fold (P < 0.01) as compared with controls (Figure 3C,D).

The combined immunoprecipitation-immunoblot procedure showed that, in our IBM culture model, MstnPP and AbPP coimmunoprecipitate (Figure 3E,F ), similarly to s-IBM muscle biopsies [9].

The present study provides a novel demonstration in cultured human muscle that overexpression of AbPP/Ab increases accumulation of MstnPP. Accordingly, this mechanism might be, at least partially, responsible for the increase of MstnPP and of mature myostatin in the biopsied s-IBM muscle fibres [9]. Whether lack of detectable mature myostatin dimer in our model (i) reflects its secretion to the culture medium, or (ii) is related to the sensitivity of our antibody remains to be studied.

The mechanism(s) by which AbPP/Ab increases MstnPP is presently not known. One possibility is that AbPP binding to MstnPP causes its posttranslational modification that lessens its degradation and traffic, resulting in its accumulation. This possibility would accord with the fact that in proteasome-inhibited CHMFs there is no decrease in the total amount of MstnPP despite its significantly decreased mRNA.

It is currently not definitely known whether the ubiquitin-proteasome system participates in MstnPP degradation, but in our proteasome-inhibited CHMFs, MstnPP was accumulated in aggresomes, which probably impairs its traffic and degradation.

Even though in our study AbPP/Ab overexpression does not appear to influence MstnPP mRNA, a possible enhancement of MstnPP transcription might be masked by a proteasome inhibition produced by AbPP overexpression [13], and, as we have discussed above, MstnPP mRNA is decreased by proteasome inhibition. Collectively, the data in our current study support the proposal that in s-IBM muscle fibres, abnormalities of AbPP/Ab precede increased MstnPP/myostatin [9]. As excessive myostatin may contribute to human muscle-fibre atrophy (see above), therapeutically inhibiting MstnPP or myostatin might be beneficial in various neuromuscular disorders associated with atrophy. Our culture system should provide a useful model to study regulatory mechanisms of MstnPP production and its processing in human muscle. And this culture model might be useful in developing new treatment strategies to mitigate myostatin and its effects.
