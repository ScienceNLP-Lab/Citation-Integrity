Oligoclonal expansion of muscle infiltrating T cells in inclusion body myositis

Inclusion body myositis IBM is the most common muscle disease affecting individuals over 50 years of age. An important feature of Ž . IBM is invasion of muscle fibers by T cells. The muscle infiltrating T cells show a restricted usage of variable V arb gene families. In this study we have investigated the clonality of T cells using two of the predominant Vb families i.e. Vb 3 and Vb 8 in three patients with Ž . IBM. The study was performed by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR analysis, followed by cloning and sequencing of the T cell receptor complementarity determining region 3. We found oligoclonal expansion of Vb 3 bearing muscle infiltrating T cells in two patients and of Vb 8 in one patient, supporting the concept that antigen stimulated T cells are important in the pathogenesis of IBM. Results of HLA typing indicated a genetic predisposition for the disease by the presence of DR3, DR52 and DQB1 ) 0201r0202 in all three patients. q 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction

Ž

. Inclusion body myositis IBM is a chronic progressive inflammatory myopathy, which is the most common muscle disease presenting in patients older than 50 years Ž . Askanas and Engel, 1995 . Clinically, the disorder is characterized by progressive weakness of proximal and distal muscles and resistance to steroid treatment eventually leading to severe disability and in some patients respiratory insufficiency.

Morphologically IBM is characterized by muscle fibers with rimmed vacuoles, congophilic deposits and inclusions consisting of filaments measuring 15-21 nm in diameter Ž . Askanas and Engel, 1995;Griggs et al., 1995 . In addi-Ž tion, there are infiltrations of T lymphocytes Hohlfeld and .

recently shown that there is a limited usage of T cell Ž . Ž . Ž receptor TCR variable V genes in IBM Lindberg et al., . 1994;O'Hanlon et al., 1994;Fyhr et al., 1996 . We have reported increased occurrence of TCR Vb 3 and Vb 8 gene families within population of muscle infiltrating lymphocytes. Similar finding regarding TCR Vb 3 was also re-Ž . ported by O'Hanlon et al. 1994 . Therefore Vb 3 and Vb 8 gene families might be of special interest in IBM. This study was performed to investigate clonality of local T cell responses with special emphasis on the antigen binding Ž . hypervariable complementarity determining region CDR3 region of muscle infiltrating T cells expressing TCR Vb 3 and Vb 8 in selected patients with IBM.

Results

Altogether 78 different T cell clones were identified by analysis of 163 different bacterial colonies, which were used for cloning. The results from sequencing the CDR3 region are shown in Fig. 1. The CDR3 region was set Ž . according to Moss and Bell 1995 and was defined as the amino acids between the conserved serine at the end of the TCR Vb and the conserved phenylalanine in the TCR Jb segment.

Patient 1 showed an oligoclonal pattern for Vb 3 expressing T cells. Six different sequences were present among 30 sequenced clones and 19 clones were identical. One of these sequences was TSG combined with Jb 2.7 which occurred in 4 of the 30 clones and this combination was also found in patient 3 where it was present in 7 of 24 clones. Vb 8 expressing T cells of patient 1 showed a polyclonal pattern with 27 different sequences among the 32 analyzed clones. TCR Jb 2 families predominated in TCR Vb 3 expressing T cells and only 4 of 30 clones belonged to Jb 1 families. On the contrary Jb 1 was predominating in Vb 8 expressing T cells, where 22 of 32 clones belonged to TCR Jb 1 families. The average length of the CDR3 region was 12.4 amino acids for Vb 3 and 10.6 amino acids for Vb 8.

In patient 2 TCR Vb 3 as well as Vb 8 expressing T cells showed an oligoclonal pattern. Vb 3 expressing cells showed six different sequences of 27 sequenced clones and 22 were identical. Vb 8 expressing T cells showed seven different sequences of 25 sequenced clones and 16 sequences were identical. The Jb 1.5 family was present in the 22 identical clones of Vb 3 expressing lymphocytes while the other 5 clones belonged to two Jb 2 families. TCR Vb 8 bearing cells used different Jb 1 families in 20 of 25 clones. The average length of the CDR3 region was 10.1 amino acids for Vb 3 and 9.7 amino acids for Vb 8.

The result of sequencing 24 clones of TCR Vb 3 in patient 3 showed 12 different sequences and 7 clones were identical. Twenty different sequences were present among 25 sequences expressing TCR Vb 8 and 5 clones were identical. TCR Jb 1 segment was infrequent and only 3 of 24 TCR Vb 3 belonged to Jb 1 families. TCR Vb 8 expressing cells used Jb 1 families in 6 of 25 clones. The average length of the CDR3 region was 10.0 amino acids for Vb 3 and 11.0 amino acids for Vb 8.

Immunohistochemical staining in patient 2 and 3 showed presence of Vb 3 and Vb 8 expressing T cells in inflamma-Ž . tory cell infiltrates Fig. 2 . In patient 1 no immunohistochemical stainings were performed due to insufficient frozen muscle tissue. The result of the HLA typing is presented in Table 2. All three patients showed presence of A1, B8, Cw7, DR3, DR52 and DQB1 ) 0201r0202.

Discussion

In previous studies it has been shown that there is a diverse but restricted usage of TCR Vb families in muscle Ž tissue of IBM patients Lindberg et al., 1994;O'Hanlon et . al., 1994;Fyhr et al., 1996 . A limited usage of Vb gene families have also been demonstrated in other tissuespecific autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis Ž . Ž Hingorani et al., 1996 andmultiple sclerosis Hafler et . al., 1996 . In this study we demonstrate that the expression of predominant TCR Vb-gene families in IBM is due to oligoclonal expansion as well as polyclonal infiltration of T cells.

Thus, in two of the patients investigated there was an oligoclonal expansion of Vb 3 and in one patient of Vb 8 expressing T cells. This oligoclonal expansion pattern may be explained by antigen-specific response as well as activation by one or more superantigens. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated in situ T cell proliferation in muscle Ž . of IBM patients Lindberg et al., 1995 . This local oligoclonal T cell expansion may be explained by so far unidentified antigens in muscle tissue in IBM. In fact, several proteins are pathologically accumulated in muscle fibers, e.g. b-amyloid, ubiquitin, apolipoprotein E, prion protein Ž and hyperphosphorylated tau Askanas andEngel, 1993, . 1995;Gambetti and Perry, 1995 . These and other normally expressed muscle proteins are candidate antigens in further research on the pathogenesis of inflammation in IBM. Superantigens activate a polyclonal population of T Ž . cells expressing certain Vb families Herman et al., 1991 . The finding of a polyclonal population of Vb 8 expressing T cells in patient 1 may be due to a superantigen stimulation but multiple antigenic stimulation could be another possibility explaining the polyclonal pattern. Patients 1 and 3 showed one common Vb 3 sequence at the amino acid level and one may speculate if this finding indicates a common antigen stimulation in these two patients. Since the recognition of an antigen by the T cell is not only dependent on the antigen structure but also on the MHC Ž . structure Gulwani-Akolkar et al., 1991 we have analyzed the HLA expression to identify possible similarities. Interestingly we found in all three patients presence of A1, B8, Cw7, DR3, DR52 and DQB1 ) 0201r0202. A strong association with DR3 in IBM has previously been demon- Fyhr et al.r Journal of Neuroimmunology 79 1997 185-189 189 Ž . strated by Garlepp et al. 1994 and may indicate a genetic predisposition for the disease.

This study was restricted to two of the Vb families expressed among muscle infiltrating T cells. To establish the importance of oligoclonal versus polyclonal T cell infiltration all expressed Vb families should be investigated, which may be accomplished by RT-PCR analysis Ž . followed by fragment length analysis Even et al., 1995 . It is also important to establish whether the same T cell clones predominate in all affected muscles and to what extension they could also be retrieved in the peripheral blood.

The identification of the clonally expanded T cell populations in affected muscles provide basis for specific ther-Ž apy directed to pathogenic T cells clones Hafler et al., . 1996 . Immunization with TCR peptides has been shown to be an efficient treatment procedure in e.g. experimental Ž . Ž autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE Vandenbark et al., . 1996 although the opposite effects have been reported Ž . Desquenne-Clark et al., 1991 . The novel discovery of suppressive vaccination with DNA encoding a variable gene of the TCR in EAE may be another therapeutic Ž . approach in future Waisman et al., 1996 .
