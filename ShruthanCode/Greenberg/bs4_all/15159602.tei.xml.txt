Apolipoprotein E and Alpha-1-Antichymotrypsin Polymorphisms in Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis

Sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) is a progressive muscle disease of unknown aetiology. Characteristically, intracellular amyloid deposits are detectable, including ß-amyloid precursor protein, phosphorylated tau, • 1 -antichymotrypsin (• 1 -ACT) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Polymorphisms and mutations of the encoding genes have been identified in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Beside other factors, polymorphisms may lead to protein accumulation in both diseases. In particular, polymorphisms within the ApoE and • 1 -ACT gene have been implicated in the aetiology of AD and s-IBM. We analysed ApoE and • 1 -ACT gene polymorphisms in 35 s-IBM patients. We could not identify any statistical significant correlation between distinct ApoE and • 1 -ACT genotypes and the risk of developing s-IBM. Additionally, ApoE and • 1 -ACT genotypes seem not to influence the onset age of s-IBM. A combination of different • 1 -ACT and ApoE genotypes appears not to enhance the risk of develop-ing s-IBM. Therefore, allelic variations of • 1 -ACT and ApoE are unlikely to be genetic key factors in the aetiology of s-IBM.

Introduction

Sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) is recognized as the most common muscle disease that starts after the age of 50. s-IBM is of unknown cause and unconfirmed pathogenesis [1,2]. Microscopically, muscle biopsies are characterized by inflammation, 'rimmed vacuoles' and characteristic cytoplasmic and nuclear filamentous inclusions. Ultrastructurally, 15-to 18-nm tubulofilaments are present [1,2]. Clinically, patients suffer from a slowly progressive inflammatory myopathy, which finally leads to severe disability. The muscle weakness is distal and proximal in the lower and upper limbs. The forearm muscles and the musculus quadriceps femoris are typically affected. Dysphagia is a common clinical feature whereas respiratory muscle weakness can be found occasionally [3][4][5].

An astounding aspect of the s-IBM muscle fibre histological phenotype is its similarity to that of the Alzhei-Gossrau/Gestrich/Koch/Wunderlich/ Schröder/Schroeder/Reichmann/Lampe mer's disease (AD) brain [6,7]. Several proteins found in amyloid plaques typical of AD accumulate in s-IBM muscle fibres, including apolipoprotein E (ApoE), • 1 -antichymotrypsin (• 1 -ACT), prion protein, hyperphosphorylated tau, presenilin 1, ubiquitin, ß-amyloid (Aß) and ß-amyloid precursor protein [8,9]. Moreover, tubulofilaments found in s-IBM resemble AD neurofibrillary tangles [10]. These points questioned the analogies in degenerative processes between AD and s-IBM [6].

ApoE is physically associated with extracellular senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in AD. ApoE as a plasma protein is produced and secreted in the central nervous system by astrocytes [11]. It is involved in the transport of cholesterol, which may in part explain the link between certain ApoE alleles and the risk of developing AD. ApoE is implicated in the growth and repair of the nervous system during development or after injury [12].

So far certain polymorphisms of the ApoE may lead to functionally different gene products with unequal repair properties and interactions with molecular chaperones in the nervous system as well as in other organs.

ApoE accumulates abnormally within s-IBM muscle fibres [13]. It is localized by means of light microscopy in intracellular inclusions that closely colocalize with phosphorylated tau and Aß [14]. Interestingly, ApoE binds to Aß and ß-pleated-sheet amyloid produced by various proteins in vitro [6,[15][16][17]. On the other hand, ApoE mRNA

has not yet been described in s-IBM muscle fibres. Therefore it is likely that the ApoE accumulation arises from the import of circulating protein into muscle fibres and its subsequent binding to Aß [14].

An increased frequency of the ApoE Â4 allele is associated with earlier onset of sporadic and late-onset familial AD [18][19][20]. In s-IBM patients one group demonstrated an increase in the ApoE Â4 allele frequency [21], which could not be confirmed by two different groups [22,23].

• 1 -ACT inhibits serine proteases and belongs to the serpin superfamily. It is considered a major acute-phase protein. Further proposed functions are control of connective-tissue breakdown and cell-to-cell interactions as well as inhibition of natural killer cell activity [24]. Abnormal • 1 -ACT accumulation has been described in amyloid plaques of AD brains [25]. Because of the close associations with Aß, it may possibly play a role in amyloid fibril formation. As in the AD brain, • 1 -ACT closely colocalizes with Aß in s-IBM muscle [26].

In view of the morphochemical similarities between AD and s-IBM, the question of the possible relevance in terms of common pathogenic pathways in both diseases arises.

In s-IBM CD8+ cytotoxic T cells infiltrate muscle fibres [4]. Since • 1 -ACT inhibits the natural killer cell activity, a defined polymorphism of this gene might modify its proposed immunomodulatory functions [24].

Certain ApoE and • 1 -ACT polymorphisms have been proposed to be susceptible markers for AD. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate if the segregation of ApoE and • 1 -ACT in patients with s-IBM resemble the proposed aetiopathogenetic similarities in AD and s-IBM.

Methods

A total of 35 German patients (women and men) fulfilling the clinical and histological criteria for definite s-IBM were included. The mean age of the patients was 62.8 years (between 16 and 74). The results were compared with 57 healthy control subjects and formerly published results [19,[27][28][29]. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes (GenomeClean Kit, AGS GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Subsequently, a part of an ApoE gene containing allelic polymorphism at codon 112 and codon 158 was amplified as previously described [30]. The PCR products were CfO digested and separated on a 2% agarose gel, visualized with ethidium bromide staining (fig. 1). The • 1 -ACT allelic polymorphism was determined after amplification of a 124-base-pair gene fragment using the primers CAG AGT TGA GAA TGG AGA (sense) and TTC TCC TGG GTC AGA TTC (antisense). The genomic DNA was amplified under the following conditions: denaturation, 95 °C, 1 min; annealing, 50 °C, 2 min; extension, 72 °C, 1 min. The cycle was repeated 25 times. The PCR products were digested with 5 units of the enzyme MvaI (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), for 1.5 h, at 37 °C and analyzed in an ethidium-bromide-stained 2% agarose gel (peqLab, Erlangen, Germany). Mva-digested PCR products from patients revealed the genotypes A/A, T/T and A/T at the ACT locus.

The resulting ApoE allele frequencies of s-IBM patients were compared with normal control subjects. Because certain ApoE alleles are known to influence the age at AD onset we correlated the ApoE alleles in s-IBM patients with the age of disease onset. Distinct • 1 -ACT alleles have been found to enhance the former stated ApoE effect on disease onset in AD. To see if there is a comparable effect in s-IBM, we correlated • 1 -ACT and ApoE allele expression with age at disease onset [30].

The • 1 -ACT A/A polymorphism confers to the risk of developing AD. We tested the • 1 -ACT allele segregation in s-IBM and compared it with healthy controls.

Statistical analysis was performed using the ¯2 test (p value Mantel-Haenszel corrected). This method has been shown to be a useful approach in describing differences of ApoE and • 1 -ACT allele frequencies in various populations [27][28][29]. In the case of low filled cells, the Fisher exact test was performed for a two-tailed test of the difference.

Results

To sum up, we analysed 35 patients, 24 (68.5%) of whom were male, 11 (31.4%) female. Genotypes of patients and controls are shown in table 1. Table 2 displays the comparison of own data with previously published data. The ApoE Â4 was present in 14.3% of patients and in 11.4% of control subjects (p = 0.761 in Fisher's exact test). 10% of s-IBM patients carried the ApoE Â2 allele compared to 3.5% of the control group. This small difference lacked statistical significance (p = 0.19 in Fisher's exact test). Likewise we did not find any significant differences between s-IBM patients and control subjects regarding the ApoE Â4 allelic distribution. The ApoE Â2/4 genotype was present in 2, the ApoE Â3/4 genotype in 8 and the ApoE Â4/4 genotype in none of 35 patients. No significant difference between patients and control subjects was noticeable.

The mean age at disease onset for all s-IBM patients was 54.5 years (ranging from 16 to 74). The mean age at onset was 46 years for the ApoE Â3/4 bearers and 56 years for the ApoE Â3/3 bearers. One patient with ApoE Â2/4 genotype was aged 70 when the disease started. The mean age of the 3 ApoE Â2/3 carriers was 49 years. We found that the age at disease onset was very similar in the different genotype bearers. The 1 patient carrying ApoE Â2/4 with late disease onset cannot be taken into consideration.

The ACT genotyping results for 29 patients and controls are shown in table 3. We could not find any signifi-  The mean age at disease onset was 54 years for the ACT AA bearers, 50 for the ACT AT carriers and 61 for the 5 ACT TT homozygous patients. So far, the different genotype carriers had nearly the same mean age at disease onset. We investigated whether ApoE and ACT act together to determine an individual's risk of developing s-IBM. The corresponding data are shown in table 4. In s-IBM patients the ACT AA genotype was associated with low frequencies of ApoE Â4 compared to the other 2 genotypes of ACT (p = 0.072 as opposed to p = 0.178 and p = 0.1) and compared to the results of ApoE-Â4-positive ACT AA carriers in the control group (p = 0.072 versus p = 0.0116).

Interestingly, the patients' ACT AA genotype was associated with higher frequencies of the ApoE Â2 allele compared to the AT and TT genotype within the patients' group (0.143 vs. 0.058 and 0) and in contrast to the controls with AA genotype (0.143 vs. 0.038). This last finding is statistically not significant. For respective p values, see table 4. The frequency of the Â4 allele was highest in the ACT AT genotype in s-IBM patients, whereas in the controls similar Â4 counts were shown in the different ACT genotypes. The former differences are not statistically significant.

Discussion

This study was performed to examine the distribution of ApoE and ACT genotypes and its possible relation to disease onset in s-IBM patients.

Various studies pointed to an ApoE-Â4-allele-associated risk of the development of late onset and sporadic AD [31]. Moreover, the ACT AA genotype was found to confer an additional genetic risk of developing AD in a smaller number of studies. However, this finding was questioned in further studies [32,33]. In sporadic and late-onset familial forms of AD, an increased frequency of the ApoE 4 allele is associated with earlier disease onset. In s-IBM patients, Garlepp et al. [21] suggested that the ApoE Â4 allele modifies the risk of developing s-IBM. Some others denied this hypothesis [22,23].

We investigated the possible relationship between the ApoE alleles and s-IBM. The results of our study failed to confirm the findings of Garlepp et al. [21] and are consistent with the results of other groups [21][22][23]. There was no correlation between any ApoE polymorphism and an increased or decreased risk of suffering from s-IBM.

Because of the absence of ApoE mRNA in acute s-IBM affected muscle but not in regenerating muscle, it has been postulated that ApoE reaches the muscle fibres via their low-density lipoprotein receptors [14]. It is likely that ApoE is intracellularly captured by Aß and any ßpleated amyloid [34].

As similar pathogenic pathways of AD and s-IBM are currently discussed, the results of Yang et al. [35] are of interest. They found the ApoE Â4 associated with AD risk to be modified by ACT polymorphisms. Testing this association for s-IBM patients we did not find differences in the disease risk and age at disease onset between different ApoE polymorphism carriers depending on the ACT genotype.

So far, little is known regarding the mechanisms preceding and leading to the formation of the inclusion bodies in s-IBM muscle. Nevertheless, there are some indications that the protein aggregation leading to the formation of inclusions is caused by binding of partially un-or misfolded polypeptides [36][37][38]. Several factors like oxidative stress or aging may lead to this protein un-or misfolding [39,40]. Hypothetically unknown factors that may lead to ß-amyloid precursor protein overexpression in s-IBM muscle can serve as the underlying process [41,42].

ß-Amyloid precursor protein overexpression induces oxidative stress with the formation of free radicals. As a direct consequence of oxidative stress, cyclooxygenase activity is decreased, and several other factors are increased (e.g. glutathione peroxidase, catalase, nitrotyrosine) [43][44][45]. Simultaneously mitochondria are disturbed, leading to mitochondrial abnormalities [46]. Ad-ditionally, the oxidative stress may be responsible for the appearance of vacuolated fibres accompanied by congophilia and the accumulation of neurodegeneration-related proteins (ApoE, • 1 -ACT, phosphorylated tau, ubiquitin, presenilin 1, paired helical filaments) [47].

s-IBM shares biochemical features with AD, including ApoE and ß-amyloid peptide immunoreactivity in affected tissues. In AD, a functional pathogenic role has been suggested for ApoE due to its localization near the disease-defining pathological lesions. Interactions between certain proteins found in neurodegenerative diseases (like ApoE and ACT) and molecular chaperones have been suggested [48,49]. These could serve as nucleating agents in forming amyloid conglomerates. In this respect, the observation that ApoE and ACT genotypes in s-IBM patients do not differ from those of normal controls suggests the accumulation of these proteins in eosinophilic inclusions of affected muscle as an epiphenomenon.
