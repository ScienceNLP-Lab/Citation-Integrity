β-Amyloid Peptide Expression Is Sufficient for Myotube Death: Implications for Human Inclusion Body Myopathy

Inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is the most common disorder of skeletal muscle in aged humans. It shares biochemical features with Alzheimer's disease, including congophilic deposits, which are immunoreactive for ␤-amyloid peptide (A␤) and C-terminal ␤APP epitopes. However, the etiology of myofiber loss and the role of intracellular A␤ in IBM is unknown. Here we report correlative evidence for apoptotic cell death in myofibers of IBM patients that exhibit pronounced A␤ deposition. HSV-1-mediated gene transfer of A␤ 42 into cultured C2C12 myotubes resulted in a 12.6-fold increase in dUTP-labeled and condensed nuclei over nonexpressing myotubes (P < 0.05). The C-terminal ␤APP domain C99 also induced myotube apoptosis, but to a significantly lesser extent than A␤. Apoptosis specific to A␤-expressing myotubes was also demonstrated through DNA fragmentation, decreased mitochondrial function and the loss of membrane phospholipid polarity. Myotubes laden with A␤ 42 , but not other transgene products, developed cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of fibrillar material. Furthermore, injection of normal mouse gastrocnemius muscle with HSV-encoding A␤ cDNA resulted in TUNEL-positive myofibers with pyknotic nuclei. We conclude that A␤ is sufficient to induce apoptosis in myofibers both in vivo and in vitro and suggest it may contribute to myofiber loss and muscle dysfunction in patients with IBM.

INTRODUCTION

Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis is the most common muscle disease of the aged. It is a progressive disorder of insidious onset. Pathologically, inclusion body myositis (IBM) is characterized by rimmed vacuoles composed of ubiquitin, localized by electron microscopy to cytoplasmic tubular filaments and the Alzheimer's disease ␤-amyloid peptide (A␤), localized to amorphous material and 6 -10 nm filaments (Askanas et al., 1992(Askanas et al., , 1993)). Deposits of hyperphosphorylated microtubular protein tau are also found in vacuolated myofibers (Askanas et al., 1994(Askanas et al., , 1996)). The mechanism of cell dysfunction and loss in IBM remains a mystery. Scattered inflammatory infiltrates of variable intensity are commonly observed, yet IBM is refractory to immunosuppressant therapy. Furthermore, the number of vacuolated, ␤-amyloid-bearing myofibers correlate better with the degree of clinical weakness than do the collections of inflammatory cells and inflammatory infiltrates are absent in hereditary IBM (Barohn et al., 1995). Thus, IBM might be an age-related degenerative myopathy with reactive inflammation, rather than primarily an immune disorder or myositis.

As believed by some in the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Wilson et al., 1999), the accumulation of intracellular A␤ (A␤ i ) in muscle fibers may be an initiating event in IBM (Askanas and Engel, 1998;Sarkozi et al., 1993;Yang et al., 1998). Alternatively, A␤ i deposition may be an epiphenomenon unrelated to myofiber death (Pruitt et al., 1996). While programmed cell death (apoptosis) appears to be partly responsible for neuronal loss in AD (Cotman, 1998), there is scant and conflicting evidence as to whether myocellular death in IBM involves apoptosis (Behrens et al., 1997;Figarella-Branger et al., 1998;Fyhr and Oldfors, 1998;Olive and Ferrer, 1999). With regard to AD brain, alterations in the expression of apoptosis regulatory genes, Bcl-2 and Bax, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) labeling of neuronal nuclei have been reported (Sawa et al., 1997;Smale et al., 1995;Stadelmann et al., 1998;Su et al., 1997). Nuclear DNA cleavage has been observed in A␤-containing neurons in AD brain and in transgenic mice expressing intraneuronal murine A␤ i (Laferla et al., 1995(Laferla et al., , 1997)). Apoptosis is correlated with A␤ i accumulation in degenerating hippocampal neurons of rats injected with adenovirus-encoded wild-type ␤-amyloid precursor protein (␤APP 695 ) (Nishimura et al., 1998) as well as noted in cultured cortical neurons infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-␤APP 695 (Bursztajn et al., 1998). Induction of apoptosis in cultured neurons by application of A␤ has also been described (Forloni et al., 1993;Li et al., 1996;Loo et al., 1993). Cleavage products of ␤APP metabolism, including the 42 amino acid fragment A␤ 42 and the larger precursor fragment C99, have FIG. 1A. dUTP-fluorescein end-labeling of DNA breaks in A␤-laden IBM myofibers.

both been shown to induce neuronal death and there is controversy as to the true identity of the toxic peptide.

C99 (or C100) is the ␤-secretase cleavage product of ␤APP, contains the full A␤ sequence, has intrinsic fibrillogenic properties and may also have a neurotoxic role in AD (Neve and Robakis, 1998). Mouse brains expressing transgene ␤APP C100 readily demonstrate neuronal and synaptic losses (Berger-Sweeney et al., 1999;Nalbantoglu et al., 1997;Oster-Granite et al., 1996). Differentiating PC12 cells that expressed C100, but not A␤ 42 , have been shown to undergo cell death (Kim and Suh, 1996;Sopher et al., 1994;Yankner et al., 1989). Furthermore, neurons infected with viruses expressing familial AD-causing ␤APP mutants predominantly ac- cumulate C100 in the cell compared to neurons infected with viruses expressing wild type ␤APP or mock infected (McPhie et al., 1997). Nevertheless, C100 is metabolized to A␤ (Dyrks et al., 1993;Maruyama et al., 1990;Wolf et al., 1990) and apoptosis in neuronal cells expressing the ␤APP V642I mutation (Zhao et al., 1997;Giambarella et al., 1997;Yamatsuji et al., 1996) could be related to C100 expression, concurrent changes in A␤ i levels or both.

A direct connection between AD and IBM was made in concurrent reports showing vacuolated myopathy and ␤-amyloid inclusions in skeletal muscle of two different transgenic mice overexpressing C99 (Fukuchi et al., 1998;Jin et al., 1998). In the Fukuchi et al. study, both wild-type, intact C99 transgene and the A␤ byproduct were detected in muscle deposits. In the Jin et al. study, a mutation was introduced into the C99 transgene product to presumably limit intra-amyloid cleavage. Myofiber deposits were immunoreactive using a single antibody which possibly recognizes either A␤ or C99. Therefore, it remains unclear from these studies which species is more involved with the vacuolization process in muscle.

In this report, we address whether A␤ may contribute to myofiber loss in patients with IBM. We also compared in a uniform muscle cell system, the toxic prop-erties of C99 and A␤, in order to build on the questions raised by the two C99-transgenic studies (Fukuchi et al., 1998;Jin et al., 1998). First it is demonstrated that myofiber DNA fragmentation correlates with intracellular A␤ deposits in IBM muscle specimens. Next, we show that ectopic A␤ 42 expression, but not the larger C100 fragment or ␤APP, provokes fibrillar inclusions and can cause efficient apoptosis in differentiated myotubes prepared from the murine C2C12 cell line. Finally, we use herpes simplex-1 vector mediated gene transfer of the ␤-amyloid-42 sequence in vivo, to show directly that A␤ overexpression in murine adult skeletal muscle may induce DNA breaks and apoptosis in native myofibers. These data provide the first evidence that intracellular A␤ is sufficient to induce apoptosis in skeletal muscle, suggesting it could play a contributory role in promoting myofiber loss in IBM patients.

RESULTS

Myofiber Apoptosis in Patients with IBM Correlates with A␤ Expression

Inflammatory cell collections of Ն10 mononuclear CLA-positive cells in any location.

c Immunodetection using R1282 and SMI-31 (n ϭ 1 section per patient).

mens of human skeletal muscle were immunostained to detect myofibers that were positive for A␤ expression and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick 3Ј-OH end labeling). Specimens were from quadriceps muscle of patients clinically, electrophysiologically, and pathologically diagnosed IBM (n ϭ 4) and, for comparison, matched polymyositis (PM) cases (n ϭ 4). Age-matched normal human quadriceps biopsy specimens were simultaneously processed. In order to test the null hypothesis that no correlation exists between the occurrence of apoptosis markers and presence of A␤ deposits in either sample of IBM or PM patients, we counted the numbers of A␤-expressing myofibers with or without TUNEL reactivity and nuclear condensation and of TUNEL-positive myofibers without A␤-immunoreactivity in muscle cross-sections (number per cm 2 , see Table 1). There were no significant differences in mean age, strength testing, or number of CD45-positive inflammatory cell collections between the IBM and PM groups (columns 1, 4, 8, 9). A␤-immunoreactive myofibers were almost exclusively seen in the IBM cases (columns 5 and 6). TUNEL-positive nuclei were largely confined to A␤bearing myofibers (column 5). Importantly, TUNELpositive intramyofibrillar nuclei were extremely rare in A␤-negative IBM and PM case fibers (column 7). A␤bearing IBM myofibers also containing TUNEL-positive nuclei were approximately half as many in number as A␤-bearing myofibers that did not (columns 5 and 6).

The association of TUNEL-positivity with A␤-immunoreactivity was statistically significant in the IBM group ( 2 calc ϭ 27.3, 2 1, 0.05 ϭ 3.8, P Ͻ 0.005) in spite of the general rarity of both events (there are ϳ2 ϫ 10 4 transverse myofiber profiles per cm 2 cross-section). There was no association between inflammatory cell collections and A␤-bearing myofibers in IBM (columns 8 and 10), in agreement with published results (Barohn et al., 1995). In these IBM samples, A␤-bearing fibers were usually also positive for phosphorylated neurofilament proteins (columns 11 and 12), as noted by others (Askanas et al., 1996).

Representative serial sections from two cases within each of these IBM and PM sample populations were simultaneously stained for TdT-mediated dUTP-fluorescein incorporation and A␤ immunoreactivity (using mAb 21F12) and then examined by epifluorescence microscopy in Figs. 1A and 1B, respectively. TUNEL reactive nuclei were exclusively seen in A␤-bearing IBM myofibers and were further restricted to those fibers bearing large burdens of A␤ immunoreactivity. The PM (and normal control) cases revealed virtually no or extremely rare instances of either A␤ deposits or apoptotic myofibrillar nuclei. Several different patterns of fluorescein-dUTP-labeled nuclei were detected in IBM patients (Fig. 1A). Pattern 1 consisted of condensed and fragmented subsarcolemmal nuclei (row A). Pattern 2 was composed of subsarcolemmal and either centralized or invasive TUNEL-stained nuclei (row B). In pattern 3, a focal interstitial (endomysial) collection of TUNEL nuclei is observed (row C). In pattern 4, myofibers contained TUNEL nuclei flattened against the external sarcolemma in the endomysium, as well as internal to the myofiber (row D). The abundant sarcoplasmic A␤ 42 -immunoreactive deposits, which occupy the myofibers bearing TUNEL nuclei, did not colocalize with the condensed, Hoechst-staining nuclei. In Fig. 2B, occasional extrafusal TUNEL-reactive nuclei were observed corresponding to cellular infiltrates in the interstitium surrounding abnormal PM myofibers (rows B and D, arrows).

A␤ Accumulation Is Sufficient for Myotube Apoptosis in Vitro

The association of intrafusal TUNEL-positive nuclei with A␤ accumulation in IBM is only correlative evidence. To further investigate the relationship between intracellular A␤ accumulation and myotube apoptosis, we utilized a cultured myotube system in which we could direct the over-expression of A␤ 42 and its precursors C100 and holo-␤APP. This was achieved using herpes simplex viral-mediated gene transfer (Figs. 2A  and 2B). Murine C2C12 myoblasts terminally differentiate into postmitotic, multinucleated myotubes that exhibit a low level of apoptosis relative to differentiating myoblasts (Wang and Walsh, 1996). Replication-defective HSV-1 vectors transduce cultured myotubes with high efficiency relative to myoblasts (Huard et al., 1995(Huard et al., , 1997) ) (and H.Q., data not shown), a feature that permitted analysis of myofiber toxicity in the absence of confounding effects on differentiating myoblasts. HSV-1mediated ␤-galactosidase expression at 24 h postinfection in day 5 mature myotubes, revealed maximal expression occurred at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) ϭ 1.25, corresponding to a myotube infection efficiency of 90% (Fig. 2C). Little or no cytotoxicity was observed in parallel cultures using measurements of trypan blue exclusion from cells. Transgene expression in myotubes infected with the other HSV-vectors were comparably efficient (see below).

Expression of C100 and A␤ from cognate HSV-1 vectors was assessed in C2C12 myotube cultures by immunoprecipitation (IP) of radiolabeled lysates and medium (Fig. 2D). In myotube cultures infected with HSV-C100, but not HSV-␤gal, the ϳ14.5-kDa product was recog-nized in cell lysates by ␣C8 and R1736 antibodies (lanes 2 and 3). No 14.5-kDa signal was detected when rabbit serum replaced the primary antibody (lane 1 in Fig. 2D). As expected, the 10-kDa ␣-secretase product of C100 metabolism was recognized only by ␣C8 (lane 2, Fig. 2D). Analysis of the media from HSV-A␤, C100, and ␤-gal-infected cultures using monoclonal antibody 21F12 showed increased release of soluble A␤ 42 in the HSV-A␤ 42 -infected cultures (lane 9) and to lesser extent by HSV-C100 infected myotubes (lane 8). The latter result is consistent with a precursor-product relationship catalyzed by ␥-secretase (see Fig. 2A). Faint detection of endogenous murine A␤ in lane 7 is consistent with complete homology between human and mouse  lanes 1-3, 8), HSV-␤gal (lanes 4 -6, 7), or HSV-A␤ (lane 9) particles. At 12 h, cells were metabolically labeled with [ 35 S]methionine for an additional 12 h before harvest of lysates in lanes 1-6 and collection of media in lanes 7-9. IP of cellular C100 using antibodies ␣C8, R1736, or control rabbit serum along top of lanes 1-6. IP of soluble A␤ species from media using mAb 21F12 and protein G agarose in lanes 7-9. 10 -20% Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gel and autoradiography.

(C) CЈ-terminal amino acids of the A␤ epitope and large induction of ␤APP biosynthesis in mature C2C12 myotubes (unpublished results). Small quantities of the A␤ 42 peptide were also detected in lysates of HSV-A␤ treated but not HSV-␤gal, HSV-C100, or HSV-wt␤APP 751 -infected myotubes by IP-Western blot analysis using R1282 and monoclonal antibody 266 (vs aa 13-28 of the A␤ sequence) (result not shown). Relative expression levels of the specific proteins were simultaneously compared by semiquantitative analysis of immunofluorescence intensity. Transgene-encoded protein expression was found to differ between the different HSV vectors by only two-to fourfold, favoring the higher levels in full length ␤-gal and ␤APP-bearing HSV transductions (results not shown).

Evidence for A␤ 42 -induced apoptosis in myotubes was obtained by TUNEL analysis. A representative photomicrograph demonstrating coexpression of A␤ 42 and nuclear dUTP end-labeling is shown in Fig. 3A. Omission of TdT and primary antibodies produced dark fields in control wells (not shown). A␤ 42 -expressing myotubes also displayed other characteristics of apoptosis including nuclear conden-sation following staining with bis-benzamide and membrane rounding when examined by phase contrast microscopy (top row, Fig. 3A). In contrast, myotubes in these cultures that were negative for A␤ 42 expression were also negative for markers of apoptosis. Myotubes expressing C100 or ␤-galactosidase were several-fold less likely to show TUNEL staining, chromatin condensation and membrane rounding. Representative negative cells are given in the middle and bottom rows of Fig. 3A. However, there was noticeable thinning of individual C100-expressing myotubes as shown in the middle row. The cellular immunodecoration of A␤ expression using mAb 21F12 in a representative myotube infected 18 h earlier with HSV-A␤ 42 is shown in Fig. 3B. The cytoplasmic vesicular pattern also remained similar at later time points when markers of apoptosis became apparent, as in Fig. 3A, top row. C100-expressing myotubes showed an identical pattern. Furthermore, this expression pattern was identical with HSV vectors that express A␤ or C100 fused to a signal peptide (HSV-SP-A␤ and HSV-SP-C100, respectively) (results not shown), suggesting that there are no major differences in the subcellular compartmentalization of these small peptides attributable to the presence or absence of an endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence.

The relative number of myotubes expressing viral encoded protein and positive for Ͼ2 TUNEL nuclei is shown in Fig. 3C. Nonexpressing myotubes in the same wells were also scored and used as control. The frequency of apoptosis in myotubes expressing A␤ 42 was 12.6 fold greater than in the control population of nonexpressing myotubes (P Ͻ 0.05, two-tailed student's t test). Myotubes expressing ␤-galactosidase were only 2.6 as likely as control to contain TdT-labeled nuclei (not statistically significant). There was also a trend for increased DNA end-labeling in C100-transduced myotubes (5.4-fold increase compared with control), which too was not significant. Transduction efficiency (expressing Ϭ total myotubes) were comparable at ϳ70% in all infections (Fig. 3C). The number of myotubes in a well exposed to an HSV-vector and containing Ͼ2 condensed nuclei was also scored using bis-benzamide staining and immunofluorescence microscopy. In a survey of 10 random high power microscopic fields, the HSV-C100 and HSV-LacZ-treated wells had only 4.5 Ϯ 0.7 and 4.5 Ϯ 3.5 myofibers containing condensed nuclei, respectively. However, in HSV-A␤-treated wells, 18.5 Ϯ 2.1 myotubes had condensed intramyofiber nuclei (P Ͻ 0.05, n ϭ 4 experiments), in good agreement with the TUNEL data.

Double stranded DNA fragmentation into multimers of ϳ180-bp nucleosomal units is characteristic of Ca 2ϩ / Mg 2ϩ -dependent endonucleases which become activated during programmed cell death (Walker et al., 1994). In Fig. 3D we show evidence of DNA ladders in HSV-A␤ 42 -infected myotubes, but not in uninfected, HSV-␤gal or -␤APP-infected cells. A faint ladder is detected in HSV-C100-infected cells, consistent with the TUNEL results in Fig. 3C.

As further evidence that A␤ is a specific effector of apoptotic death in myotubes, MTT assays were performed to analyze mitochondrial function in C2C12 myotubes transduced with the various HSV cDNAs Quantitation of apoptosis in C2C12 myotubes expressing A␤42 and C100 peptides. Cultured cells were treated for 24 h with HSV-cDNA particles as indicated on the horizontal axis. Apoptosis was scored as the number of TUNEL-positive and expressing myotubes relative to TUNELstaining but nonexpressing myotubes within the same sample (control ϭ 1.0). m.o.i. ϭ 1.25. * P ϭ 0.02, two tailed student's t test vs ␤-galactosidase. Transduction efficiencies were comparable (bottom). (D) Oligonucleosomal banding in A␤-expressing C2C12 myotubes. Evidence for DNA laddering in HSV-A␤ 1-42 -infected cells is shown in lane 3. A faint ladder is observed in HSV-C100 treated myotubes (lane 4). Myotubes were 4 days in low serum containing media before addition of HSV particles encoding proteins listed in lanes 2-5 and harvested at 48 h. The positive control in lane 6 is U937 cells treated with 4 g/ml camptothecin. 2 g DNA was loaded. M, 1-kb molecular marker.

(Fig. 4). Similar to A␤-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells (Guo et al., 1997;Shearman et al., 1994), the HSV-A␤ infected myotubes displayed a significant 25% decline in the capacity to reduce MTT at 24 h, that became more pronounced at 48 h postinfection (40% decline; Fig. 4A). In agreement with previous experiments, HSV-C100transduced cells showed a smaller (15%) decline in viability at the 48 h time point. These results were corroborated in separate experiments using only HSV vectors encoding signal peptide sequence-containing transgenes (Fig. 4B). Myotube cell counts were also performed at 40 h after infection with the HSV vectors. Significant declines in cell number occurred in both A␤ and C100-transduced cultures (Fig. 4C, P Ͻ 0.005). Cell loss in LacZ or ␤APP-transduced myotubes was negligible.

A␤-and C100-induced cytotoxicity was also assessed by fluorescein-labeled Annexin-V labeling at 18 h postinfection. Significant decoration of cell surface was observed in many of the A␤-expressing myotubes (Fig. 5), but was absent in cultures infected with the other viral constructs. Samples were also exposed to propidium iodide (PI), a DNA-binding, vital stain, which is taken up by the nucleus of dying cells with leaky plasma membranes. A fraction of the Annexin-V-positive myotubes in the HSV-A␤-infected wells were also positive for PI staining. When HSV-SP-A␤ and HSV-SP-C100 vectors were tested against their counterparts without the signal peptide sequence, the same results were obtained.

Finally, ultrastructural confirmation was obtained in Fig. 6, which shows that intramyotubular A␤ 42 expression produces cytotoxic features common to IBM cases and that the A␤ transgene product accumulates in a fibrillar state consistent with its greater neurotoxic role. In electron micrographs taken from myotube cultures exposed 48 h earlier to HSV-A␤ 42 (with signal sequence), we found well-defined cytoplasmic inclusions (frame A), mitochondrial paracrystalline structures (frame B) and both amorphous deposits and 6 -10 nM filaments within the inclusions (frame C). The fibrils were either scattered or loosely arrayed into bundles. All these changes are reported in sIBM fibers (Askanas and Engel, 1995). HSV-A␤ 42 transduction without signal sequence also induced inclusions but fewer fibrils relative to the HSV-SPA␤ 42 vector. Thirty-eight-hour cultures using either construct were also less affected (results not shown). Fewer paracrystalline deposits in mitochondria and non-fibril containing inclusions were seen in the C100 transductions. Mock and HSV-LacZ experiments were devoid of these changes.

A␤ Accumulation Is Sufficient to Induce Myofiber Apoptosis in Mouse Gastrocnemius Muscle

To test whether intracellular A␤ 42 could induce apoptosis in normal young adult mouse muscle, gastrocnemius muscles of 5 week C57BL/6J mice were injected with HSV-A␤, -C100, -␤APP 751 , or -LacZ particles in normal saline or with vehicle alone and myonuclear DNA strand breakage events were assayed using TUNEL. At 48 h postinjection, intramyofibrillar, TUNEL-positive nuclei were noticeably more abundant in A␤ 42 -expressing myofibers. An example of myofiber nuclei incorporating digoxigenin-dUTP identified using anti-dig-rhodamine (ApopTag, Intergen) are shown in row A of Fig. 7 (arrows). These nuclei belong to the two A␤ 42 -expressing myofibers (row A, columns 2 and 4). In a total of 207 A␤-expressing myofibers identified within the three injection fields, DNA end-labeling and condensation were identified in 114 intramyofibrillar nuclei (a TUNEL nuclei/A␤ transgene-myofiber index of 0.55). Furthermore, 15.4 Ϯ 6% of A␤(ϩ) myofibers had Ն2 positive nuclei each while such myofibers were rarely observed in the other injections. C100-and LacZcontaining myofibers typically revealed little or no evidence of TUNEL-positive nuclei (Fig. 7, rows B and C). HSV-␤APP and saline injections were also negative (results not shown). Indices for TUNEL nuclei/transgenepositive myofibers were 0.14, 0.07, and 0.04 for C100, ␤APP and LacZ, respectively (P Ͻ 0.05 vs A␤ 42 ). Omis- sion of TdT and primary antibody resulted in dark fields and use of irrelevant antibody (e.g., 5A3/1G7, ␣C8, or anti ␤-gal at the A␤ 42 injection site) were also negative. As positive control, a saline-injected muscle section was exposed to DNAse-1 before development, resulting in numerous TUNEL-positive nuclei (row D). At all viral injection sites, there was variable evidence of fiber death and leukocytic infiltration of the perimysium, by phase contrast microscopic analysis. Occasionally, a few cells in the endo-and perimysium were also TUNEL-positive (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

IBM shares many cytochemical and pathologic hallmarks with AD, including degeneration, shrinkage and death of postmitotic cells (myofibers), abnormal phosphorylated paired helical-like filamentous inclusions, and A␤ deposits notable for their cellular location. However, there has been no reported association between the prevalence of markers of apoptosis and A␤ deposition in IBM myofibers or documentation of a pathobiologic relationship between A␤ expression and apoptotic death in cultured myotubes. We first demonstrate that apoptotic DNA fragmentation statistically coincides with A␤ expression in vacuolated IBM myofibers. However this is correlative data and due to the rarity of such events, a stronger relationship is not FIG. 5. Annexin V binding to C2C12 cultures treated with HSV-constructs. Transgene cDNAs are indicated on the left. Cells were exposed to Annexin-V fluorescein (diluted 50ϫ) and propidium iodide (PI; 1 g/ml) after 18 h and evaluated by fluorescence microscopy shortly thereafter (see methods).

proven. Therefore, we examined the causal hypothesis, that A␤ may be at least one of several toxic stimuli which provoke cellular death in IBM, in greater depth using cultured myotubes and gene transfer through direct injection. Here, we show that A␤ expression is sufficient to induce myofiber apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo.

Others have noted that either: (1) ϳ0.1% of mononuclear inflammatory cells are TUNEL-positive in IBM (and PM) and that no myofibers evidenced dUTP-labeling (Behrens et al., 1997;Olive and Ferrer, 1999;Schneider et al., 1996) or ( 2) that means of ϳ50 nuclei of inflammatory cell origin and ϳ7 myonuclei per 10 4 myofibers were TUNEL-positive in IBM (Hutchinson, 1998). In the latter study, there was no correlation with congophilic amyloid deposits. We counted a comparable mean of ϳ8 myofibers per ϳ2 ϫ 10 4 myofibers that harbored multiple DNA end-labeled nuclei. However, in our series the majority of these were also laden with A␤-immunoreactivity. The difference could be explained by a greater sensitivity of immunologic over congo red methods in detecting A␤ deposits. Furthermore, DNA fragmentation was not noted in a larger pool of unequivocal, but less robust, A␤-bearing fibers in the IBM specimens. These results suggest that cytotoxicity is triggered in myofibers once a threshold accumulation of A␤ is achieved. The low frequency of in vivo DNA fragmentation events in IBM is possibly consistent with the notion that the accumulative effects of apoptosis could be a contributor to myofiber loss and accompanying weakness in IBM. Similarly, low levels of chronic apoptotic cell death (0.25-3% prevalence) may contribute to organ failure in liver (Bursch et al., 1990), heart (Olivetti et al., 1997), and possibly in AD brain (Cotman, 1998;Perry et al., 1998).

The patterns of TUNEL staining also deserve comment. Most commonly we observed patterns 1 and 2 and absence of adjacent inflammatory cells, consistent with myonuclear apoptosis in A␤-bearing muscle cells. Pattern 3, in which dUTP-labeled nuclei were found in the endomysium and not inside the adjacent A␤-bearing myofibers, may represent a rare collection of leukocytes undergoing ligand-mediated apoptosis in proxim-

Yet, we noted no correlation between CD45-positive infiltrates and A␤positive fibers in our Table . In pattern 4, which also includes myonuclear dUTP-labeling, we speculate that endomysial myoblastic or satellite cells might be affected in a DNA cleavage or repair process.

Transfer of the A␤ 42 peptide and its precursor proteins, C100 and ␤APP, into terminally differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells or mouse gastrocnemius muscle was achieved with replication-defective Herpes virus vectors. In cell culture experiments at m.o.i. of 1 or in direct injections of mouse skeletal muscle with Յ3 ϫ 10 6 particles, efficient ␤-galactosidase marker gene expression was observed with little or no cytopathic activity. Our ability to avoid general HSV-1 cytotoxicity using these constraints is similar to the published experience of others (Huard et al., 1995(Huard et al., , 1997)). In cultured myotubes, A␤ 42 -induced apoptosis was demonstrated by the presence of: (1) double-stranded DNA oligonucleosomes characteristic of endonuclease mediated DNA fragmentation, (2) DNA breaks detected by TUNEL, (3) nuclear condensation of DNA, (4) early appearance of membrane phosphatidyl-serine externalization, (5) loss of myotube number, and (6) decreased cellular redox activity. Apoptosis was specific to A␤ 42 peptide expression because HSV-directed expression of A␤ sequence-containing precursors; C100, SP-C100, and ␤APP, essentially produced control levels of apoptosis markers. Our model is also supported by ultrastructural changes consisting of inclusion body formation, mitochondrial abnormalities and fibrillization specific to A␤ 42 expression. Finally, we documented that herpes virus-mediated A␤ 42 expression in mouse skeletal muscle was sufficient to induce myofiber apoptosis in vivo. In this model, A␤ 42 -induced myotoxicity was identified by nuclear condensation and TUNEL assay of DNA breaks.

C99, a precursor to A␤, may also carry pathological significance in IBM. For instance, it could influence the accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein, since CЈterminal ␤APP epitopes are present in IBM inclusions (Askanas et al., 1993) and it has a tau-paired helical filament binding site not present in A␤ (Giaccone et al., 1996). We also found that the C100 peptide was toxic to myofibers, but it was a much weaker stimulus for apoptosis than intracellular A␤ 42 . It is possible that cell damage from C100 expression indirectly resulted from the release of A␤ into the medium. However, one study has shown that soluble A␤ has no cytotoxic effect when added to C2C12 cells (Baron et al., 2000). We also tested both C100 and A␤ constructs with endoplasmic reticulum-targeting signal peptide sequences, since A␤ 42 is produced in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and intermediate compartments (Cook et al., 1997;Wild-Bode et al., 1997) and the intracellular receptors and caspases, which mediate A␤ 42 -induced cytotoxicity are ER resident proteins (Nakagawa et al., 2000;Yan et al., 1997). No obvious differences were found in either the subcellular locations of the SP-A␤ or SP-C100 transgene products or in the cytotoxicity of these constructs compared to the respective transgenes lacking signal sequences. The reasons for this are unclear. Perhaps it could relate to the relative under-utilization of signal peptide sequences in directing very small peptides. In FIG. 6. Ultrastructural changes in A␤ 42 -expressing myotubes. C2C12 myotubes were exposed to HSV-A␤ 42 , -SPA␤ 42 , -C100, SPC100, and -LacZ cDNAs or mock infected, 48 h earlier and fixed/embedded for electron microscopy. Myotubes expressing SPA␤ 42 (with signal peptide sequence) contained sarcoplasmic inclusions in frame A. (4,000ϫ; bar, 2 M) and dark intramitochondrial paracrystalline inclusions in frame B. (40,000ϫ; bar, 200 nM). High-power images of sarcoplasmic inclusions reveal 6 -10 nM fibrillar material and amorphic deposits in frame C (40,000ϫ; bar, 200 nM).

higher eukaryotes, small precursor proteins can translocate posttranslationally without requiring the signal recognition machinery (Zheng and Gierasch, 1996). We have also presented data in neurons which show that the subcellular localization of the expressed C100 fragment (without signal sequence) is very similar to that of the ␤-secretase products from full-length ␤APPs bearing FAD mutations and the signal peptide sequence (McPhie et al., 1997). A␤ production also follows from the expression of C100 devoid of SP (McPhie et al., 1997), as shown here in Fig. 2. A recent comparison of subcellular fractions and apoptotic activity in neurons using C100 with and without signal peptide sequences gave equal results (D. McPhie and R. Neve, submitted).

Our main goal was to show that intracellular A␤ 42 is sufficient for myofiber death. We do not claim that viral-mediated A␤ 42 gene transfer into muscle cells fully produces all characteristics of IBM. Nor does the time course of accelerated A␤ production resemble that of IBM. Some typical changes such as scattered inflammatory infiltrates, angulated myofibers with vacuoles and deposition of cytoplasmic/nuclear tubulofilaments are not addressed in our experiments. The viral delivery approach results in a very high transgene copy number and in the rapid, direct expression of the end product, i.e., A␤. We believe this explains the high incidence of DNA breaks and nuclear fragmentation we observe in these relatively young animals when injected with HSV-A␤ 42 (Fig. 7), whereas progressively fewer such changes were seen in C100 and ␤APP gene transfer injections. We hypothesize that transgenic mice with a lower copy number of a precursor molecule to A␤, take longer time to process and accumulate A␤, hence lesions were only produced in 18-to 24-month animals in those studies. These C99-transgenic models for IBM either did not document filament formation and saw only rare evidence for thioflavin-S or congophilic staining (Fukuchi et al., 1998) or reported very small arrangements of short fibrils (unlike the compacted deposits in IBM (Askanas et al., 1993)) and an absence of either tubulofilaments or nuclear inclusions (Jin et al., 1998).

Increasingly, apoptosis is recognized as an early contributor to cell death in disorders of skeletal muscle such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Tidball et al., 1995) and chronic denervation as in ALS (Tews et al., 1997). The results of our study suggest that IBM can be viewed as a model for the deleterious effects of intracellular accumulations of abnormally folded proteins on postmitotic, electrically excitable cells. They support a contributory role for intracellular A␤ in the pathogenesis of this disease, although to what extent remains to be proven. Thus, in broader terms, IBM may belong in an expanding class of degenerative disorders characterized by filamentous inclusions. The latter include cytoplasmic tau and ␣-synuclein deposition in AD/frontotemporal dementia and the Lewy Body diseases, respectively, as well as disorders caused by abnormal expansion of polyglutamine repeats resulting in nuclear accumulations of truncated huntingtin (Huntington's disease) or ataxin-3 (spinocerebellar ataxia) (Goedert et al., 1998). Filamentous inclusions comprised of these deranged proteins also result in death through apoptosis (Ikeda et al., 1996;Saudou et al., 1998;Wellington et al., 1998).

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

Cell lines and muscle tissue.

A register of 24 cases of IBM, diagnosed by accepted clinical and pathologic criteria (Griggs et al., 1995;Lotz et al., 1989), was collected at NEMC between 1993and 1997. Each case was represented by a fresh frozen skeletal muscle biopsy specimen preserved at Ϫ80°C in OCT imbedding medium. Six-micrometer cross-sections were screened histochemically for rimmed vacuoles and congophilic inclusions using Gomori trichrome and congo red stains. In addition, intracellular ␤-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated neurofilament collections were sought using immunohistochemistry and HRP development (see below). Four cases were identified that unequivocally demonstrated abundant vacuolated, atrophic fibers with extensive ␤-amyloid immunoreactive inclusions. These cases were then closely matched with four polymyositis (PM) cases by mean age, sex, graded inflammatory infiltrate, clinical severity and length of Ϫ80°C storage. Four normal frozen muscle biopsy specimens were also assessed. The myogenic C2C12 line (ATCC) was cultured on chamber slides (NUNC) in DMEM with 10% FBS. At 70% confluence, they were differentiated into myotubes by switching to medium with 2% horse serum (Andre ´s and Walsh, 1996). C57BL/6J mice (n ϭ 5 for data shown in Fig. 7) were obtained from Jackson Labs.

Viral-mediated gene transfer. C2C12 myotubes were infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors (Bursztajn et al., 1998;Lim et al., 1996;McPhie et al., 1997) expressing human A␤ 1-42 , C100, or ␤APP 751 . An HSV vector expressing the Escherichia coli ␤-galactosidase gene (␤gal/ LacZ) served as control for these experiments. The oligonucleotides used for amplifying the A␤ 1-42 coding sequences by PCR for cloning into pHSVPrpUC are: A␤ 26 (␤APP 695 nt. 1767 to 1792, sense): 5Ј-GGAGATCTCT-GAAGTGAAGATGGATG-3Ј and A␤ 36c (␤APP nt. 1914 to

FIG. 7.

Viral-mediated gene transfer to mouse skeletal muscle cells. 5-week-old mice were injected in the gastrocnemius muscle with a total of 1.0 ϫ 10 6 HSV particles encoding the A␤ 42 (row A), C100 (row B), or ␤-galactosidase (row C) peptides or with an equal volume of normal saline (sham, row D), divided along three tracts. 48 h later the muscle was prepared as described in the legend of Fig. 3A. 10-M sections were triple stained. Rows A-C: column 1, TUNEL-staining results; column 2, immunocytofluorescence using antibodies recognizing A␤ 1890, antisense, with stop codon): 5Ј-GGCTCGAGC-TACGCTATGACAACACCGCCCACCATG-3Ј. In addition, A␤ 42 and C100 constructs in pHSVPrPUC were engineered with an additional N-terminal signal peptide of ␤APP and bridging DA dipeptide: 5Ј-MLPGLALLL-LAAWTARA-D-A-3Ј. The peptide encoded by this construct has been shown to be correctly cleaved by the endoplasmic reticulum signal peptidase upon membrane insertion, to yield A␤ beginning at aspartate 1 (Lichtenthaler et al., 1999). Amplicon viral stock titers obtained on PC12 cells using limiting dilutions and immunocytofluorescence were typically ϳ8 ϫ 10 7 infectious viral units/ml; helper virus titers obtained on 2-2 cells were typically between 1 ϫ 10 5 to 1 ϫ 10 6 pfu/ml. Particles were diluted, when necessary, into 10% sucrose/PBS prior to application. Cells were infected at m.o.i. (multiplicity of infection) of 1.25 to 2.5 infectious vector units per original myoblast plated. All plates within these experiments received equal numbers of particles between the various constructs. Of note, intensities of expression by immunofluorescence differed between the various constructs at equal doses of vector and comparable percentage yields of infectivity. Thus, some experiments were duplicated using differing infectious unit doses among the vectors that were adjusted to produce equivalent intensities of protein expression. In these, the same results were obtained. Five-week C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Labs) were injected bilaterally with ϳ0.3 ϫ 10 6 infectious units in 40 l saline per each of three tracts into a gastrocnemius muscle. Following preliminary injections of HSV-LacZ, sites of ␤-gal expression were clearly localized under low power using X-gal (0.5 mg/ml in PBS containing 4 mM K 4 Fe(CN) 6 ⅐ 3H 2 O/K 3 Fe(CN) 6 and 1 mM MgCl 2 ) development. Sham saline injections served as control. Animals were sacrificed at 48 h, the dissected muscle was frozen on dry ice and imbedded in OCT medium prior to being sectioned on a cryostat. The frozen muscle block was sampled every 250 M by collecting four serial 10-M sections. The first of these was used to locate the needle tract/injection focus by screening for viral encoded myofibrillar protein expression. One or all three of the injection site levels were eventually found in all injected muscles and the saline control (low power fields not shown). The remaining adjacent sections were analyzed using double immunofluorescence technique for the colocalization of TUNEL-staining intracellular nuclei and ectopic protein expression. For A␤, C100, and LacZ injections, 10 limbs (n) were analyzed and multiple transgene-positive slides were assessed for each limb.

Expression assays. For immunoprecipitation (IP), C2C12 cells grown on 10-cm plates were labeled 14 h with 300 Ci [ 35 S]methionine (NENExpreSS). IP of me- dia (5 ml) used polyclonal antibodies R1282 (vs total A␤ species including p3) and R1736 (vs NЈ-terminal A␤ 1-17 ; Podlisny, 1991) at 1:300 dilution, followed by SDS gel electrophoresis in 10 -20% Tris-Tricine. Exposure was 4 days to 1 week at Ϫ80°C (Fig. 2D). Cell lysates were prepared in 1.5 ml (final volume) STEN lysis buffer containing 0.2% each of TX100 (v/v), NP-40 (v/v), and BSA (w/v). These were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (PAS) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm before adding 30 l PAS and antibodies ␣C8 or R1736 against C100 epitopes. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde/4% sucrose in PBS, pH 7.4, for 20 min, washed again, and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS for 2 min at 4°C. Following a wash, they are blocked in 10% goat serum/0.01% sodium azide for 1 h. A␤ 1-42 expression in HSV-treated myotubes was detected using either: (1) primary mAb 21F12 (A␤ 42 specific; Athena Neurosciences, 1:200 dilution) with secondary goat anti-mouse Ab (GAM-CY3, Jackson Laboratories, 1:250), or (2) R1282 (1:1000 dilution) with secondary goat anti-rabbit Ab (GAR-CY3). C100 expressing myotubes were detected using rabbit Ab ␣C8 (Selkoe, 1988; recognizes CЈ-terminal ␤APP fragments including C100 and the 10 kD ␣-secretase product). Polyclonal anti-␤gal Ab (5Ј-3Ј, West Chester, PA) was used at 1:1000. Antibodies R1282, R1736, 21F12, and ␣C8 were a kind gift from Dr. Dennis Selkoe (Harvard Medical School, Center for Neurologic Diseases). Leukocytic cells in human material were detected with MAb against the Leukocyte Common Antigen epitope CD45RB (Ventana, CA).

Apoptosis assays. TUNEL: Free 3Ј-OH DNA termini (single and double stranded breaks) were labeled directly with dUTP-fluorescein (deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP/fluorescein nick end labeling) (Boehringer-Mannheim). C2C12 cells were grown in four-chamber slides and at 24 h following exposure to the various HSV constructs, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, and treated with 50 l of the TdT/dNTP mixture according to instructions. Dual immunolabeling of expressed proteins was carried out as above. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (bisbenzimide, Sigma) at 1 g/ml in PBS for 10 min prior to a wet mount in PBS/glycerol/N-propyl-gallate. Fluorescence signals were detected using a Zeiss photomicroscope equipped with a 200 W Hg source and excitation (BP450-490, 546, 330 nm)/emission (520, 590, 450 nm) filters (Omega Optical, VT). Experiments were performed in duplicate and at m.o.i. of 1.25 and 2.5. For quantitation purposes, 40 myotubes were evaluated in each of the HSV-treated wells of the duplicate four chamber slides. Oligonucleosomal banding: Cellular nucleic acids were extracted from C2C12 myotubes grown on 10-cm plates which had been infected with HSV vectors for 36 h, using 6 M guanidine-HCl/10 mM urea and glass fiber fleece according to manufacturer instructions (Boehringer-Mannheim). Three milligrams DNA was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose-0.5 g/ml ethidium bromide gel. MTT reduction cleavage: Three-day-old C2C12 myotubes in 96-well plates were exposed to virus 24 and 36 h before adding 0.5 mg/ml 5]dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (Chemicon, Inc.). The 100-l reaction proceeded 2 h at 37°C before development with either isopropanol or 10% SDS in 0.04 N HCl. Absorbance of the formazan product was measured on an ELISA plate reader with wavelengths of 650 nm (reference) and 570 nm (absorbance). Annexin-V binding: 18 h after application of HSV-cDNAs to myotubes on four chamber slides, the media was replaced with 100 l of a 50ϫ dilution of Annexin-V-Fluos in 10 mM Hepes buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 1 g/ml propidium iodide (Boehringer-Mannheim). After 10 min the specimens were photographed.

Muscle tissue immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence, and TUNEL reactions for microscopy. Sixmicrometer serial sections from fresh frozen human muscle biopsy specimens were fixed in 100% acetone at 4°C for 4 min, rinsed, and then blocked in humidified large petri dishes. Sections were immunostained with polyclonal R1282 at 1:1000 or mAb SMI-31, which detects phosphorylated neurofilament (1:1000 dilution, Alpha Center, MD). Development followed using biotinylated-GAR or -GAM/HRP-streptavidin and DAB/ 0.1% H 2 O 2 (ABC-Vector Labs), respectively. For the TUNEL-reaction/A␤-expression co-localization experiments, adjacent sections from human frozen muscle samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose in PBS and permeabilized at 4°C for 2 min using 0.1% Triton X-100/0.1% sodium citrate in H 2 O for dUTP-fluorescein 3Ј OH-labeling or simply fixed 5 min in precooled acetone for immunofluorescence detection, respectively. For the in vivo mouse muscle injections, dual TUNEL and protein expression assays were carried out according to manufacturer instructions (Ap-opTagRed, Intergen). Briefly, 10-m sections were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in PBS and permeabilized in ethanol:acetic acid (2:1) for 5 min at Ϫ20°C. DNA breaks were detected indirectly using digoxigenin-dNTPs and anti-digoxigenin rhodamine. As positive control, fixed and permeabilized sections were treated with DNAse I (Boehringer-Mannheim, 2 units/ml in 30 mM Tris base, pH 7.2, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM DTT) for 10 min at room temperature.

Electron microscopy. C2C12 myotubes on collagencoated glass coverslips were infected with the various HSV-particles at an m.o.i. ϭ 1.0 and cultivated for either 38 or 48 h. Cultures were first washed in PBS and fixed 1 h at room temperature in 5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% picric acid in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and then washed twice in buffer alone and treated with 1% osmium tetroxide, 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in H 2 O for 30 min. Three washes in Maleate buffer, pH 5.15, both preceded and followed treatment in 1% uranyl acetate. Cells were dehydrated in serial ethanols and embedded in situ by inverting capsules filled with EPON/Araldite onto coverslips. Ultrathin sections were examined using a JEOL 1200EX microscope at 80 kV.
