T cell receptor b-chain repertoire in inclusion body myositis

Inclusion body myositis IBM is the most common muscle disease affecting individuals over 50 years of age. The inflammatory reaction is characterized by cell infiltrates predominated by CD8 q cytotoxic T cells. To analyze clonality of muscle infiltrating Ž . Ž . lymphocytes, we studied the complementarity determining region 3 CDR3 length distribution of the T cell receptor TCR . Muscle Ž . infiltrating lymphocytes were studied in three IBM patients and compared with peripheral blood lymphocytes PBL in two of these Ž . patients. The study was performed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR of RNA extracted from muscle tissue and PBL followed by analysis of fragment length distribution of the CDR3 region in each of 24 different Vb families. There was a restricted usage of TCR Vb gene families in muscle infiltrating T cells in all three patients. Some of the TCR Vb gene families showed oligoclonal expansions but polyclonal patterns were dominating. The CDR3 distribution of most Vb families differed between muscle infiltrating lymphocytes and PBL indicating that T cells have expanded locally or selectively accumulated in muscle.

Introduction

Ž

. Inclusion body myositis IBM is an inflammatory muscle disease affecting elderly people and is the most common muscle disease affecting individuals older than 50 Ž . years Carpenter, 1996 . Clinically IBM is characterized by insidious onset of slowly progressive proximal and Ž distal muscle weakness Lotz et al., 1989;Lindberg et al., . 1994b . The disease is in most cases refractory to immunosuppressive therapy in contrast to polymyositis and der-Ž . matomyositis Barohn et al., 1995 . The diagnostic histopathologic findings are muscle fibers with rimmed vacuoles, 15-18 nm filamentous inclusions, amyloid de-Ž posits and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrates Griggs . et al., 1995 . The muscle infiltrating inflammatory cells are predominated by CD8 q cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which invade nonnecrotic MHC class I expressing muscle fibers Ž . Arahata and Engel, 1988 . Earlier studies have shown that Ž . there is a restricted usage of T cell receptor TCR variable Ž . Ž V b families in IBM Lindberg et al., 1994a al., 1994;Fyhr et al., 1996 . Studies on a few Vb families have shown presence of oligoclonal expansions of muscle Ž infiltrating T cells O'Hanlon et al., 1994;Fyhr et al., . 1997;Bender et al., 1998 . In this investigation we have used a recently established molecular approach to analyze Ž clonality for each TCR Vb gene segment Pannetier et al., . 1993 . The length distribution of the complementarity Ž . determining region 3 CDR3 of 24 TCR Vb gene families in muscle infiltrating T cells was analyzed. In two of the three analyzed patients the muscle infiltrating lymphocytes were compared with corresponding peripheral blood lym-Ž . phocytes PBL .

. Fig. 1 . The muscle tissue specimens were obtained from the vastus lateralis of the quadriceps femoris muscle by open biopsy and were immediately frozen in a mixture of propane and propylene chilled by liquid nitrogen and kept at y708C until analyzed. Peripheral blood lymphocytes Ž . PBL from patient 1 and 2 were isolated by separation on Ž Ficoll-sodium diatrizoate sodium gradient Ficoll-Paque, . Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden .

mRNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was extracted from 20 to 60 mg muscle tissue by guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform ex-Ž traction RNAgents Total RNA Isolation System; Promega, . Ž Madison, WI and RNA from PBL was extracted Qiashredder lysat homogenis RNeasy total RNA kit; Qiagen, . Hilden, Germany according to the manufacturer. Synthesis of first strand cDNA was performed from 0.2-1 mg Ž RNA Ready To Go you-prime first-strand beads; Pharma-. cia, Uppsala, Sweden .

PCR amplification

Ž

. Polymerase chain reaction PCR analysis was performed with 25 pmol of forward and reverse primers Ž .  denaturation at 948C for 30 s, annealing of primers at 588C for 30 s and extension of primers at 728C for 30 s. The second PCR amplification was performed in the same way but with the Cb primer conjugated to a fluorescent dye Ž . 6-FAM KEBO Lab, Stockholm, Sweden .

CDR3 analysis

One microliter of the labeled PCR products was loaded Ž on a 4.8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel Amresco, Solon, . Ž Oh and run on an automated DNA sequencer Model 377 . DNA Sequencer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA in the presence of fluorescent size markers. The length and the relative intensity of the labeled PCR products was Ž determined by using Genescane Analysis software Perkin . Elmer, Foster City, CA . Since the positions of the Vb and the Cb primers were fixed, the length distribution observed in the PCR fluorescent Vb-Cb products only depended on the size of the CDR3 region, which was set Ž . according to Moss Moss and Bell, 1995 . Potential oligoclonal T cell expansions were identified by predominant peak area corresponding to more than 50% of the total Ž . signal present in the subfamily Monteiro et al., 1995 . All samples were investigated at least twice and many of the samples needed to be diluted before the analysis.

Results

To study the degree of clonality of muscle infiltrating lymphocytes in IBM the size spectrum of the CDR3 region of 24 different Vb families was determined. First, analysis of PBL from a healthy 35-year old individual was per-Ž . formed Fig. 2a . In this case the size spectrum of the CDR3 region showed an expected Gaussian-like distribution in most Vb families indicating a polyclonal popula-Ž . tion of T cells Even et al., 1995 . Then we studied Vb family gene expression in muscle tissue from three patients Ž . with IBM Fig. 2b and c . Most but not all Vb families were detected. Thus, in patient 1 TCR Vb9, 11, 12, 16 and 23 were not detected. Patient 2 showed absence of TCR Vb2, 5.2, 10, 16 and 23. In patient 3 TCR Vb19 was not detected. The size distribution of the CDR3 region varied from a polyclonal to an oligoclonal or monoclonal pattern. By defining potential oligoclonal expansions as peaks representing more than 50% of the total peak area we found such expansions in TCR Vb2,10,19,20,21 and 22 of patient 1,in TCR Vb1,7,9,11,13,15,17,18,19,21 and Ž .  24 of patient 2 and in TCR Vb9, 14, 17, 20 and 21 of patient 3. To study if the clonal expansions of T cells in muscle tissue was a localized or systemic phenomenon we compared Vb family repertoire in muscle and blood sam-Ž . ples obtained concomitantly in two patients Fig. 2b . Oligoclonal expansions of T cells in muscle tissue were usually not apparent in the corresponding Vb families of PBL, although oligoclonal expansions were apparent also in PBL of the IBM patients.

Discussion

In this study the pattern of oligoclonality in muscle infiltrating T cells of IBM patients has for the first time been investigated. The CDR3 size distribution analysis technique used in this investigation gives an overview of most known TCR Vb families and has been shown to be an efficient method in order to identify oligoclonal T cell Ž expansions in healthy and diseased human tissues Puisieux et al., 1994;Even et al., 1995;Gaudin et al., 1995;Liu et al., 1995;Pannetier et al., 1995;Puisieux et al., 1996; . Valteau et al., 1996 . We found that some muscle infiltrat-ing T cells showed an oligoclonal expansion pattern but that the polyclonal pattern dominated. In addition, we demonstrated that the TCR CDR3 length distribution of PBL investigated in parallel showed a different size spectrum compared to muscle infiltrating T cells expressing the corresponding Vb families. Oligoclonal expansions of PBL Ž is regularly found in healthy elderly individuals Hingorani . et al., 1993;Posnett et al., 1994 and may be due to both environmental and genetic factors. The oligoclonal T cell expansions specific for muscle tissue shown in this study gives further support for the concept that the inflammatory reaction in IBM is a local T cell response to antigenic stimulation. By combined immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR it was recently shown that cytotoxic CD8 q T cells that invaded muscle fibers were clonally restricted, whereas interstitial T cells were clonally diverse in three patients Ž . with IBM Bender et al., 1998 . Another study on polymyositis has also shown clonal expansion of muscle q Ž . fiber invading CD8 T cells Bender et al., 1995 . Investigation of oligoclonal populations of T cells may therefore be a method to identify pathogenic T cells that own the ability to invade muscle fibers. Although one Vb family Ž . Vb21 was shown to have an oligoclonal pattern in all three patients studied, most oligoclonally expanded T cells expressed TCR Vb families that differed between the individual IBM patients. This indicates that there is a variability within Vb families with respect to oligoclonality in different patients. In addition, restricted usage of Vb families with variation between individual IBM patients Ž has previously been demonstrated by us and others Lindberg et al., 1994a;O'Hanlon et al., 1994;Fyhr et al., . 1996 .

The method used in this study may be a potent tool to identify the most important pathogenic T cell clones in an individual with IBM. It has been shown that pathogenic T cell clones in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis Ž . EAE are preserved throughout the course of the disease although the phenotype of T cells diversifies as the disease Ž . progresses Kim et al., 1998 . Elucidating the role of muscle infiltrating T cells in the pathogenesis of IBM could lead to detection of pathogenic T cells and consequently identification of disease eliciting antigens. Such knowledge might increase the possibilities for specific therapy.
