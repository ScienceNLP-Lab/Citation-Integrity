An Italian family with autosomal recessive quadriceps-sparing inclusionbody myopathy (ARQS-IBM) linked to chromosome 9p1

We report an Italian family with autosomal recessive quadriceps-sparing inclusion-body myopathy (ARQS-IBM). The patients (two second cousins) developed a slowly progressive distal and proximal myopathy with complete sparing of the quadriceps. Muscle biopsy showed rimmed vacuoles in numerous muscle fibers, and electron microscopy documented accumulation of 15-21 nm filaments. DNA analysis established linkage to 9p1 and haplotype analysis revealed that the patients shared a recombined common haplotype. The gene locus of ARQS-IBM was initially mapped to chromosome 9p1-q1 in families of Iranian-Jewish origin and later confirmed in a few other ethnic groups. This is the first report of Italian patients with ARQS-IBM showing positive linkage to chromosome 9p1. Our data suggest that patients having distal and proximal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles and possible recessive inheritance, often classified as distal myopathies, should be thoroughly investigated according to the diagnostic criteria of h-IBM and, when positive, studied for linkage to chromosome 9p1.

Introduction

Sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) is a vacuolar myopathy pathologically characterized by rimmed vacuoles, mononuclear cell infiltrates, congophilia and typical cytoplamic and nuclear filaments 15-21 nm in diameter. It is the most commonly acquired muscle disease in patients 50 years of age and older [1]. Clinical onset is often insidious with muscle weakness and atrophy which progress slowly over several years involving both proximal and distal muscles. Characteristic features observed on clinical examination are thinning of the forearms, weakness of the finger extensors and flexors, and prominent involvement of the quadriceps. The etiopathogenesis of s-IBM is unknown and there is usually a poor response to steroids or immunosuppression [2].

Hereditary inclusion-body myopathies (h-IBM) include several syndromes with severe progressive muscular weakness and pathologic findings similar to s-IBM. These disorders are inherited either as an autosomal recessive or dominant trait, but the abnormal genes have not been identified [3]. The most common form of h-IBM is an autosomal recessive vacuolar myopathy with quadriceps sparing (ARQS-IBM) that was first described in Iranian (Persian)-Jewish families [4][5][6]. In 1996, the disease locus for ARQS-IBM was mapped to chromosome 9p1-q1 in nine Persian-Jewish families [7]. This phenotypically unique form of h-IBM is a severe, progressive muscle disease that affects mainly the legs with distal-proximal spreading, followed by upper limbs involvement; it always spares the quadriceps, even in late, severe stages of the disease.

We performed a morphologic and genetic study in two affected second cousins of an Italian family who showed clinical features suggestive of ARQS-IBM.

Patients and methods

Our two patients were second cousins belonging to a family from a small Italian village of about 3000 people. The patients were both female. No other family members in the previous generations were affected. In addition to the mothers who were first cousins, all individuals (including fathers and grandfathers) came from the same village. This suggests that the disease in this family is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait similarly to the previously described families in which linkage to 9p1 was demonstrated.

In both patients, disease onset occurred in the second or third decade with progressive weakness and atrophy of distal leg muscles, most marked in tibial and peroneal muscles. In the following years, muscle weakness spread proximally to the lower limbs involving the hip flexors and extensors. It affected the distal muscles of the upper limbs with marked weakness of the finger extensors and flexors. Ten years after onset, weakness also involved the proximal muscles of the upper limbs and neck flexors. There was no dysphagia. The disease had a slowly progressive course and, at the time of our examination, at the ages of 46 and 55 years, both patients were wheelchair bound. Severe muscle weakness and wasting was observed in the distal and proximal muscles of the the lower limbs with complete sparing of the quadriceps; there was moderate weakness of the proximal muscles of the upper limbs (biceps, triceps) while a more pronounced involvement with marked atrophy was present in the distal muscles.

Ostotendineous reflexes were weak and symmetric. Creatine kinase levels were mildly elevated (between 2 and 3 times the normal values). Electromyography (EMG) demonstrated a mixed myopathic and neurogenic pattern. A deltoid muscle biopsy had been performed in one patient. The second patient had been biopsied elsewhere ten years earlier and declined a second muscle biopsy.

We studied the muscle biopsy specimen by routine morphologic studies, congo-red staining, and immunocytochemistry with the monoclonal antibody SMI-31 against phosphorylated tau protein.

Muscle samples were also fixed and processed by standard methods and examined with a 208S Philips electron microscope.

The genetic study of our family was performed together with the 100 analysis of nine more families from different ethnic groups [8]. DNA of our Italian family was obtained from both cousins and from five unaffected family members (Fig. 1). All individuals from the different families were genotyped at the thirteen microsatellite marker loci (D9S43, D9S1485, D9S1805, D9S1817, D9S1878, D9S1791, D9S1859, D9S1804, D9S163, D9S50, D9S1874, D9S888, D9S166), spanning the ARQS-IBM region on chromosome 9p1-q1. Linkage analysis was performed using the LINKAGE package (version 4.1, CBB Research) of programs and haplotypes were determined following the order in which these markers were mapped on chromosome 9, as listed in the Genome Database at http://www.gdb.org [9].

Results

Muscle biopsy showed advanced myopathic changes such as fiber size variability, increased central nuclei and endomysial fibrosis. There were numerous muscle fibers with rimmed vacuoles containing red material on modified Gomori's stain and eosinophilic inclusions were observed in a few hypotrophic fibers (Fig. 2). Some small, angular muscle fibers were detected but there was no type grouping. Neither inflammatory changes nor mitochondrial abnormalities were present. Congo-red staining for amyloid deposits was negative. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated cytoplasmic inclusions intensely labelled with the antiphosphorylated tau protein SMI-31 antibody in vacuolated fibers (not shown). Electron microscopy showed numerous autophagic vacuoles containing myeloid bodies, membranous material and partially degraded organelles (Fig. 3). Variably sized collections of typical, 15-21 nm tubular filaments were observed near the vacuoles and under the sarcolemma (Fig. 3). The report of muscle biopsy of the second patient performed earlier described a morphologically non-specific myopathy with rimmed vacuoles. The patient had been given a diagnosis of distal myopathy.

Linkage to chromosome 9p1 in our family and in the nine other families studied was established with a maximum lod score of 11.3 at recombination fraction 0.001 between the disease and locus D9S1859 [9]. Lod scores of our Italian family are reported in Table 1. Haplotype analysis revealed that the patients shared a recombined common haplotype (Fig. 1).

Discussion

h-IBM encompass a large group of hereditary muscle diseases characterized by vacuolated muscle fibers containing typical, 15-21 nm filamentous inclusions. The inheritance can be autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked. The clinical features are heterogeneous and not diagnostic, even if muscle involvement of the distal lower limbs is often the prevalent and earliest clinical feature [2,3]. The clinical picture is, in most cases, characterized by muscle weakness and wasting of the limbs with distal and proximal distribution beginning in the second or third decade.  Muscle biopsy shows, in all cases, vacuolated muscle fibers containing cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of paired helical filaments 15-21 nm in diameter and nuclear tubulofilaments. Small, angular muscle fibers indicative of denervation and several regenerant muscle fibers are often observed but, in contrast to s-IBM, neither mononuclear cell inflammation nor congophilia are present. Vacuolated muscle fibers in both hereditary and sporadic forms of IBM show abnormal accumulation of a group of proteins (reviewed in [1][2][3]) also found in Alzheimer-disease brain, including beta-amyloid protein and hyperphosphorylated tau.

ARQS-IBM is a severe progressive muscle disease pathologically characterized by vacuolated muscle fibers containing the typical 15-21 nm tubulofilamentous inclusions. The gene locus of ARQS-IBM was initially mapped to chromosome 9p1-q1 in families of Iranian-Jewish origin and later confirmed in other ethnic groups: Afghani-Jewish, Indian, Japanese, Mexican and North-American families [3,8,10].

Progress in clinical diagnosis and genetic investigations allowed the demonstration that several muscle diseases previously designated as distal myopathies are indeed forms of h-IBM, based on muscle pathology and the newest genetic studies [3]. Interestingly, the distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles and autosomal recessive inheritance, first described by Ikeuchi and co-authors in Japanese patients, was later mapped to chromosome 9p1 and revealed to be an allelic disorder to ARQS-IBM, based on both characteristic muscle pathology and linkage to the same locus on chromosome 9p1-q1 [8].

Our family represents, to our knowledge, the first report of Italian patients with clinical and pathologic features of h-IBM showing quadriceps sparing and positive linkage to chromosome 9p1. Our data also suggest that Italian patients having quadriceps-sparing, distal and proximal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles and possible recessive inheritance, often simply classified as distal myopathies, should be thoroughly investigated according to the diagnostic criteria of h-IBM and, when positive, studied for linkage to chromosome 9p1.

Sommario Descriviamo una famiglia italiana affetta da una miopatia a corpi inclusi a trasmissione autosomica recessiva con risparmio dei quadricipiti (ARQS-IBM).

Le pazienti (due cugine di secondo grado) hanno sviluppato, nella seconda decade di vita, una miopatia lentamente progressiva a distribuzione disto-prossimale ai quattro arti con completo risparmio dei quadricipiti. La biopsia muscolare dimostrava una miopatia con vacuoli "rimmed" in numerose fibre muscolari e alla microscopia elettronica erano evidenti accumuli di filamenti di 15-21 nm di diametro. 102 L'analisi del DNA ha permesso di stabilire il linkage al cromosoma 9p1 e l'analisi degli aplotipi ha evidenziato che le due cugine condividono un aplotipo comune. Il locus genico della miopatia a corpi inclusi a trasmissione autosomica recessiva con risparmio dei quadricipiti è stato mappato inizialmente sul cromosoma 9p1-q1 in famiglie di origine ebraico-iraniana, e quindi confermato in altri gruppi etnici. Questa è la prima famiglia italiana con ARQS-IBM ad essere stata mappata sul cromosoma 9p1-q1. Il nostro studio suggerisce che pazienti precedentemente classificati nell'ambito delle miopatie distali, dovrebbero essere investigati, anche in Italia, secondo i criteri diagnostici delle miopatie a corpi inclusi ereditarie e, quando positivi, studiati per il linkage al cromosoma 9p1.
