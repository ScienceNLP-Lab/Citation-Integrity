Fourteen Newly Recognized Proteins at the Human Neuromuscular Junctions-and Their Nonjunctional Accumulation in Inclusion-Body Myositisaa

The neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the synapse between a distal axonal tip of a lower motor neuron and a muscle fiber, is a highly specialized and complicated structure. At the NMJ, the molecular composition of the muscle-fiber extracellular matrix, the plasmalemma, and the immediately postsynaptic cytoplasmic domain is distinctly different from that of the nonsynaptic regions of the same muscle fiber (reviewed in references 1-6). In general, the postsynaptic proteins may be classified as those localized to the synaptic basal lamina, the plasmalemma, or the subplasmalemmal cytoskeleton. [1][2][3][4][5][6] In virtually all species including human, the most characteristic feature of the postsynaptic plasmalemma is the high concentration of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). During the last two decades, considerable progress has been made in identifying mechanisms causing AChR clustering at the NMJ. [1][2][3][4][5][6] More than a dozen other proteins that either are present only at the postsynaptic domain of the NMJ or are highly concentrated there have been identified in various species (reviewed in reference 4). Remaining largely unknown are (a) the function of many of them, (b) how and why they are assembled at the NMJ, and (c) a possible pathologic role in NMJ disorders.

During the last several years, we have studied the molecular pathogenesis of sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) and the hereditary inclusion-body myopathies (h-IBMs) (reviewed in references 7 and 8). These diseases, formerly underdiagnosed and considered infrequent syndromes, are now identified more and more often by clinicians and pathologists. Recent interest in s-and h-IBMs has been generated by the identification of abnormal accumulation within IBM muscle fibers of the group of diverse proteins previously considered characteristic of Alzheimer-disease brain and thought not to occur in diseased human muscle. 7,8 It is particularly germane that nearly all the proteins that we have found abnormally accumulated within the IBM muscle fibers are, in normal human muscle, accumulated only at the postsynaptic domain of the NMJ (TABLE 1).

Those proteins include ␤-amyloid protein (A␤), 9 two other (C-and N-terminal) 28

epitopes of the ␤-amyloid precursor protein (␤APP), 10 ␣ 1 -antichymotrypsin (␣ 1 -ACT), 13 apolipoprotein E (ApoE), 14,15 ubiquitin, 16 and cellular prion protein (PrP). 17 Those proteins were previously considered strictly neuronal and characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prion brain diseases. The accumulation of ␤APP and prion at the postsynaptic NMJ results, at least partially, from their locally increased synthesis there, evidenced by their junctionally increased mRNAs; 18,19 these same two mRNAs are also increased, along with increased SOD1-mRNA (see below), in IBM muscle fibers exhibiting increases of their corresponding proteins.

Also abnormally accumulated within IBM muscle fibers are neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthase, 24 transforming growth factor ␤1, 25 fibroblast growth factor (FGF), 26 and interleukins 1␣, 1␤, and 6, 27 all of which are likewise accumulated at normal human NMJs. Moreover, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and its mRNA, and 43-kDa protein (rapsyn), which are known junctional proteins, are also abnormally accumulated within the IBM muscle. 28 The only protein that is abnormally accumulated in the IBM muscle, but not accumulated at the NMJ is hyperphosphorylated tau. 11,12 In this article, we describe examples of these 14 novel proteins accumulated at human NMJs. So far, their functions and the mechanisms controlling their expression at the NMJ are not known. Although an important contributory pathologic role of any of these proteins in disorders of the NMJ/neuromuscular transmission has not yet been identified, it can be contemplated in the various NMJ disorders, including myasthenia gravis.

We also present our hypothesis regarding a possible mechanism for the accumulation of these "junctional proteins" within nonjunctional regions of IBM muscle fibers.

␤-AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN (␤APP)

Background ␤APP, a product of a chromosome-21 gene (reviewed in reference 29), exists in virtually all tissues. ␤APP is a glycoprotein cell-surface component containing a large extracellular N-terminus domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminus domain. 30,31 The ␤APP gene produces at least three alternatively spliced transcripts encoding ␤APP, containing 695, 751, or 770 amino acids; the last two contain in their extracellular region an insert of a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor. [30][31][32][33][34][35] The biological functions of ␤APP are unknown, but it may play a role in mediating cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interaction, neurite growth, and maintenance of cell integrity and shape. [36][37][38][39] At central and peripheral synapses, its presynaptic localization was reported, 40 although at the human NMJ we find it concentrated postsynaptically (see below). ␤-Amyloid protein (A␤) is a 39-42-residue polypeptide that is a part of ␤APP. [29][30][31]41 A␤ is the major component of amyloid fibrils in blood vessels and senile plaques in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, Dutch hereditary cerebrovascular amyloidosis, and very advanced age (reviewed in reference 29).

NMJs

Using several well-characterized antibodies against various epitopes of ␤APP including A␤, we immunolocalized ␤APP at the NMJs of normal human muscle biopsies 42 (FIGURE 1). In all biopsies, all the NMJs identified by ␣-BT binding had very strong immunoreactivity with antibodies to all the ␤APP sequences studied (this suggests that, at normal junctions, A␤ immunoreactivity may be part of intact molecules of ␤APP). The muscle nonjunctional sarcolemma was very faintly immunoreactive with all antibodies. The C-␤APP (FIGURE 1), A␤ (FIGURE 1), and N-␤APP (not shown) immunoreactivities closely colocalized with the postsynaptic cytoplasmic ␣-BT, desmin, and dystrophin 42 (FIGURE 1).

By gold immunoelectron-microscopy (immuno-EM), ␤APP immunoreactivity was localized subjunctionally for a depth of 5-7 m, especially between junctional nuclei and the base of the junctional folds, and also throughout the folds (FIGURES 2 and 3). Most commonly, ␤APP was in amorphous patches up to 30-45 nm wide and in short filaments 5-8 nm wide. Because muscle intermediate-filament desmin is an established postsynaptic component of human NMJs 43 (FIGURE 4), we colocalized at human NMJs two ␤APP epitopes and desmin by gold immuno-EM, using 5-and 15- nm gold particles to simultaneously label ␤APP and desmin, respectively, on the same sections. Desmin was in short filaments about 10-12 nm wide and in larger amorphous patches up to 45-90 nm wide. Therefore, similarly to desmin, ␤APP appears to be an integral component of the postsynaptic cytoskeleton of human NMJs. In addition to being accumulated at the NMJ, ␤APP protein appears to be locally transcribed there as evidenced by in situ hybridization studies demonstrating increased accumulation of ␤APP-mRNA at the NMJs 18 (FIGURE 5).

FIGURE 2.

Gold immunoelectron-microscopy of ␤APP at the postsynaptic domain at human NMJs (5-nm gold particles), ×48,000. ␤APP is immunolocalized subjunctionally, between and below junctional folds on short filaments and small amorphous patches (dark round patches represent the labeling of AChE used to identify NMJs). In various animal species, shown to be transcribed at the NMJ were AChRs, acetylcholinesterase, neural cell-adhesion molecule (N-CAM) (reviewed in reference 4), and utrophin. 44 Our studies of ␤APP were the first to demonstrate transcription of a protein at human NMJs. Recently, using in situ hybridization, we have also demonstrated increased transcription at human NMJs of AChR (FIGURE 6) and prion protein (see below). The physiologic role of ␤APP at the NMJ is not understood, but speculatively ␤APP may be involved in the following: (a) maintaining stability and configuration of the postsynaptic membrane by associating with postsynaptic cytoskeletal components of the muscle fiber, for example, dystrophin and desmin; (b) maintaining adhesion between the postsynaptic and presynaptic components; (c) the interaction between the postsynaptic plasmalemma and basal lamina (and perhaps junction-FIGURE 3.

(A) ×85,000; (B) ×132,000. In A and B, ␤APP is immunolocalized mainly between the junctional folds and below the folds on short filaments 5-8 nm wide; in B, ␤APP is also immunolocalized on amorphous patches. Desmin is immunolocalized on short filaments 10-12 nm wide and amorphous patches 45-90 nm wide (B). al acetylcholinesterase); (d) inhibiting, by its Kunitz protease-inhibitor portion, excessive or unwanted serine proteases that may exist at the NMJ; (e) binding and internalization of synaptic substances (analogous to the demonstrated internalization of ␤APP/A␤ into lysosomes); or (f) signaling, during development, from muscle fiber to the approaching motor axon, a perturbation of which may occur in ␤APP-overexpressed muscle fibers (see below). The strong concentration of ␤APP at human NMJs also raises the possibility that it could have a pathogenic role in some diseases affecting NMJs, such as in some patients with myasthenia gravis.

IBMs

We have reported pathologic accumulation of A␤ 9 and two other ␤APP sequences 10 in nonjunctional regions of vacuolated muscle fibers of s-and h-IBMs.

Recently, we demonstrated that overexpression of ␤APP in normal cultured human muscle fibers interferes with proper innervation and formation of the NMJs 47    (the overexpression was achieved by direct transfer into the cultured muscle fibers of the ␤APP gene via a recombinant adenovirus vector 45,46 ).

In our human-muscle rat-spinal-cord cocultures, the innervated human muscle fibers become fully cross-striated, are continuously and rhythmically contracting, and have acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) accumulated only at the NMJs. 48,49 By contrast, ␤APP-overexpressing cocultured muscle fibers apparently were not able to become properly innervated because (a) they were not cross-striated and not contracting; (b) AChE on them was in large and diffuse patches, and only 2-3% of the fibers had normal AChR clusters; and (c) axons outgrowing from the spinal cord explants had stopped when they contacted normal-control muscle fibers, but appeared to pass over the ␤APP-overexpressing muscle fibers (as if not receiving a proper signal from those muscle fibers). Note that the impaired innervation was not due to an effect on spinal cord neurons of ␤APP fragments released to the medium because treatment of control cultures with the conditioned medium did not alter innervation 47 (McFerrin et al., to be published). Hence, this culture system provides an excellent experimental model to study the role of ␤APP and other proteins in formation and maintenance of the NMJ.

PRION PROTEIN

Background

Cellular prion protein (PrP c ) is a normal brain constituent, 33-37 kDa, containing 253-254 amino acids. It is considered the precursor of the transmissible scrapie agent, namely, the pathologic prion protein scrapie, PrP sc , produced by a configurational change induced in the PrP c by the pathologic prion molecules (reviewed in reference 20). The normal functions of PrP c are uncertain. PrP c is probably on the outer surface of the plasmalemma, 50,51 with a hypothesized role in cell-cell recognition, adhesion, or communication. 52,53 PrP sc is a 33-37-kDa isoform of PrP c that is resistant to protease-K degradation. At least part of the brain PrP sc occurs as congophilic amyloid. It is found only in brains of scrapie-infected animals and in patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and kuru. 20 PrP c and PrP sc are encoded by the same gene. The amount of corresponding mRNA is the same in normal and scrapie-infected brain, 20 suggesting that PrP sc is derived from normal PrP c . Proteinase K applied to PrP sc from scrapie-infected brain generates a 27-30-kDa digestion-resistant fragment called PrP [27][28][29][30] , whereas the PrP c of normal brain is completely digested by proteinase K. 20 Therefore, PrP [27][28][29][30] , encoded by a normal cellular gene, is considered to be the disease-characteristic fraction of scrapie brain. 20 

NMJs

We have demonstrated that, in normal human muscle fibers, both PrP and its mRNA are localized only at the NMJs. 19,54  By immuno-EM, prominent loci of PrP immunoreactivity were present subjunctionally within the muscle fiber to a depth of 5-7 m; they were especially localized at the base of the junctional folds (FIGURE 8). Intense PrP immunoreactivity was also present between the folds and attached in small clusters along the muscle-fiber side of the folds. In all those locations, PrP was on 5-8-nm filaments (FIGURE 9). Thus, PrP is a part of the postsynaptic cytoskeleton, where it may help to maintain postsynaptic-fold geometry. We suggest that PrP may have an important, albeit unknown, function in normal junctional biology.

IBMs

We have demonstrated that PrP and PrP-mRNA are accumulated in nonjunctional regions of abnormal muscle fibers of s-and h-IBM. 17,19 Increased synthesis of cellular prion had not been previously reported in any human disease. [20][21][22][23] 

UBIQUITIN

Background

Ubiquitin is a 76-amino-acid intracellular protein present in all eukaryocytes. It is thought to be responsible for targeting a selective breakdown of abnormal and shortlived normal proteins by an ATP-dependent pathway (reviewed in references 55 and  56). Ubiquitin also plays a role in basic cellular processes such as DNA repair and modification of cell-surface receptors. 55,56 Ubiquitin is accumulated in senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease, in Lewy bodies of Parkinson's disease, and on abnormal inclusions in lower motor neurons of patients having amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (reviewed in references 57-59).

NMJs

In normal human muscle, ubiquitin is localized postsynaptically at the NMJ where, by light microscopy, it closely colocalizes light-microscopically with bound ␣-BT and with desmin, 60 indicating that it is located close to the AChRs.

Ubiquitin has been shown to be covalently linked to the lymphocyte homing receptor and to the receptor for platelet-derived growth factor. 61,62 Because ubiquitination of membrane proteins appears to be highly selective, it has been proposed that a posttranslational receptor modification may play a role in signal transduction or in receptor processing. 61,63 Therefore, similar ubiquitin-related mechanisms might be important at normal NMJs.

Binding of ubiquitin to receptor proteins has been postulated to be a contributory factor to an autoimmune response against the resulting molecular complex because a  

FIGURE 9.

In this particular electron micrograph illustrating a slightly obliquely cut NMJ, PrP is strongly immunolocalized between the folds and attached in small clusters (identified by arrows) along the muscle-fiber side of the folds. The NMJ and its postsynaptic folds are identified by the dark acetylcholinesterase reaction.

high percentage of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus have autoantibodies reacting with ubiquitin. 64 What role ubiquitin may play in the normal biology or pathology of the human NMJ is not yet known. Hypothetically, it may be involved in a functional posttranslational modification of the AChR or other postsynaptic proteins, or in their intracellular degradation. In myasthenia gravis, ubiquitination of the AChR could be a facilitating factor associated with the anti-AChR antibody attack. Of interest would be to determine whether patients with myasthenia gravis have circulating antibodies against ubiquitin and whether localization of ubiquitin at the NMJs is abnormal in them. Because ubiquitin is covalently bound to proteins, affinity purification of putative AChR-ubiquitin complexes should be possible.

IBMs

We have shown that ubiquitin is abnormally accumulated in nonjunctional regions of s-and h-IBM muscle fibers in several subcellular localizations, including 6-10nm filaments and PHFs. 10,16 ␣ 1 -ANTICHYMOTRYPSIN (␣ 1 -ACT) Background ␣ 1 -Antichymotrypsin (␣ 1 -ACT), a 68-kDa glycoprotein, is a serine protease inhibitor of the serpin superfamily (reviewed in reference 65). It preferentially inhibits cathepsin G, chymotrypsin, and mast cell chymases (reviewed in reference 66). ␣ 1 -ACT is secreted from the liver into the circulation, where it provides widespread functions to control unwanted proteolysis. ␣ 1 -ACT is an acute-phase protein because its concentration in plasma greatly increases after various types of stress. 66 ␣ 1 -ACT has been colocalized with ␤-amyloid protein in senile plaques of Alzheimer-disease brain. 67,68 NMJs ␣ 1 -ACT was strongly immunolocalized at human and rat NMJs. 69 At the NMJ, ␣ 1 -ACT closely colocalized with other postsynaptic components, including ␣-BT, ␤APP, desmin, and dystrophin. 69  The function(s) of ␣ 1 -ACT at the NMJ is not known. Possibly, it plays an important role in the housekeeping of various components of the postsynaptic cytoplasm, plasmalemma, and extracellular matrix. Since cathepsin G is accumulated at the NMJ, 70 putatively ␣ 1 -ACT may, among its other functions, protect junctional proteins from cathepsin G-mediated breakdown of extracellular matrix and cellular components. 66,71,73 A proposed function of another serine protease inhibitor, nexin I (PN-I), previously localized at mouse NMJs, 72 is that it may inhibit extracellular matrix proteolysis potentially caused by plasminogen activator. 73 

IBMs

We have reported accumulations of ␣ 1 -ACT in nonjunctional regions of abnormal muscle fibers of patients with inclusion-body myositis. 13 In those abnormal muscle fibers, as in senile plaques of Alzheimer brain, ␣ 1 -ACT colocalized with the increased accumulations of ␤-amyloid protein. 13,67,68 

APOLIPOPROTEIN E (APOE) AND LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTORS

Background

ApoE is a multifunctional apolipoprotein composed of three isoforms, E2, E3, and E4, each encoded by a different allele of a single gene on chromosome 19. 74,75 FIGURE 10. Double-labeling of human NMJs with antibodies against ␣ 1 -ACT (B,D) and ␣-BT (A,C), ×1200. There is a close colocalization between ␣ 1 -ACT and ␣-BT.

Its role in lipid transport is well known. Newer studies demonstrated that ApoE plays a role in various cellular events unrelated to lipid transport, including immunoregulation, modulation of cell growth and differentiation, 80 and nerve regeneration. 76 In Alzheimer's disease (AD), increased ApoE immunoreactivity occurs in amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and the cytoplasm of abnormal neurons. 77,78 

NMJs

Our original report demonstrating that ApoE is accumulated at normal human NMJs, 79 subsequently confirmed by others, 89 has been extended to emphasize its strictly postsynaptic localization there. 15 

IBMs

Our recent studies demonstrated that ApoE is accumulated in abnormal muscle fibers in sporadic and hereditary IBM. 14,15 

Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) Receptors

LDL receptors, which are muscle receptors for ApoE, are also immunolocalized and concentrated at the postsynaptic domain of human NMJs, according to our preliminary studies (Mirabella and Askanas, unpublished). The role of ApoE at the NMJ and the significance of increased LDL receptors there require elucidation. In s-IBM, the LDL receptors were increased in the vacuolated muscle fibers (Mirabella and  Askanas, unpublished).

TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR ␤1 (TGF-␤1)

Background

TGF-␤1 is a 25-kDa secretory peptide known to be a multifunctional regulator of cellular activity. 81,82 Produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues, it is both a stimulator and inhibitor of cellular replication. TGF-␤1 modulates cell differentiation and extracellular matrix production in various cells and plays an important role in normal growth and development during embryogenesis and tissue repair after injury. It is a potent cytokine that possesses both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities, such as suppression of T and B cell proliferation, inhibition of macrophage maturation, and activation of secretion of IgG and IgM by B cells. It has also been proposed that TGF-␤1 plays a role in myogenic development in culture. 83,84 NMJs TGF-␤1 is accumulated at normal human NMJs 25  (Mirabella et al., to be published), where, by light microscopy, it colocalizes with ␣-BT, suggesting a postsynaptic location. Its role in the normal NMJ biology remains to be studied.

IBMs

We have demonstrated that TGF-␤1 is abnormally accumulated in nonjunctional regions of IBM muscle fibers 25  (Mirabella et al., to be published). Its pathogenic role is not known.

NEURONAL (n) AND INDUCIBLE (i) NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASES (NOS), AND NITROTYROSINE

Background

Three forms of human NOS-neuronal, inducible, and endothelial-have been cloned and are encoded by different genes on chromosomes 12, 17, and 7, respectively (reviewed in references 85 and 86). Nitric oxide (NO) is a short-lived reactive gas formed by NOS directly from the guanidino nitrogen of L-arginine. 85,86 NO is considered to be both an intercellular and intracellular messenger, having many diverse functions, such as playing a role in vasodilation, mediating antimicrobial toxicity of macrophages, serving as an interneuronal messenger, and possibly influencing transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. 85,86 In contrast to many human and animal tissues in which functions of the NOS and NO have been extensively studied, their role in normal and diseased human and animal skeletal muscle is just beginning to be analyzed. Excessive production of NO is postulated to play an important role in various diseases, including neurodegenerative, inflammatory, and immunological processes. 86 The mechanisms by which NO may contribute to the pathogenesis of various diseases are not well understood, but one is thought to involve its ability to react with superoxide anion to form the highly reactive, extremely toxic molecule, peroxynitrite (reviewed in reference 87).

Peroxynitrite induces nitration of tyrosines in proteins, forming the stable component, 3-nitrotyrosine (NT). 87 Presence of NT in tissues is considered indicative of NO-induced oxidative stress. 87 NO has been reported (a) to be a messenger molecule for myoblast fusion 94 and (b) to serve as a retrograde signal, generated by muscle, for activity-dependent suppression of the presynaptic component of the developing NMJ in Xenopus nerve-muscle cocultures. 95 

NMJs

We have recently demonstrated in fresh-frozen sections that both nNOS and iNOS are strongly localized at the postsynaptic, but not the presynaptic, domain of normal human and rat NMJs 96  (FIGURES 11 and 12). By immuno-EM, the postsynaptic nNOS and iNOS are localized to variously sized filamentous and membranous structures. 96 nNOS, but not iNOS, is closely colocalized with intermediate-filament desmin. 96 iNOS was present in clusters not associated with desmin. 96 The data from our studies do not agree with studies of others who reported that in various species, in fixed sections of muscle fibers, nNOS was localized exclusively at the sarcolemma, and it was either exclusively 89 or predominantly 90 present in type-II fibers. Other studies reported the following: (a) in fixed sections of frozen human and mouse muscle, nNOS is colocalized at the sarcolemma with dystrophin 91 (subsequently, in mouse skeletal muscle, the association of nNOS with the sarcolemma was postulated to be mediated by direct nNOS binding to ␣ 1 -syntrophin, a protein of the dystrophin complex containing a PDZ motif 92 ) and (b) increased immunoreactivity  of nNOS, at adult mouse NMJs, which contrary to our results was postulated to be in the presynaptic domain. 93 The functions of the increased concentrations of nNOS and iNOS at the postsynaptic domain of the NMJ and the mechanisms of their control are not known. Recently, it was reported that NO generated by nNOS selectively enhances Ca 2+ calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of postsynaptic-density proteins in rat brain. 97 iNOS ultrastructurally is not closely associated with desmin 96 and its association with other junctional proteins is not known. In other situations, iNOS is mainly transcriptionally regulated and its synthesis can be stimulated by cytokines, inflammation, and other pathologic processes (reviewed in references 85, 86, and FIGURE 12. Double-immunofluorescence of human NMJs with antibodies against iNOS (A,C), dystrophin (B), and desmin (D), ×1200. iNOS colocalizes with dystrophin and desmin, but seems to occupy a smaller area than dystrophin and desmin. 98). In a clonal cell line of mouse muscle, induction of iNOS-mRNA by cytokines has been demonstrated. 99 Because our most recent studies demonstrate increased accumulation of interleukin 1␤, 1␣, and 6 postsynaptically at human NMJs, 27 it is possible that cytokines induce transcription of iNOS (and possibly of nNOS) at the NMJ. Alternatively, because a small amount of iNOS-mRNA was recently found to be constitutively present in some human tissues, including skeletal muscle, 100 it is possible that the increased iNOS at the NMJ represents its constitutive expression there.

It is not known whether the main function of the NOSs at the NMJ is to generate NO to (a) serve as a transduction signal for normal function of the NMJ, (b) provide a retrograde signal from the postsynaptic muscle fiber to the presynaptic axonal tip, or (c) help maintain a junctional or parajunctional structural component. Close colocalization of nNOS with the muscle intermediate-filament desmin suggests an important structure-function relationship. Future studies are needed to address these and other questions regarding the function of NOSs at the NMJs of normal and diseased human muscle.

Apparently, at normal human NMJs, NO, the product of the NOSs, is not generated in toxic excess to combine with superoxide to produce a very toxic peroxynitrite because no nitrotyrosine, which would reflect abnormally nitrated proteins, was detectable there. 96 We have demonstrated by light microscopy that, at NMJs of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients, there is only an abnormally thin band of nNOS immunoreactivity corresponding to a similarly abnormally thin band of desmin immunoreactivity, 96 correlating with the flattening and disorganization typical of MG postsynaptic folds. 101 Lack of a similar decrease of iNOS at the myasthenic NMJs 96 suggests a different mechanism of iNOS induction and/or maintenance at the NMJ. Whether either NOS, or both, plays a role in the NMJ pathology in MG is of potential importance and should be studied.

IBMs

We have demonstrated that both nNOS and iNOS, as well as NT, are abnormally accumulated in nonjunctional regions of the vacuolated muscle fibers in sporadic IBM 88 and hereditary IBM. 103

SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE-1 (SOD1)

Background

Superoxide is an oxygen free-radical toxic by-product of various cellular metabolic reactions. SOD1 and other superoxide dismutases protect the cell against oxidative stress by catalyzing the dismutation of the toxic superoxide anion O 2 • -, as follows:

NMJs

SOD1 immunoreactivity was increased at human NMJs, where by light microscopy it closely colocalized with ␣-BT, indicating a postsynaptic domain. 102 Accumulation of SOD1 at normal human NMJs suggests a locally increased need to diminish superoxide anion. Superoxide in excess can combine with NO, produced by the iNOS and nNOS at the NMJ, to form the very toxic peroxynitrite, which can pathologically nitrate the tyrosine groups of proteins, the result evidenced as nitrotyrosine. However, at normal human NMJs, there appears to be adequate disposal of both superoxide and NO because nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity, which indicates pathologic nitration of proteins, was not increased there 96 (in contrast to the presence of NT in nonjunctional regions of pathologic muscle fibers in inclusion-body myositis 88 ). Therefore, "oxidative stress" evidenced by nitration of proteins 87 apparently does not take place at the normal human NMJ. The detailed molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased concentration of SOD1 at the NMJ require elucidation.

IBMs

Recently, we demonstrated that SOD1 and its mRNA are accumulated in nonjunctional regions of abnormal IBM muscle fibers 102  (Askanas et al., to be published).

HYPOTHESIS OF "JUNCTIONALIZATION" OF NONJUNCTIONAL REGIONS OF MUSCLE FIBERS IN INCLUSION-BODY MYOSITIS

On the preceding pages, we have described 14 proteins newly recognized to be accumulated at the normal human NMJ and not elsewhere in the muscle fiber. The normal phenomena of protein and mRNA accumulation at the NMJ have been termed by us as "junctionalization" (FIGURE 13). 7,8 The postsynaptic proteins characteristic of junctionalization are induced, directly or indirectly, by the contacting motor-neuron axonal tip and presumably are governed, at least partially, by enhanced expression of the corresponding genes in muscle-fiber junctional (postsynaptic) nuclei, presumably modulated through yet-undelineated transcription factors. We have proposed a "junctionalizing master gene" whose product modulates transcription of the "junctional-protein genes". In the normal innervated mature muscle fiber, those junctional-protein genes are concurrently downregulated in the nonjunctional nuclei diffusely located in the vast nonjunctional regions of the muscle fiber (FIGURE 13). It is of particular interest that all 14 of these newly described junctional proteins, and all 3 of their studied mRNAs, have been found by us to be pathologically accumulated in the nonjunctional regions of IBM muscle fibers (e.g., ␤APP, 10 prion, 17 ␣ 1 -ACT, 13 FGF, 26 TGF␤, 25 ubiquitin, 16 ApoE, 14,15 AChR, 43-kDa protein, 28 SOD1, 102 iNOS and nNOS, 88 and interleukins 1␣, 1␤, and 6 27 ). Thus, these accumulated "junctional/IBM proteins" and their corresponding increased "junctional/IBM-mRNAs" are the ones normally accumulated in the muscle fiber only at the postsynaptic region of the NMJ. We have therefore proposed the concept of "pathologic junctionalization" of extrajunctional regions of the IBM muscle fiber, causing altered gene expression of the FIGURE 13. Hypothetical "junctionalization" mechanism (ectopic expression of junctional proteins) in inclusion-body myositis. In nonjunctional nuclei of IBM, there is reactivation of genes of junctional proteins or downregulation of a gene (genes?) of junctional-protein suppression-factor (by virus?, abnormal aging?, genetic factors?, others).

"IBM-junctionalized" (previously normal nonjunctional) nuclei perhaps via the proposed junctionalizing master gene 7,8 (FIGURE 13). Hypothetically, this junctionalization could be induced, directly or indirectly, by a putative virus in s-IBM or by a mutated-gene protein in h-IBM. 7,8 radic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM), hereditary inclusion-body myopathy (h-IBM), and cultured human muscle after ␤-amyloid precursor protein (␤APP) gene transfer.

FIGURE 5 .5FIGURE 5. ␤APP-mRNA at human NMJs. (A) In situ hybridization with the 751-␤APP-cRNA probe containing the KPI motif. (B) Acetylcholinesterase reaction on an adjacent section. Both ×650. ␤APP-mRNA is strongly increased at two NMJs identified by the acetylcholinesterase reaction.

FIGURE 6 .6FIGURE 6. AChR immunoreactivity and AChR-mRNA at human NMJs. (A) PAP immunocytochemistry of AChR using a monoclonal antibody. (B) In situ hybridization with AChR-cRNA probe. Both ×1200. There is strongly concentrated AChR immunoreactivity and AChR-mRNA at the human NMJ.

FIGURE 7 illustrates postsynaptic immunolocalization of PrP. By light microscopy, the topographic pattern of PrP im-munoreactivity at the NMJs corresponded exactly to the localization of bound ␣-BT and also closely colocalized with the postsynaptically concentrated immunoreactivity of A␤, C-␤APP, desmin, ubiquitin, and dystrophin.

FIGURE 7 .7FIGURE 7. Double-labeling of human NMJs with antibodies against prion protein (PrP) and four other established junctional proteins. (A,C,E,G) PrP; (B) ␣-BT; (D) dystrophin; (F) desmin; (H) ubiquitin. (A,B,E,F,G,H) ×1200; (C,D) ×770. There is a close colocalization of PrP with the four other postsynaptic membrane components.

FIGURE 8 .8FIGURE 8. Gold immunoelectron-microscopy of PrP at human NMJs. PrP is identified by 10-nm gold particles, ×43,000. In this picture, PrP is immunolocalized subjunctionally at the base of and below the folds. The NMJ and its postsynaptic folds are identified by the dark acetylcholinesterase reaction.

FIGURE 10 illustrates close colocalization of ␣ 1 -ACT with ␣-BT at human NMJs.

FIGURE 11 .11FIGURE 11. Double-immunofluorescence of human NMJs with antibodies against nNOS (A,C), dystrophin (B), and desmin (D), ×850. There is a close colocalization of nNOS with dystrophin and desmin.
