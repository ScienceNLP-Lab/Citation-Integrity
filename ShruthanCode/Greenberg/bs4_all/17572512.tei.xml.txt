Upregulation of thrombospondin-1(TSP-1) and its binding partners, CD36 and CD47, in sporadic inclusion body myositis

The TSP1/CD36/CD47-complex is involved in T cell expansion and inflammatory responses to β-amyloid, both relevant to IBM. We report on the mRNA and protein expression of TSP1/ CD36 /CD47-complex in IBM muscles and in human myoblasts after cytokine stimulation. The TSP1/ CD36 /CD47 was upregulated in IBM. TSP1 immunolocalized to the connective tissue contiguous to inflammation and CD36/CD47 on the myofibers and CD8+ cells. Further, TNF-α upregulated the production of TSP1 and CD47 by myoblasts. The TSP-complex is another inflammatory mediator associated with chronic inflammation in IBM that may perpetuate the immune responses to local antigens in response to TNF-α.

Introduction

Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is the most common inflammatory myopathy in patients above the age of 50 years, for which no immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies have proven to be beneficial (Dalakas, 1991;Amato and Griggs, 2003;Mastaglia et al., 2003). Although the etiology of sIBM is essentially unknown, two main mechanisms have been implicated, an autoimmune and a degenerative one. The autoimmune pathogenesis is supported by the clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells that exhibit cytotoxicity towards MHC-I-expressing muscle fibers (Dalakas, 2006a;Bender et al., 1998;Amemiya et al., 2000;Muntzing et al., 2003); the strong immunogenetic association and increased frequency with other autoimmune diseases (Badrising et al., 2004;Koffman et al., 1998); and the upregulation of cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules (Murata and Dalakas, 1999;Wiendl et al., 2003;Schmidt et al., 2004). The degenerative process is based on the presence of vacuoles in muscle fibers, not invaded by T cells, and the intracellular accumulation of amyloid, β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) and other misfolded proteins (Askanas and Engel, 2003). An inter-relationship between these two processes has been proposed, but not proven (Dalakas, 1998;Dalakas, 2006b).

The thrombospondins are a family of five extracellular matrix proteins that participate in cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix communication (Lawler, 2000). The prototype molecule among them is thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), a 450-kDa homotrimer protein that exists in soluble and immobilized forms in tissues (Silverstein, 2002). TSP1, acts as a molecular facilitator at the cell surface, bringing together cytokines, growth factors, matrix components, membrane receptors and extracellular proteases (Chen et al., 2000). Furthermore, TSP1, via its multiple binding partners that include integrins (αvβ3, α4β1, α5β1 and α3β1), CD47, CD36 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), promotes several cell-and context-specific functions, especially cell proliferation, adhesion and inflammation (Lawler, 2000) (Silverstein, 2002). CD36 is expressed on endothelial cells, muscle fibers, dendritic cells, macrophages, and monocytes. It serves a role in innate immunity by recognizing foreign or altered host antigens and binds multiple ligands including TSP-1, longchain fatty acids, modified LDL, apoptotic cells and β-amyloid (Husemann et al., 2002). CD 47, also known as integrinassociated protein (IAP), is a receptor for TSP1 that modulates the activity of certain integrins and plays a role in leukocyte transmigration (Liu et al., 2001;Brown and Frazier, 2001).

TSP-1 and its binding partners CD36 and CD47 may be relevant to the pathogenesis of IBM by serving a role in the inflammatory process and the reaction to the products of degeneration. This rationale is based on the observations that these molecules mediate oligoclonal T cell expansion in chronic inflammation (Vallejo et al., 2000),are upregulated by cytokines, especially TNF-α (Narizhneva et al., 2005), and play a functional role in the inflammatory response against fibrillary β-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease (El Khoury et al., 2003). Accordingly, we studied the expression of these molecules at the protein and mRNA level in the muscle of patients with IBM, and examined their functional role in cultured myoblasts.

Materials and methods

Patients

We studied muscle biopsies from 8 IBM patients who fulfilled the typical clinical, electrophysiological and histopathological criteria of the disease (Dalakas, 1991;Dalakas, 2002). Muscle specimens from 8 patients with an established diagnosis of dermatomyositis (DM) were used as inflammatory controls. As non-inflammatory controls, we used muscle specimens from 3 patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and 5 morphologically normal or dystrophic muscles. All patients had been admitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center and studied under Institutional Review Board approved clinical protocols. All subjects had given informed consent for performing research studies on their muscle samples.

Extraction of mRNA, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR

Total RNA was extracted from 10 to 20 mg of muscle using the RNeasy Kit from Quiagen (Valencia, CA) following the supplier's instructions. The cDNA was synthesized using 0.2 μg of RNA using the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase kit from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), following the supplier's instructions. We analyzed the mRNA expression of TSP1, CD36 and CD47 in relation to GAPDH by real-time PCR. The reactions were run in duplicates or triplicates, using specific FAM-labeled Taqman primer/probe sets for TSP1 (Assay ID Hs00170236_m1), CD36 (Assay ID Hs00169627_m1), CD47 (Assay ID Hs00179953_m1) and GAPDH (Assay ID Hs99999905_m1), all purchased from Applied Biosystems (Santa Clara, CA). 0.5 μl of cDNA was used in a total reaction volume of 20 μl based on the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The real-time PCR was performed using an Opticon II thermocycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) using the following protocol: 2 min incubation at 50 °C, followed by 10 min incubation at 95 °C, followed by 47 cycles, each consisting of a 30-s incubation at 95 °C and 1 min incubation at 60 °C.

Immunohistochemistry

Frozen sections (5 μm) of muscle biopsy specimens were fixed in acetone for 10 min at minus 20 °C and air dried for 10 min. Unspecific binding was blocked by 30 min incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 3% goat serum in Tris buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.4). All primary and secondary reagents were diluted in 1% BSA in TBS. The following primary anti-human antibodies were used at various concentrations: monoclonal mouse anti-human TSP1 (clone BA18; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), at 1:80 dilution; monoclonal mouse anti-human CD36 (clone IM0765; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) at 1:500 dilution; monoclonal mouse anti-human CD47 (clone 3H1456; US Biological, Swampscott, MA) at 1:800 dilution; fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated monoclonal mouse anti-human CD36 (clone IMO766; Beckman Coulter) at 1:40 dilution; and monoclonal rat anti-human CD8 (clone MCA351; Serotec, Oxford, UK) at 1:300 dilution. Sections were incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, followed by Alexa-488-or Alexa-594conjugated secondary goat antibodies against mouse or rat IgG (all from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 1:600 dilution for 45 min at room temperature. All sections were also stained with 4′-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), embedded in Fluoromount G (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and kept at 4 °C in a dark chamber. Immunofluorescent microscopy and digital photography were performed with an inverted Axiophot microscope ( Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) using appropriate filters for green (488 nm), red (594 nm) and blue Fig. 1.

Functional studies

Human skeletal muscle-derived cell line CCL136 which is considered parental, if not identical, to TE 671 (http://www.atcc. org), and a skin fibroblast cell line were cultured in triplicates, in the presence or absence of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1; 10 ng/ml), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α; 10 ng/ml), interleukin 1β (IL-1β; 10 ng/ml) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ; 500 U/ml) for 8 hr in serum-free medium, as described (Raju and Dalakas, 2005). Extraction of mRNA, cDNA synthesis and realtime PCR were performed as described above. The levels of TSP1, CD36 and CD47 mRNA expression were measured before and after stimulation in all cultures. For immunohistochemistry, cells were grown on culture slides and treated as above. Acetone fixed slides were immunostained as described above for the expression of TSP1. For final confirmation, human skeletal muscle-derived cell line CCL136 was re-cultured in triplicates in the presence or absence of TNF-α at the concentrations of 10 and 50 ng/ml, and the TSP1 mRNA expression measured by real-time PCR.

Statistics

The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used for the analysis of relative expression of TSP1, CD36 and CD47 in our muscle biopsy samples. The paired Student's t test was used for analysis of relative expression of TSP1 and CD47 in response to stimulation in culture. All statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism V4.0 (San Diego, CA).

Results

TSP1 expression was upregulated in IBM and DM, compared with non-inflammatory controls

The mean mRNA expression of TSP1 (normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression) was 37-fold higher in the 8 IBM muscle specimens (3.5E-3 ± 2.9E-3 SD, P = 0.0002), and 35fold in DM (3.3E-3 ± 3.7E-3 SD, P = 0.0019), compared with the 8 noninflammatory controls (9.3E-5 ± 8.9E-5 SD) (Fig. 1). No significant difference was observed between the mRNA expression of TSP1 in IBM compared to DM (P = 0.8). Immunohistochemistry showed that TSP1 was markedly increased in IBM compared with non-inflammatory controls, and mostly present between the muscle fibers in areas with abundant CD8+ T cell infiltrates, as demonstrated with dual staining for anti-CD8 antibodies (Fig. 2A-D).

CD36 and CD47 expression were upregulated in IBM and DM compared with noninflammatory controls

The mean mRNA expression of CD36 was 3-fold higher in IBM muscle specimens (6.3E-2 ± 3.2E-2 SD, P = 0.0047) and 2-fold higher in DM (5.4E-2 ± 3.8E-2 SD, P = 0.0499), compared to non-inflammatory controls (2.2E-2 ± 1.7E-2 SD) (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the mean mRNA expression of CD47 was 10-fold higher in the IBM muscle (7 E-4 ± 5.4E-4 SD, P = 0.001) and 6-fold higher in the DM (4.5E-4 ± 2.7E-4 SD, P = 0.001), compared to controls (7E-5 ± 3.7E-5 SD) (Fig. 3B). No significant difference was observed between the mRNA expression of CD36 or CD47 in IBM compared to DM (both P = 0.38). Immunohistochemistry showed that both CD36 and CD47 were increased in IBM, compared with non-inflammatory controls. CD36 was mostly localized on the surface of the muscle fibers and in a few scattered inflammatory cells present in the interstitial tissue (Fig. 4A, B). In contrast, CD47 was localized on the surface of the muscle fibers and the autoinvasive CD8+ T cells, as demonstrated by dual staining using anti-CD8 antibody (Fig. 4C-E).

TNF-α upregulates the expression of TSP1 and CD47 in human skeletal muscle-derived cell line CCL136 myoblasts

Among the cytokines used for stimulation of human skeletal muscle-derived cells, only tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) resulted in more than 3.5-fold increase in the average TSP1 mRNA expression (P = 0.035; paired t test). This effect was not seen after stimulation with transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the effect was specific for muscle cells because in the human skin fibroblast cell cultures, no increase was observed in the expression of TSP1 after stimulation with any of the aforementioned cytokines (Fig. 5B). TNF-α also resulted in more than 3.5 fold increase in CD47 mRNA expression in muscle (P = 0.0007 on paired t test), but not in fibroblasts (Fig. 6A, B). There was no increase in the expression of CD36 mRNA in muscle culture, in response to the cytokines used (data not shown). To further clarify whether the dose of 10 ng/ml of TNF-α is optimal, CCL136 cells were cultured with 10 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml of TNF-α for 8 h. Although both concentrations of TNF-α increased the expression of TSP1 above control (more than 3 fold for 10 ng/ml and 2 fold for 50 ng/ml of TNF-α; both P = 0.036), the effect was slightly higher for the 10 ng/ml concentration (data not shown). The mean mRNA expression (normalized to GAPDH) of CD36 (A) was 3 fold higher in IBM (6.3E-2 ± 3.2E-2 SD, P = 0.0047), and 2 fold higher in DM specimens (5.4E-2 ± 3.8E-2 SD, P = 0.0499), compared with the non-inflammatory controls (2.2E-2 ± 1.7E-2 SD). No significant difference was observed between IBM and DM (P = 0.38). The mean mRNA expression of CD47 (B) was 10 fold higher in the IBM (7 E-4 ± 5.4E-4 SD, P = 0.001), and 6 fold higher in the DM (4.5E-4 ± 2.7E-4 SD, P = 0.001), compared with the noninflammatory controls (7E-5 ± 3.7E-5 SD). No significant difference was observed between IBM and DM (P = 0.38).

[Previous studies had also shown a bell shaped expression of TSP1 to stimulation by TNF-α, with the highest response at 10 ng/ml of TNF-α (Narizhneva et al., 2005).

Immunohistochemistry on CCL136 cells confirmed the augmentation of TSP1 expression following stimulation with TNF-α (Fig. 7A, B).

Discussion

We found a significant increase in the expression of TSP1 and its binding partners CD36 and CD47 in both IBM and DM muscle compared to noninflammatory controls. In addition, TSP1 and CD47 were produced by the muscle in vitro after stimulation with TNF-α. The study supports prior observations that TSP1, CD36 and CD47 are functional molecules involved in chronic inflammation (Vallejo et al., 2000), and is consistent with the view that the muscle may have a role in the immune response by inherently producing molecules involved in inflammation (Wiendl et al., 2005).

TSP1 is a "matricellular" protein, whose functions are achieved by binding to matrix proteins, cell surface receptors and cytokines that interact with the cell surface. When binding to CD36, CD47 or integrins, TSP1 may exert a positive effect on T cell activation and inflammation (Vallejo et al., 2000;Mansfield and Suchard, 1994;Yabkowitz et al., 1993;Li et al., 2002). TSP1 also increases the expression of matrix metalloproteinase MMP 9 and, through its interaction with CD47, upregulates the expression of cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 (Narizhneva et al., 2005;Qian et al., 1997). Because MMP 9, VCAM-I and ICAM-I are upregulated in the muscle of IBM patients, the overexpression of TSP1 may enhance the immunopathologic process and the transmigration of T cells towards the muscle fibers (Choi and Dalakas, 2000;De Bleecker and Engel, 1994;Tews and Goebel, 1995). Within the muscle, TSP1 could be derived from various sources including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, neutrophils, monocytes, T cells, and the muscle fiber itself (Mansfield and Fig. 5. (A, B) TSP1 mRNA expression in the human skeletal muscle-derived cell line CCL136 (A) and human skin fibroblast (B), after stimulation. Stimulation was performed with transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1; 10 ng/ml), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α; 10 ng/ml), interleukin 1β (IL-1β; 10 ng/ml) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ; 500 U/ml) for 8 h in serum-free medium. There was more than 3.5 fold increase in TSP1 mRNA expression in muscle culture, compared with fibroblast culture, after overnight stimulation with TNF-α (A, B). Fig. 6. (A, B) CD47 mRNA expression in human skeletal muscle-derived cell line CCL136 (A) and human skin fibroblast (B), after stimulation. Stimulation was performed with transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1; 10 ng/ml), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α; 10 ng/ml), interleukin 1β (IL-1β; 10 ng/ml) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ; 500 U/ml) for 8 h in serum-free medium. There was more than 3.5 fold increase in CD47 mRNA expression in muscle culture, compared with fibroblast culture, after overnight stimulation with TNF-α (A, B). Suchard, 1994;Li et al., 2002). The observation that the endogenous production of TSP1 by myoblasts was upregulated by TNF-α suggests that TSP1 plays a role in response to proinflammatory cytokines within the muscle microenvironment (Wiendl et al., 2005;De Bleecker et al., 1999;Tews and Goebel, 1996).

CD36, one of the binding partners of TSP1, serves a major role in innate immunity, including the production of chemoattractants and cytokines by microglia and macrophages, but also against fibrillary β-amyloid in the proinflammatory events of Alzheimer's disease (Coraci et al., 2002;Moore et al., 2002;El Khoury et al., 2003). The effect on amyloid is proposed to be mediated through a cell surface receptor complex comprised of CD36, CD47 and α6β1 integrin (Bamberger et al., 2003). The upregulation of CD36 in the muscle could therefore play a role in enhancing the production of cytokines by macrophages present in the muscle, in response to β-amyloid.

CD47, the other TSP1 binding partner found to be elevated in IBM and DM muscle, is known as an integrin-associated protein and has multiple roles in T cell functions (Brown and Frazier, 2001). CD47 is constitutively expressed on T cells, and depending on its ligands, may act as a CD28-independent costimulatory receptor on T cells (Reinhold et al., 1997;Ticchioni et al., 1997). Since co-stimulatory molecules such as CD28, CTLA4 and ICOS are upregulated in IBM and play a role in antigen presentation (Murata and Dalakas, 1999;Wiendl et al., 2003;Schmidt et al., 2004), CD47 could enhance antigen presentation to autoinvasive T cells. The endogenous production of CD47 by myoblasts after TNF-α stimulation supports a functional role of this molecule in response to proinflammatory cytokines within the muscle microenvironment, perpetuating the chronic inflammatory response. Similar mechanisms have been proposed for the chronically inflamed rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue, where T cell activation was thought to be mediated through the tri-molecular CD47-TSP1-CD36 costimulatory complex, with TSP1 acting as a bridge between CD36 expressed on synoviocytes, and CD47 present on the T cells (Vallejo et al., 2000;Vallejo et al., 2003).

The strong upregulation of TSP1, CD36 and CD47 in IBM and DM adds to the growing list of molecules involved in chronic inflammatory myopathies. While previous studies have suggested an anti-angiogenic effect for TSP-1 in certain types of juvenile dermatomyositis (Lutz et al., 2002), its function in adult dermatomyositis remains to be clarified. The diverse role of these molecules in interaction with the extracellular matrix proteins, T cell activation, regulation of adhesion molecules and inflammatory response to amyloid, might allow them to serve as regulators of the inflammatory response and as possible intermediaries that link the degenerative products of IBM to inflammation. While our study does not specifically address the relationship between the degenerative component of IBM and inflammation, previous studies have demonstrated a role for these molecules in the inflammatory response to β-amyloid in other tissues. It is likely that a combined inflammatory and degenerative process exists in IBM (Dalakas, 1998;Dalakas, 2006b), where the chronic inflammation and amyloid formation are linked. In this model, various inflammatory mediators could promote cell stress and lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and degenerative products. One of these molecules that could perpetuate the inflammatory response and the deposits of misfolded proteins within the muscle could be CD36 and its interaction with TSP1 and CD47.
