Two major histocompatibility complex haplotypes influence susceptibility to sporadic inclusion body myositis: critical evaluation of an association with HLA-DR3

Abstract: Previous studies of sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) have shown a strong association with HLA-DR3 and other components of the 8.1 ancestral haplotype (AH) (HLA-A1, B8, DR3), where the susceptibility locus has been mapped to the central major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region between HLA-DR and C4. Here, the association with HLA-DR3 and other genes in the central MHC and class II region was further investigated in a group of 42 sIBM patients and in an ethnically similar control group (n ¼ 214), using single-nucleotide polymorphisms and microsatellite screening. HLA-DR3 (marking DRB1*0301 in Caucasians) was associated with sIBM (Fisher's test). However, among HLA-DR3-positive patients and controls, carriage of HLA-DR3 without microsatellite and single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles of the 8.1AH (HLA-A1, B8, DRB3*0101, DRB1*0301, DQB1*0201) was marginally less common in patients. Patients showed no increase in carriage of the 18.2AH (HLA-A30, B18, DRB3*0202, DRB1*0301, DQB1*0201) or HLA-DR3 without the central MHC of the 8.1AH, further arguing against HLA-DRB1 as the direct cause of susceptibility. Genes between HLA-DRB1 and HOX12 require further investigation. BTL-II lies in this region and is expressed in muscle. Carriage of allele 2 (exon 6) was more common in patients. BTL-II(E6)*2 is characteristic of the 35.2AH (HLA-A3, B35, DRB1*01) in Caucasians and HLA-DR1, BTL-II(E6)*2, HOX12*2, RAGE*2 was carried by several patients. The 8.1AH and 35.2AH may confer susceptibility to sIBM independently or share a critical allele.

Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) belongs to a group of acquired muscle diseases known as idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. The other diseases in this group are polymyositis and dermatomyositis. All three diseases cause chronic muscular weakness and are characterized by inflammatory infiltrates within skeletal muscle. sIBM largely affects Caucasians and is more common in males than in females (1). In the mostly Caucasian population of Western Australia, the incidence is 3.5 per 10 5 over the age of 50 years (2). sIBM is characterized histopathologically by nuclear and cytoplasmic filamentous inclusions and vacuoles rimmed by basophilic granules in Key words: ancestral haplotype; inclusion body myositis; MHC; microsatellite; single-nucleotide polymorphism the muscle fibers. Electron microscopy shows that these rimmed vacuoles correspond to membranous whorls in areas of cytoplasmic degradation (3). Hereditary IBM is a distinct condition that lacks the lymphocytic inflammation seen in sIBM and begins 10-30 years earlier. A role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of sIBM is supported by corticosteroid therapy having beneficial effects in some patients (4). Endomysial infiltrates comprise macrophages and T lymphocytes, notably CD8 T cells that invade muscle fibers and induce cytotoxic necrosis (5). However, the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of sIBM remains unclear.

sIBM occurs with other autoimmune diseases in up to 15% of patients. Associated conditions include systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjo ¨gren's syndrome, dermatomyositis, granulomatous liver disease, and scleroderma (6), supporting an autoimmune etiology for sIBM. This is consistent with observed association between sIBM and HLA alleles. A cohort of 30 patients has previously associated sIBM with carriage of DRB1*0301, DRB1*0101, DQB1*0201, and/or DRB1*0603 (7). A similar cohort of Australian patients showed that the clearest association is with a MHC haplotype defined by HLA-A1, B8, DRB3*0101, DRB1*0301, DQB1*0201 (8,9). This is known as the 8.1 ancestral haplotype (AH) and is highly conserved, being carried by 88% of Western Australians who have the HLA-B8 allele (10).

Identification of the critical MHC gene(s) affecting any disease is hampered by linkage disequilibrium, which is particularly strong in the 8.1AH. However, by comparing recombinant haplotypes generated by historical recombinations between known ancestral haplotypes in patients and an ethnically matched control population, one can begin to localize the gene or genes which have a direct effect on disease. This requires that the haplotypes are characterized by multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellite alleles. Using this approach, we have shown that the effect of class II alleles (DR3, DQ2) on type 1 diabetes is potentiated by a central MHC gene between TNFA and HLA-B (11). Here, the roles in sIBM of genes in the central We also considered BTL-II (butyrophilin-like MHC class II-associated gene; also known as BTNL2), which lies at the border of the class II and central MHC regions. It encodes six exons with homology to the butyrophilin gene family. Expression analyses of the BTL-II locus on mouse tissues showed expression in skeletal muscle and gut tissues (13). 

Materials and methods

Subjects

HLA typing

Class I and II alleles were assigned serologically in the Department of Clinical Immunology (Royal Perth Hospital) using a microcytotoxicity assay until 1992, when DNA-based class II typing was introduced. As the controls and some sIBM patients were typed serologically, high-resolution typing was downgraded for the calculation of allele frequencies. High-resolution typing is provided when available as the definition of haplotypes.

Single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assays for LMP2(3085), LMP7(37360), HOX12-628, and RAGE-443 Alleles of the complex polymorphism in exon 6 were detected using an SSCP assay. Amplicons were diluted in formamide buffer, denatured at 94 C for 5 min, snap-chilled, and separated on 12% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide gels with a cross-linking ratio of 99 : 1(200 V, 4 h). The identity of representative samples was confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Statistical analyses

Two-sided Fisher's exact tests were used to assess differences between patients and controls. P < 0.05 was accepted as a significant difference.

Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are shown.

Results

The 8.1AH rather than HLA-DR3 is associated with sIBM

We first confirmed that carriage of HLA-DR3 was increased in sIBM patients and showed increased carriage of HLA-B8 (reflecting the 8.1AH), but not HLA-B18 (  To determine whether the association with HLA-DR3 reflected carriage of a linked allele, patient and control samples preselected for carriage of HLA-DR3 were screened for microsatellite and SNP alleles characteristic of the 8.1AH in the central MHC (Table 3) and class II region (Table 4). These analyses showed the high conservation of the central MHC and class II region of the 8.1AH in patients and controls. However, HLA-DR3 without other markers of the central MHC of the 8.1AH was seen marginally less frequently in patient than control samples (Fisher's exact test; P ¼ 0.06). A similar pattern was evident in the class II region (P ¼ 0.004). Whilst the differences were small, the trend is opposite to that seen with markers of the 8.1AH telomeric of (and including) HOX12 or centromeric of (and including) LMP7. These were at least as common in patients as controls. Some samples were also typed for the G1152 microsatellite allele which lies near HLA-DQ. The results conformed with the distribution of alleles of LMP7 (data not shown).

An alternative approach to the analysis of these results reveals that patients and controls had similar carriage of HLA-DR3 without alleles but differ at all loci telomeric of (and including) DRB3. To define the most probable location of the critical gene, all recombinant haplotypes were represented graphically (Fig. 1). The results suggest a location between (and excluding) DRB1 and HOX12.

DNA was obtained from42 patients with clinically confirmed sIBM, treated at the Neuromuscular Clinic, Center for Neuromuscular and Neurological Disorders (Western Australia), the Department of Neurology, Royal Melbourne Hospital (Victoria) or the Department of Neurology, Royal Perth Hospital, Western Australia. All patients had slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness, with predominant involvement of the quadriceps femoris muscles in the lower limbs and forearm muscles in the upper limbs, plus biopsy-confirmed IBM (4). This comprised a predominantly T-cell infiltrate with invasion of myofibers, and the presence of rimmed vacuoles and tubulofilamentous inclusions in myofibers. Controls were retired donors who were from the Western Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry. As the patients and controls were mostly Caucasians resident in WesternAustralia for substantial periods, they are considered to be ethnically matched. Associations between alleles of novel polymorphic sites and known ancestral haplotypes were determined using DNA from wellcharacterized Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed cell lines, known to be homozygous for conserved MHC haplotypes(14).

Another 30 cycles of amplification followed for 20 s at each step with annealing temperatures at 58 C for D6S273 and TNFb and at 65 C for TNFa. A final 2-min extension was added for all microsatellites.Amplicons were resolved on an ABI Prism TM 310 Genetic Ana-lyzer using POP4 denaturing polyacrylamide (Perkin Elmer, CA,USA), as previously described (11). Alleles were assigned usingABI Prism TM GeneScan Analysis Software Version 3.1 (PerkinElmer), by comparison with a size marker included in each mix.Sequencing and SSCP analysis of BTL-IIPCR amplification of the six exons of BTL-II followed denaturation at94 C for 4 min; 18 cycles of touchdown amplification at 94 C for 30 s,64 C for 30 s (À0.5 C/cycle) and 72 C for 30 s (Table 1). A further 30cycles of amplification was performed for 30 s with an annealing tem-perature at 55 C. Amplicons were sequenced using BigDye TM Termin-ator chemistry (PE Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The mixture wasamplified for 25 cycles at 94 C for 30 s, 50 C for 20 s, and 60 C for 4 min.Bands were visualized by silver staining.reaction mixtures (25 ml) contained 10 ng genomic DNA, 50 ng primers (Table1), 2 mM MgCl 2 , 200 mM dNTP, and 0.2 U DNA polymerase. Samples were amplified as follows: denaturation at 94 C for 4 min for LMP2 and LMP7 or 3 min for HOX12 and RAGE, followed by 40 cycles (45 cycles for LMP7) at 94 C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s and 72 C for 1 min. Annealing temperatures were 63 C for LMP2, 58 C for LMP7, 60 C for HOX12, and 57 C for RAGE. A final 2-min extension time was added for LMP2 and LMP7. Amplicons were diluted in formamide buffer, denatured at 94 C for 5 min and snap-chilled on ice. LMP2 amplicons were separated on a 12% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide gel with a cross-linking ratio of 29 : 1 in precooled Â1 TBE buffer (200 V, 4 h). LMP7 and HOX12 amplicons were separated on a 10% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide gel with a cross-linking ratio of 75 : 1 in precooled Â1 Tris-borate EDTA (TBE) buffer (150 V, 16 h for LMP7 and 160 V, 5 h for HOX12). RAGE amplicons were separated on a 12% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide gel with a cross-linking ratio of 19 : 1 in Â1 TBE buffer (200 V, 24 h, 4 C).Typing D6S273, TNFa, and TNFb microsatellites PCR reactions for D6S273, TNFa, and TNFb have been described (Table1)(11,15). Microsatellites were amplified by denaturation at 95 C (5 min), followed by 8 cycles (7 cycles for TNFa) at 94 C for 20 s, annealing for 30 s (À1 C/cycle) and 72 C for 20 s. Annealing tem-peratures were 65 C for D6S273 and TNFb and 71 C for TNFa. Amplicons were precipitated with ethanol and sequencing reactions were run on an ABI 373 A DNA Sequencer with a BigDye TM filter wheel. The sequence text and chromatograms were aligned using the SeqEd TM Version 1.0.3 and compared with sequence from the UCSC Human Genome Project website (http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/).

As no patients were known to be of any Asiancomplex polymorphism in exon 6, comprising non-synonymous sub-descent, carriage of other markers of the 35.2AH was investigated. Astitutions at positions 57, 61, 99-100, and synonymous substitutionsregion of the 35.2AH defined by DR1, BTL-II(E6)*2, HOX12*T,at positions 133 and 163, was present in four patient samples. SSCPRAGE*T was carried by 8/31 DR3-positive sIBM patients and onlytyping of workshop cell lines representing 17 known ancestral haplo-5/59 DR3-positive controls (P ¼ 0.05). As one patient was homozygoustypes confirmed that exon 6 allele 2 (E6*2) marks the Caucasian 35.2AHfor the 35.2AH, it is possible that this haplotype and the 8.1AH(HLA-A3, B35, DR1) and the Asian 7.2AH (HLA-A24, B7, DR1) (dataindependently confer susceptibility to sIBM.not shown). This confirmed the results of Stammers et al. (13).DiscussionThis study established that sIBM could be promoted by allelescharacteristic of the 8.1AH or the 35.2AH. HLA-DR3 (8, 9) [orDRB1*03 (7)] has previously been associated with sIBM. However,when HLA-DR3-positive controls and sIBM patients were compared,carriage of HLA-DR3 without other components of the 8.1AH wasless common in patients, suggesting HLA-DR3 is not the direct causeof disease. This is supported by the lack of any association betweensIBM and the 18.2AH (HLA-A30, B18, DRB1*0301) and represents afundamental break with the traditional interpretation of HLA-DR3associations. Hence, it is worth reviewing previous studies of thecohort and comparing the 8.1 and 18.2AH.With a subset of the present cohort, Kok et al. (9) used novelmarkers of the 8.1AH in the HSP70 gene cluster to define a regionof the 8.1AH between HLA-DR3 and C4A that was carried by allDR3-positive patients. The authors suggested that the RAGE genemight mediate the genetic differences, as RAGE is a receptor for thebA4 fragment of amyloid precursor protein present in the rimmedvacuoles of skeletal muscle in sIBM and senile plaques of the brain inAlzheimer's disease(16). However, the HLA-DR typing was serological and hence reflected the DRB1 gene. MHC class II genes telomeric of DRB1 were not considered. Here, carriage of DR3 with no other markers of the 8.1AH was less common in patients, but the a LMP7 typing not available for three patients.

The boundary between the class II region and the central marks the most probable location for the gene affecting sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM).Carriage of markers of the 8.1 ancestral haplotype (AH) in sIBM patients with HLA-DR3 or -B8 is marked with filled circles. Each line represents one patient. Open symbols denote adjacent markers discordant from the 8.1AH. These represent the boundary of the major histocompatibility complex segment likely to contain the critical gene(s). Missing circles at LMP7 indicate samples for which typing was not available. Slippages of one repeat element of a microsatellite are shown as hatched symbols. Price et al : Two MHC haplotypes and inclusion body myositis Tissue Antigens 2004: 64: 575-580 effect was lost rapidly as we traversed the central MHC so the critical gene is likely to be close to DRB1. The 18.2AH and the 8.1AH share HLA-DRB1*0301, DQA1*0501, and DQB1*0201 but differ in carriage of DRB3*0202 (18.2AH) rather than DRB3*0101 (8.1AH) and at all loci telomeric of this gene. DRB3alleles have been associated with susceptibility to Graves' disease in African Americans(17) and Jamaicans(18). These studies compared the class II alleles of the 8.1 and 18.2AH (although this terminology was not used). Central MHC and other class II genes were not addressed and require further consideration, as the haplotypes diverge immediately telomeric of DRB1. This provides a precedent for consideration of DRB3 as a candidate gene. Other candidates (in chromosomal order away from DRB3) are DRA, BTL-II(13), TSBP (testis-specific basic protein), NOTCH4 (a transmembrane receptor which regulates cell fate decisions)(19), and G18 (a predicted gene with no known function)(20).BTL-II lies betweenTSBP and DRA and is expressed in skeletal muscle. Carriage of allele 2 of exon 6 was more common in the patients. As BTL-II(E6)*2 is characteristic of the 35.2AH (HLA-A3, B35, DR1) in Caucasians, carriage of other haplotypic markers was investigated. A region of the 35.2AH defined by HLA-DR1, BTL-I(E6)*2, HOX12*T, RAGE*T was more common among patients than controls. As several patients carried these alleles without any component of the 8.1AH, the two haplotypes may confer susceptibility to sIBM independently or may share a critical allele. Studies of further sIBM patients, including the rare cases from other ethnic groups, may help identify MHC genes responsible for susceptibility to sIBM.
