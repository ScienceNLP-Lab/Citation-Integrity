T-cell heterogeneity in muscle lesions of inclusion body myositis

In the muscle lesions of inclusion body myositis IBM , two populations of T cells can morphologically be distinguished, T cells that invade muscle fibers and T cells that remain in interstitial areas. Using combined immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, we analysed the TCR expressed by these distinct T cell populations. In three of eight IBM muscle specimens, the autoinvasive T cells were stained with one of the available mAbs: anti-Vb 5.3 in patient 1, anti-Vb 5.2 in patient 2, and anti-Vb 3 in patient 3. The corresponding TCR Vb mRNAs were amplified by RT-PCR and the PCR products were cloned and sequenced. In all three specimens, the TCRs expressed by the autoinvasive T cells were clonally restricted. Furthermore, in patient 1 two different mAbs labelled two distinct populations of T cells: an autoaggressive population of CD8 q Vb 5.3 q cells that invaded muscle fibers and a noninvasive interstitial population of CD8 y Vb 5.1 q cells. TCR sequence analysis revealed that the noninvasive Vb 5.1 q T cells were clonally diverse, whereas the autoinvasive Vb 5.3 q T cells were clonally restricted. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Materials and methods

Clinical material

IBM was diagnosed by established clinical, electrophys-Ž . iological and histological criteria Mikol and Engel, 1994 . All muscle specimens harboured congophilic inclusions in some affected fibers and all specimens contained an autoaggressive inflammatory exudate. Muscle biopsy specimens were stored in liquid nitrogen for several years before the present study was conducted.

Eight IBM specimens were immunocytochemically screened for TCR expression using a panel of anti-TCR Vb mAbs. In three specimens, the autoinvasive CD8 q T cells stained with one of the available mAbs. These specimens were selected for further analysis. RNA was extracted for TCR sequence analysis. For PCR experiments, control muscle and blood samples were obtained from two patients with neurogenic atrophy. HLA-typing was performed by PCR-SSP using DNA extracted from muscle and sequence-specific commercial oligonucleotide primers Ž . Dynal, Lake Success, NY, USA . The HLA types were as follows:

patient 1, A29,33rB58,65rDR13,17rDQ2,6; patient 2, A2,68rB44,62rDR1,11rDQ3,5; patient 3, A-,3rB8,35rDR1,17rDQ2,5.

Immunohistology

Six to 10 mm cryostat sections of muscle were used for single or two-color immunofluorescence analysis with Ž mouse FITC-anti-CD8 10 mgrml; Dianova, Hamburg, . Germany and the following mouse anti-TCR mAbs: Vb 5a . mgrml; Dianova -labelled goat anti-mouse IgG. For twocolor immunofluorescence analysis, sections were first treated with unlabelled anti-TCR Vb mAb and then with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. Next, the sections were blocked with 5% mouse serum and incubated with the FITC-labelled anti-CD8 antibody. Isotype-matched IgG at identical concentrations was substituted for primary antibodies for negative controls.

For immunohistological screening of TCR expression, immunoreactive cells were counted per high-power field at a final magnification of 250 diameters. Cell counts greater than 50 indicate 'high', between 5 and 50 'moderate', and below 5 'low' expression of a given TCR Vb element.

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was extracted from frozen muscle with TRISOL V following the manufacturer's instructions Ž . Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH . Singlestranded cDNA was synthesized from 2 mg of total RNA Ž . using oligo dT and Moloney murine leukaemia virus-de-Ž rived reverse transcriptase MBI-Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, . Germany .

PCR amplification of TCR Vb 3 and Vb5 sequences

Single-stranded cDNA was used as template. TCR b chains were amplified with 5 X -V gene family-specific  

All primers contained artificial EcoRI 5 primers or

Ž

. each primer in buffer supplied by the manufacturer AGS . The PCR was done for 35 cycles with 1 min denaturation at 948C, 1 min annealing at 608C, 1 min extension at 728C, and a final extension for 10 min at 728C in a thermal Ž . cycler Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT .

In control experiments with RNA extracted from peripheral blood cells of two patients with neurogenic atrophy, all TCR sequences obtained from cloned PCR products were different. No TCR transcripts were detected in control muscle.

Cloning and sequencing of PCR products

PCR products were cloned into EcoRI-and BamHI-digested puc18 for sequence analysis. After transfection into

. the E.coli strain DH5a GIBCO BRL , clones containing TCR Vb inserts were identified by hybridization with a Ž

X . GAACAC GC TT GT TTCAGGTCCT-3 . Positive clones were sequenced by using the dideoxy chain termi-Ž nation method with the Sequenase kit U.S. Biochemical, . Cleveland, OH . The cDNA sequences were screened against Genbank and EMBL nucleotide sequence databases. The TCR sequences were designated according to the Ž . current nomenclature Arden et al., 1995 . 

Results

Screening of TCR Vb expression with anti-Vb mAbs

The purpose of the screening experiment was to identify Ž specimens in which autoinvasive T cells i.e., T cells . invading muscle fibers could be stained with one of the currently available monoclonal antibodies. Eight IBM Ž . Ž . therefore CD8 y , are present X 500 also see Table 1 for results of the quantitative analysis . ( ) A. Bender et al.r Journal of Neuroimmunology 84 1998 86-91 89 muscle specimens were screened for TCR expression using a panel of mAbs directed against TCR-Vb 2, 3, 5. 1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.7, 8, 12.1, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.6, 16, 18, and 21.3. It should be noted that only about 50% of the human TCR Vb elements can be detected with the presently available anti-TCR Vb mAbs.

In three specimens, the autoinvasive CD8 q T cells were stained by one of the mAbs, namely anti-Vb 5.3 in patient 1, anti-Vb 5.2 in patient 2, and anti-Vb 3 in patient 3. Approximately 50 cells per high-power field stained with the indicated mAbs in these specimens. In the other Ž specimens, between 5 and 50 interstitial but not autoinva-. sive T cells per high-power field were stained with anti-Vb 5.1, 5.2, 6.7, 13.6 or 21.3.

Two-color immunofluorescence analysis of TCR expression

Next we analyzed the distribution of inflammatory T cells in patients 1, 2, and 3 using two-color fluorescence microscopy. In patient 1, two clearly distinct T cell populations were identified by differential reaction with two mAbs against the Vb 5 subfamilies Vb 5.3 and Vb 5.1 Ž . Table 1 and Fig. 1 . The Vb 5.3 q T cells were mostly CD8 q and included a significant proportion of autoinvasive T cells. In contrast, the Vb 5.1 q T cells were CD8 y and mainly localized in interstitial areas.

Six focal inflammatory lesions were analyzed quantita-Ž tively for coexpression of CD8 and TCR Vb 5.3 Table 1 . Ž and Fig. 1A , or CD8 and TCR Vb 5.1 Table 1 and Fig. . Ž . 1B . Of all CD8 q T cells, 33.5% 84r251 were Vb 5.3 Ž . q , whereas 0.4% 1r267 were Vb 5.1 q . Conversely, Ž . Ž Ž . 95.5% 84r88 of the Vb 5.3 q but only ; 4% 1r26 of . Ž . the Vb 5.1 q T cells were CD8 q Table 1A . Of the T Ž . cells that invaded muscle fibers, 50% 15r30 were Vb 5.3 Ž . q Table 1B . Only two invasive Vb 5.1 q T cells were Ž . detected, which were CD8 y Table 1B .

In patient 2, nine focal inflammatory lesions were ana-Ž . lyzed. Of all CD8 q T cells, 30.4% 86r283 were Vb 5.2 Ž Ž .. q . As in patient 1, a small population ; 4% 5r143 of Ž . Vb 5.1 q T cells was observed, 84% 26r31 of which were CD8 y . Scattered cells were Vb 6.7 q or 13.6 q . Five autoinvasive T cells were detected in this specimen, two of which were Vb 5.2 q . In patient 3, approximately 40% of all CD8 q T cells and a substantial proportion of autoinvasive T cells were Vb 3 q . Unfortunately, more precise quantification was impossible in this specimen owing to poor tissue preservation.

PCR and sequence analysis of TCRs expressed in muscle

To establish whether the expanded TCR Vb q T cell populations observed in patients 1, 2 and 3 were monoclonal, oligoclonal or polyclonal, we amplified cDNA from these muscle specimens using PCR and oligonucleo- tide primers specific for the TCR Vb families identified by immunohistochemistry. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced.

Using a TCR Vb 5-specific primer that amplifies all members of the Vb 5 family, we obtained 21 TCR se-Ž . quences from muscle of patient 1 Table 2A . Nine of these sequences were classified as Vb 5.3 and eight of these sequences were completely identical. In striking contrast, only two of the seven Vb 5.1 sequences and none of the other Vb 5 sequences were identical. Thus, in this Ž patient the population of Vb 5.3 q T cells which includes CD8 q autoinvasive T cells as revealed by immunohisto-. chemistry was essentially monoclonal, whereas the inter-Ž . stitial noninvasive CD8 y Vb 5.1 q T cells were clonally diverse.

In patient 2, 5 of the 7 amplified Vb 5.2 sequences were identical, whereas most of the other amplified Vb 5 se-Ž . quences were different Table 2B . Note that some of the Ž . few autoinvasive T cells identified in this patient were Ž . Vb 5.2 q by immunohistochemistry see Section 3.2 . In patient 3, a Vb 3-specific TCR family primer was used for ( ) A. Bender et al.r Journal of Neuroimmunology 84 1998 86-91 90 PCR amplification. Eight of 14 Vb 3 sequences were iden-Ž . tical Table 2C .

Thus, in all three patients analyzed, the immunocytochemically identified population of autoinvasive T cells is oligoclonal or even monoclonal by TCR sequence analysis. In patient 1, a complementary population of CD8 y interstitial T cells were stained with a mAb against Vb 5.1. These Vb 5.1 q interstitial T cells were clonally diverse. Furthermore, in control experiments, the same PCR primers were used for amplification of TCR Vb sequences from Ž . blood of two control subjects see Section 2 . As expected, all TCR sequences obtained from blood were different.

Discussion

Our results demonstrate that the autoinvasive and interstitial T cells in IBM muscle express a different TCR repertoire. Patient 1 was especially informative. Here, two different mAbs serendipitously labelled two distinct populations of T cells: a CD8 q Vb 5.3 q population of autoinvasive T cells and a CD8 y Vb 5.1 q population of noninvasive interstitial T cells. PCR and TCR sequence analysis revealed that only the autoinvasive Vb 5.3 q T cells were clonally restricted, whereas the interstitial Vb 5.1 q T cells were clonally diverse. This case, therefore, illustrates the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of the T cell infiltrate in muscle lesions. Indeed, we have previously Ž noted this phenomenon in a case of PM Bender et al., . 1995 . Other workers have investigated the TCR repertoire Ž . in IBM immunocytochemically Lindberg et al., 1994 or Ž . by PCR O'Hanlon et al., 1994;Fyhr et al., 1996 , but  Both techniques employed in our study, immunohistochemistry with TCR Vb family-specific mAbs and RT-PCR with Vb-family specific oligonucleotide primers, have their limitations. First, immunohistochemical analysis is constrained by the presently available panel of anti-TCR Vb mAbs that detect only about 50% of the existing TCR Vb elements. Second, PCR results are difficult to quantify and do not distinguish between pathogenetically relevant and irrelevant TCRs. To circumvent these limitations and to make optimal use of the information obtained with either technique, we combined the immunocytochemical analysis with PCR, using the same approach that enabled us to demonstrate a restricted TCR repertoire in PM ŽPluschke et al., 1992;Hohlfeld et al., 1991;Bender et al., . 1995 . Because only about 50% of the Vb specificities are recognized by the available antibodies, not all cases of IBM are amenable to analysis by the combined approach. This likely explains why the autoinvasive T cells were stained only in three of the eight screened IBM cases.

Because concomitant blood samples were unavailable from the patients whose cryopreserved muscle specimens we studied, we cannot state whether the TCRs expressed by autoinvasive T cells in muscle were also expressed by T cells circulating in blood at the time of biopsy. However, in our previous studies on PM mediated either by abor gd-T cells, we did not detect myocytotoxic T cell clones in parallel blood samples by immunofluorescence or even Ž PCR Bender et al., 1995;Hohlfeld et al., 1991;Pluschke . et al., 1992 . This strongly suggests that in inflammatory myopathies the autoaggressive T cells can accumulate and probably locally expand in muscle without circulating in blood in detectable amounts at the time of biopsy.

Ž . Although the identity of the target antigen s in IBM remains unknown, the known properties of the HLA class Ž I-restricted pathway of antigen presentation Germain, . Ž . Ž 1994 predict that the antigen s presented are short 8-10-. mer peptides, derived mostly from endogenously synthesized viral or self proteins. Moreover, the failure of repeated attempts to identify viral antigens or genomes in Ž IBM Leon-Monzon and Dalakas, 1992;Jongen et al., 1993;Fox et al., 1994;Leff et al., 1992;Nishino et al., . 1989 weighs in favor of an autoimmune reaction against Ž . muscle self antigen s . This, however, does not preclude triggering of the autoimmune response by a viral infection Ž . by molecular mimicry Fujinami and Oldstone, 1985 . The likelihood of an autoimmune mechanism in IBM is further strengthened by the clinical association with other autoim-Ž mune diseases Mikol and Engel, 1994;Sekul and Dalakas, . 1993;Dalakas and Sivakumar, 1996 , and by the immuno-Ž genetic association with HLA-DR3 Garlepp et al., 1994;. Sivakumar et al., 1997 . Muscle fibers are exceptional as potential targets of cytotoxic CD8 q T cells in that they normally do not express detectable levels of HLA. In the inflammatory myopathies, however, many muscle fibers express abun-Ž . dant HLA class I but only very rarely HLA class II Ž . Karpati et al., 1988;Emslie-Smith et al., 1989 . Because HLA expression can be enhanced in cultured myotubes by Ž stimulation with interferon-g Goebels et al., 1992; . Michaelis et al., 1993 , at least part of the observed HLA expression may be induced by locally secreted cytokines. Cytokines likely influence not only HLA expression but also antigen processing by muscle fibers, favoring the presentation of self proteins that normally occur only in Ž . small amounts Hohlfeld and Engel, 1994 . Apart from inflammatory changes, microscopic findings in IBM include rimmed vacuoles, congophilic amyloid deposits typically near or within the vacuoles and occasionally in nuclei, necrotic and regenerating fibers, small groups of atrophic fibers, and mitochondrial abnormalities ŽAskanas et al., 1994;Mikol and Engel, 1994;Griggs et . al., 1995;Carpenter, 1996 . The relative significance of these alterations and their possible relation to the inflam-Ž . matory changes are presently debated Griggs et al., 1995 . That nonnecrotic muscle fibers invaded by T cells are several fold more frequent than fibers displaying other Ž . pathologic alterations Pruitt et al., 1996 suggests that, despite refractoriness to immunotherapy, immune mechanisms play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBM.
