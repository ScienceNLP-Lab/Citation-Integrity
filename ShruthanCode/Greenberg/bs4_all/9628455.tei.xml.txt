HLA allele distribution distinguishes sporadic inclusion body myositis from hereditary inclusion body myopathies

We studied the HLA class II associations in patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis s-IBM and hereditary inclusion body Ž . myopathies h-IBM and attempted to distinguish these myopathies on the basis of HLA allele assignments.

Introduction

Inclusion body myopathies are currently classified as Ž . sporadic inclusion body myositis s-IBM , or hereditary Ž . inclusion body myopathies h-IBM . s-IBM is characterized clinically by a specific pattern of proximal and distal weakness, with an early predilection for quadriceps and Ž forearm flexor muscles Lotz et al., 1989;Dalakas, 1991; . Sekul and Dalakas, 1993;Mikol and Engel, 1994 . h-IBM covers a heterogeneous group of vacuolar myopathies with an autosomal recessive or dominant pattern of inheritance and a characteristic quadriceps-sparing pattern in some Ž ethnic groups Argov and Yarom, 1984;Neville et al., . 1992;Sadeh et al., 1993;Sivakumar and Dalakas, 1996 . Histolological hallmarks of s-IBM include endomysial inflammation with cytotoxic T cells invading nonnecrotic Ž . muscle fibers Arahata and Engel, 1988 , rimmed vacuoles, amyloid deposition, and nuclear or cytoplasmic Ž filamentous inclusions Lotz et al., 1989;Dalakas, 1991; . Sekul and Dalakas, 1993;Mikol and Engel, 1994 . In h-IBM, the muscle histology reveals rimmed vacuoles with nuclear or cytoplasmic filamentous inclusions but, in contrast to s-IBM, deposits of b-amyloid are less frequently observed, inflammation is rare and expression of MHC-I Ž antigen is scarcely observed in the myofibers Argov and . Yarom, 1984;Sivakumar and Dalakas, 1996 . s-IBM is frequently associated with various nonspecific autoantibodies or other autoimmune disorders at a rate as Ž high as that reported for myasthenia gravis Koffman et . al., 1998 . In several small series, s-IBM has been associ-Ž ated with HLA-DR3, HLA-DR52, and HLA-DQ2 Love et . Ž al., 1991 or HLA-DR3, HLA-DR52 and HLA- B8 Garlepp . et al., 1994 . In the present study we sought not only to confirm this MHC class II association in a larger group of patients but to distinguish the sporadic and familial phenotypes of IBM on the basis of HLA allele assignments.  Koffman et al.r Journal of Neuroimmunology 84 1998139-142 140 et al., 1989;Dalakas, 1991;Sekul and Dalakas, 1993; . Mikol and Engel, 1994 were prospectively screened.

Methods

Patients

Fifteen previously described patients with h-IBM Ž . Sivakumar and Dalakas, 1996 were concurrently screened. They included 12 patients from 5 families with autosomal dominant and 3 patients from 2 families with autosomal recessive h-IBM. All 3 of the autosomal reces-Ž sive patients had the quadriceps-sparing phenotype Argov . and Yarom, 1984;Sivakumar and Dalakas, 1996 . All s-IBM patients and 14 of the h-IBM patients were Caucasian.

DNA typing of HLA class II genes

HLA class II allele-specific oligonucleotide typing was performed on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood, using polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific Ž . primer mixtures SSPM for 71 alleles contained in the DQ b1 and DRb1, DRb 3, DRb4 and DRb5 loci, based Ž . on the method of Park and Tonai 1992 . HLA nomenclature is reported based on the World Health Organization Nomenclature Committee for factors of the HLA system Ž . Bodmer et al., 1995 .

Statistical analysis

We compared the frequency of the highest represented alleles in the amplified products derived from the s-IBM patients to those in a control caucasoid population of 1331 Ž . individuals Park and Tonai, 1992 . Comparison between s-IBM and h-IBM allele frequencies was also made. Strength of the association between the disease and HLA allele was expressed by the odds ratio and the statistical significance was examined by using the c 2 test with Yates correction. The p value was calculated for each allele tested. The odds ratio was calculated using the allele frequencies in the s-IBM or h-IBM populations compared to control population.

Results

The s-IBM patients were most frequently found to have the following alleles associated with DR and DQ pheno-  The cumulative percentages of each allele for each serotype agreed with previously published serological anti-Ž . gen frequencies Lee, 1990 .

Discussion

We found a strong association with alleles in the DR3 locus in patients with s-IBM but not h-IBM. The finding indicates that s-IBM is distinct not only clinically but also immunogenetically from the group of patients with h-IBM and raises the possibility that immunogenetic factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of s-IBM.

DR3 has been associated with many autoimmune dis-  Arnett et al., . 1988;Love et al., 1991;Garlepp et al., 1994 . The present correlative findings between s-IBM and h-IBM provide additional support that at least the inflammatory component of s-IBM is driven by an autoimmune process linked with the HLA-DR3 locus.

Although in s-IBM, but not h-IBM, there are immunocytochemical signs of T-cell mediated and MHC class I restricted cytotoxicity identical to those seen in polymyosi-Ž . tis Arahata and Engel, 1988;Hohlfeld and Engel, 1994 , the patients with IBM do not generally respond to immunotherapies, raising questions about the antigenic specificity of the T-cell response. Although the prominent usage Ž . of the T-cell receptor TCR Vb 3 and Vb 6 gene families detected in the endomysial lymphocytes in s-IBM, has generated the hypothesis that the T-cell response may be Ž driven by superantigens O'Hanlon et al., 1994;Lindberg . et al., 1994 , a clonal expansion of the T cell by a muscle-specific antigen has not been excluded. The strong associations with HLA-DR alleles found in the present study suggest that in s-IBM the T lymphocytes may be ( ) B.M. Koffman et al.r Journal of Neuroimmunology 84 1998 139-142 142 activated during initiation of the disease by peptide fragments bound to specific loci of the MHC molecule in individual of certain immunogenetic background. In contrast, in h-IBM where an inherited disease gene is presum-Ž ably responsible for certain forms of the disease Mitrani-. Rosenbaum et al., 1996 , endomysial infiltrates are absent Ž . Sivakumar and Dalakas, 1996 , and no disease association with an HLA locus was noted.

The strong association of certain alleles with s-IBM, but not h-IBM, provides additional evidence that h-IBM is a heterogeneous group of diseases not associated with HLA-D region loci, while s-IBM is a homogeneous disorder with an immunogenetic background. This is also strengthened by our previous observations in three unique families where seven affected members had an inflammatory inclusion body myositis with not only the characteristic immunopathological and clinical features of s-IBM but also with the same DRb1 ) 0301rDRb1 ) 0302 alleles, corre-Ž . sponding to the DR3 phenotype Sivakumar et al., 1997 . This association links further the inflammatory component of s-IBM to genes related to the MHC class II locus and may provide the impetus to search for clonal expansion of the autoagressive CD8 q T cells or examine whether certain cytokines associated with the DR3 locus, such as TNFa , contribute to an antigen-specific recruitment of the activated T cells.

Although s-IBM has unique clinical and histological features allowing for accurate diagnosis, atypical clinical features or histological findings such as absence of inflammation, amyloid deposits, or vacuoles, may at times hinder the correct diagnosis. In addition, in some IBM cases of possible familial inheritance, history of other sibling or family member involvement may not be readily available. Immunogenetic studies searching for the above described alleles in the DR3 locus may aid in the distinction of such patients.
