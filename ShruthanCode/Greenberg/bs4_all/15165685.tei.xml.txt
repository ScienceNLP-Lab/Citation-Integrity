The molecular pathophysiology in inflammatory myopathies

Clinical features

On the basis of unique clinical, immunopathologic, demographic, histologic and prognostic criteria, along with different response to therapies, the inflammatory myopathies comprise of three major subsets: Polymyositis (PM), Dermatomyositis (DM) and Inclusion-Body Myositis (IBM) [1,2]. The diseases are clinically important because they represent the largest group of acquired and potentially treatable myopathies both in children and adults.

All three forms have in common a myopathy characterized by proximal and often symmetric muscle weakness that develops relatively slowly (weeks to months) and occasionally insidiously, as in IBM, but rarely acutely. DM is a distinct clinical entity identified by a characteristic heliotrope rash on the upper eyelids, face or upper truck that accompanies, or more often precedes, the evolving muscle weakness [1,2]. PM mimics many other myopathies and it is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is best defined as an inflammatory myopathy that develops subacutely, over weeks to months, progresses steadily and occurs in adults who do not have a rash, involvement of the extraocular and facial muscles (mild facial weakness is seen in IBM but not in PM), family history of a neuromuscular disease, history of exposure to myotoxic drugs or toxins, endocrinopathy, neurogenic disease, dystrophy, biochemical muscle disorder or inclusion-body myositis, as determined by muscle enzyme histochemistry and biochemistry [1,2]. It is now increasingly recognized that PM, occurring in isolation, is a rare and rather overdiagnosed disorder; it is more often seen in association with systemic autoimmune or connective tissue diseases, or with known viral or bacterial infection [2]. IBM is the most common acquired myopathy in men above 50 years old. Although it is commonly suspected when a patient with presumed PM does not respond to therapy, involvement of distal muscles, especially foot extensors and deep finger flexors, in almost all the cases, may be a clue to the early clinical diagnosis [1,2]. Dysphagia is common, occurring in up to 60% of the patients, especially late in the disease [1,2].

The clinically suspected diagnosis of PM, DM, or IBM is established or confirmed by elevated activity of the musclederived serum enzymes, electromyographic findings, and muscle biopsy [1][2][3][4]. Muscle biopsy is the definitive test for establishing the diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy and for excluding other neuromuscular diseases. Inflammation is the histologic hallmark for these diseases; however, additional features are characteristic of each subtype [3,4]. In PM and IBM the inflammation is primary, a term used to indicate that T cell infiltrates, located primarily within the muscle fascicles (endomysially), surround individual, healthy muscle fibers that eventually invade resulting in phagocytosis and necrosis [1][2][3][4]. The MHC-1 expression is ubiquitously expressed on the sarcolemma even in fibers not invaded by CD8+ cells [1][2][3][4][5]. The CD8/MHC-1 lesion is fundamental for confirming the diagnosis of PM and excluding disorders with secondary, non-specific inflammation, as seen in various toxic, metabolic or dystrophic myopathies [2]. In IBM, in addition to the inflammation, there are granular deposits distributed around the edge of slit-like vacuoles (rimmed vacuoles) along with tiny congophilic amyloid deposits within or next to the vacuoles, best visualized by Texas-red fluorescent optics [3,4]. Search for the CD8/MHC-1 expression should be in the diagnostic criteria of PM to avoid misdiagnoses, as recently emphasized [2]. In DM the endomysial inflammation is predominantly perivascular or in the interfascicular septae and around, rather than within, the muscle fascicles. The muscles fibers undergo necrosis, degeneration, and phagocytosis, often in groups involving a portion of a muscle fasciculus in a wedge-like shape or at the periphery of the fascicle, due to microinfarcts within the muscle [1][2][3][4] resulting in perifascicular atrophy.

Molecular immunopathogenesis

In DM, the endomysial infiltrates have a higher than normal percentage of B cells, a higher ratio of CD4+ cells (helper cells) to CD8+ cells (suppressor-cytotoxic T cells), proximity of CD4+ cells to B cells and macrophages, and a relative absence of lymphocytic invasion of nonnecrotic muscle fibers, all of which suggest a mechanism mediated primarily by humoral processes [1][2][3][4][5]. The immune process is directed against microvascular antigens and is mediated by the complement C5b-9 membranolytic attack complex, resulting in necrosis of the endothelial cells, reduced numbers of endomysial capillaries, ischemia, muscle-fiber destruction often resembling microinfarcts, and inflammation. The remaining capillaries have dilated lumen in an effort to compensate for the ischemic process.

In PM and IBM there is evidence of an antigen-directed cytotoxicity mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells [1][2][3][4][5][6]. This conclusion is supported by the presence of CD8+ cells which, along with macrophages, initially surround and eventually invade and destroy healthy, nonnecrotic, muscle fibers that aberrantly express class I MHC molecules. MHC-I expression, absent from the sarcolemma of normal muscle fibers, is probably induced by cytokines secreted by activated T cells and macrophages. The CD8/MHC-I complex is characteristic for PM and IBM; its detection has now become necessary to confirm the histological diagnosis of PM. The cytotoxic autoinvasive CD8+ T cells contain perforin and granzyme granules directed towards the surface of the muscle fibers; these granules are capable of inducing necrosis of the muscle cell.

In PM and IBM, certain infiltrating endomysial CD8+ T cells of specific T cell Receptor (TCR) families are clonally expanded and their CDR3 region, the antigen-binding region of the TCR, has conserved aminoacid sequences, suggesting an antigen-driven T cell response [7][8][9]. In contrast, the non-invasive, bystander T cells are clonally diverse. Sequential muscle biopsy specimens has further shown a persistent clonal restriction of the same TCR families suggesting that the endomysial T cells appear driven continuously by the same, heretofore unknown, antigen(s) [10,11]. The B7family of costimulatory molecules, BB-1 and ICOS (Inducible Costimulator), and their ligands CD28/CTLA-4 and LICOS are also upregulated on the muscle fibers and the autoinvasive CD8+ T cells [11,12]. In addition, T cellderived cytokines (IL 2,4,5 ,IFN-c), macrophage-derived cytokines (IL 1 , IL 6 , TNFa), chemokines MCP-1 (CCL2), Mig (CXCL9) and their receptors, matrix metalloproteinsases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), adhesion molecules on leukocytes (L-selectin and integrins LFA-1, VLA-4) and their respective ligands on endothelial cells (GlyCAM-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1), are upregulated in patients with PM and IBM and facilitate the adhesion and transmigration of activated T cells through the endothelial cell wall [2,13].

Treatment

Present therapies

Because the specific target antigens in DM, PM and IBM are unknown, the immunosuppressive therapies are not selectively targeting the autoreactive T cells or the complement-mediated process on the intramuscular blood vessels. Instead, they are inducing a non-selective immunosuppression or immunomodulation. Agents used in the treatment of PM and DM include: Corticosteroids, Azathioprine, Methotrexate, Cyclophosphamide, Chlorambucil, Cyclosporine, Mycophenolate Mofetil, and Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) which is the only drug tested in control trials [14,15]. IVIg was first shown to be effective in uncontrolled studies [15]. A first double-blind study conducted, demonstrated that IVIg is effective in patients with refractory DM [16]. Not only the strength improves but the underlying immunopathology resolves. A controlled double-blind study for PM has never been completed [17]. IVIg has also exerted some benefit, although not statistically significant, in up to 30% of patients with IBM in a controlled double-blind study [18]. Although the improvement was not dramatic, it made a difference to these patients' life styles especially on dysphagia.

Future immunotherapies

Progress in molecular immunology promises a more target-oriented immunotherapy in the years to come targeting: (a) the signal transduction in T lymphocytes, using monoclonal antibodies against CD52, CD3, CD45, ICAM, LFA3 or IL2R; (b) immunomodulating cytokines, such as TNF-a or interferons; and (c) adhesion molecules and receptors, such as MMP-2 and MMP-9, integrins and their receptors [14].
