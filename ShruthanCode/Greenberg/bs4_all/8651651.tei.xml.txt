Multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions in sporadic inclusion body myositis: A study of 56 patients

Inclusion body myositis, a chronic inflammatory disorder, is the most common cause of myopathy in adults over the age of 50. Diagnosis is based on clinical features and distinctive morphological findings by both light and electron microscopy. The causes of inclusion body myositis are still unknown. Ultrastructural mitochondrial changes and raggedred fibers are common in patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis, and mutiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions have been reported in 3 such patients, suggesting that mtDNA mutations may have a pathogenetic role. We studied 56 patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis, using a combination of clinical, morphological, biochemical, and molecular genetic analyses to determine the frequency and the distribution of mtDNA deletions. Using the polymerase chain reaction, we found multiple mtDNA deletions in 73% of patients, compared to 40% of normal age-matched control subjects and 47% of disease control subjects. The presence of deletions correlated with morphological evidence of ragged-red, cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers, and with defects of complexes I and IV of the electron transport chain. Although aging may account for a proportion of mtDNA deletions in patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis and control subjects, mtDNA alterations may be accelerated in sporadic inclusion body myositis.

familial forms have been reported, with an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance. Because muscle biopsy specimens from patients with familial disease usually lack inflammation, this form of the disorder should be referred to as hereditary inclusion body myopathy (h-IBM) [2, 31. The diagnosis of inclusion body myositis (IBM) is based on clinical and laboratory features, and recognition of the distinctive morphological findings by both light and electron microscopy (EM). In particular, muscle biopsy specimens show inflammatory myopathy with mononuclear cell invasion of nonnecrotic fibers, vacuolated fibers (rimmed vacu-oles), and intracellular amyloid deposits or 15to 18nm tubulofilaments by EM [4-71. These criteria were revised recently and more accurate diagnostic guidelines for definite and possible IBM were proposed (81.

However, rimmed vacuoles and twisted tubulofilamentous inclusions are not specific for IBM, as they have been observed in other neuromuscular disorders, such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) Ultrastructural mitochondrial changes [ 12, 131 and ragged-red fibers (RRFs) [14] are commonly observed in sporadic disease, whereas they are rare in familial forms. These changes are typically seen in mitochondrial myopathies and encephalomyopathies, many of which are due to sporadic or inherited defects of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [ 151.

A recent in situ hybridization study showed the pres- [9-111. ence of deleted m t D N A molecules in cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient fibers from 3 IBM patients [16]. Although deleted genomes were detected by Southern blot in only 1 patient, these findings suggested that m t D N A deletions might have a pathogenetic role in IBM. These findings have now been confirmed in additional patients using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method [ 171.

To determine the frequency and the distribution of m t D N A deletions in s-IBM, and to investigate the relationship between clinical phenotype a n d m t D N A abnormalities, we studied a large series of s-IBM patients by a combination of clinical, morphological, biochemical, and molecular genetic analyses. W e also studied 30 age-matched normal individuals and 46 disease control subjects with other myopathies or encephalomyopathies, including 18 patients with polymyositis and 4 with dermatomyositis.

Materials and Methods

We studied 56 s-IBM patients, 35 men and 21 womcn, with a mean age of 61 t 15 years (range, 30-77 years). For diagnosis, we used established clinical and morphological criteria, including slow progressive and painless muscle weakness of proximal and distal muscles, endomysial inflammatory infiltrates in the muscle biopsy specimen, presence of at least one rimmed vacuole/low-power field, and presence of characteristic intracytoplasniic tubulofilaments on EM.

Control subjects were divided into two groups: Total DNA extraction from muscle, preparation of mtDNA probes using a random primed DNA kit (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), and Southern blot analysis were performed as described [ZO]. Briefly, about 2 to 5 pg of total DNA was cut with either PvuII or BdmHI (which linearized mtDNA molecules), run on a 0.8% agarose gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane (Zetaprobe, Riorad, Hercules, CA), and hybridized with 1 to 2 X 106 cpm/ml of total human placental mtDNA probes. Washes were performed according to the nianufacturers' instructions.

Deletions were mapped using a combination of Southern blot, PCR-derived methods, and direct sequencing techniques. To map the deleted areas, total DNA was digested and subjected to electrophoresis as described above, then blotted onto two nylon membranes, and hybridized overnight to a set of probes corresponding to different regions of mtDNA. The fragments used as probes were PCR amplified from mtDNA extracted from normal human muscle, using oligonucleotide primers with nucleotide (nt) positions corresponding to the following Cambridge sequence [21] positions on the heavy (H) or on the light (L) strand, (5'-3'):

( The fragments were purified by Gene Clean (Bio 101, Vista, CA) and labeled as described above. The membranes were stripped before each new hybridization, and then exposed overnight to x-ray film (Kodak-XAR) at -70Â°C with an intensifying screen, to verify the absence of any previous radioactive signal.

To verify that the additional bands obtained in the Southern blots were not due to DNA degradation, we hybridized our blots with a nuclear 18s ribosomal RNA probe [22]. An added advantage of this procedure was that it also allowed us to rule out primary quantitative defects of mtDNA.

A finer map of the deleted areas was obtained using the "primer shifting" method [23). This technique allowed us to rule out nonspecific PCR amplification and to obtain a better localization of the deleted regions. The following pairs of primers were used on both (H) and (L) strands, (5'-3'): Sequence analysis of the major bands obtained with the fourth, fifth, and sixth pairs of primers was performed to localize the deletion breakpoints [24].

The relative number of delected molecules in 18 IRM patients was estimated by densitonietric scanning of the autoradiograms, using MD-Image Quant software version 3.22 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).

The presence of the common deletion of approximately 5.0 kb was quantitated in 20 IBM patients and 18 control subjects (10 normal control subjects and 8 disease control subjects), employing a described I'CR method [ 181. Coamplification of documented nondeleted mtDNA regions (using the same PCR conditions) was performed to ensure uniformity in amplification of wild-type genomes.

In a representative sample of 15 patients, we also excluded the presence of mtDNA point mutations that have been associated with mitochrondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes (MELAS) [25, 

Results

The In 26 IBM patients (46%), multiple deletions of mtDNA were evident both by Southern blotting and by PCR. However, PCR revealed deleted genomes in an additional 15 patients, in whom Southern blotting results were negative. Thus, multiple mtDNA deletions were detected in 41 patients, or 73% of the total. No mtDNA deletions were found by Southern blotting in age-matched control subjects, but deletions were seen in 4 disease control subjects. These patients had been diagnosed as having polymyosiris with RRFs. PCR revealed mtDNA deletions in I 2 normal individuals (40%) and in 22 disease control subjects (47%). No primary mtDNA depletion was detected calculating the ratio between mtDNA and nuclear DNA [22].

The pattern of observed deletions was the same in most patients (Fig 2 ): it consisted of the 16.5-kb band, corresponding to wild-type mtDNA, and of a smearing of several smaller bands, some of which, ranging in size from 11.5 to 7.5 kb, were more evident. Figure 3 shows a representative Southern blot pattern. All bands were revealed by the first three probes (total mtDNA, probe 1, and probe 2), while probe 4, which encompassed the genes for ATPase 8 and 6 and for part of COX 111, did not hybridize with the two lower bands of 7.5 and 8.5 kb. Probe 6, which includes a small portion of ND3, transfer RNA (tRNA)*'g, ND4L, ND4, t m ~H ~s , tmAScr(AGY), tmAWCUN) , and part of ND5, hybridized only wirh wild-type DNA, suggesting that those genes are included in all deleted areas.

Better localization of the deletions was obtained by PCR. For example, using primer pairs (5'-3') nt 8274-8305 and nt 13720-13692, a strong band of approximately 0.5 kb, and several less intense bands of up to 1.3 kb were obtained. Primer pairs nt 8274-8305 and nt 15600-15574 gave bands ranging from approximately 2.4 kb to 0.8 kb, while fewer or no bands were obtained with primer pairs nt 8274-8305 and nt 12995-12966, and with pairs nt 9007-9036 and nt 15600-15574. This indicates that most deletions include the region between nt 9000 and nt 13000. In several patients, we also detected a previously reported 3895-bp deletion in the region of the heavy-strand promoter (HSP) region, which, however, spares the lightstrand promoter [31].

Direct sequencing identified the deletion breakpoints of the more intense bands obtained by PCR.

For example, using primer pair e as described already, we identified an approximately 0.5-kb band, indicating the presence of the common deletion of 4977 bp first described by Schon and colleagues [32]. A positive correlation was seen between presence of morphological mitochondrial abnormalities (i.e., RRF/ COX-negative fibers), biochemical impairment of mitochondria] function (complex I and IV deficiencies), and presence of deletions by Southern blot in IBM patients ( p < 0.05). However, we found no correlation between presence of deletions and gender, age, or any of the main clinical features.

Discussion

While the etiology and pathogenesis of s-IBM are unknown, mitochondrial abnormality, as reflected by the presence of W s , is a common finding in muscle biopsy specimens, thus raising the possibility that impaired energy metabolism may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Even though RRFs are not specific for IBM and are found in muscle biopsy specimens of aged normal individuals, they are more abundant in patients with IBM [33].

Recent studies by Oldfors and coworkers [16,171 documenting the presence of multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle from s-IBM patients prompted us to investigate the frequency of mtDNA rearrangements in a large group of patients. Our series consisted of 56 patients with s-IBM from four institutions, conforming to the clinical and pathological criteria recently established for accurate diagnosis [8]. We confirmed the frequent occurrence of multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle from IBM patients. By Southern blot analysis, which is capable of detecting deletions affecting as few as 1 to 2% of total mitochondrial genomes, 46% of our patients harbored multiple deletions. With the much more sensitive PCR technique, whose power of resolution is considered as low as 0.01% (F. Pallotti and E. A.  [48].

The gene responsible for AD-PEO in a large Finnish family was localized to chromosome 1Oq23-24.3, but two AD-PEO Italian families failed to show linkage with that locus, suggesting genetic heterogeneity [49].

Both the origin of multiple mtDNA deletions and their pathogenic role remain uncertain in other conditions. In s-IBM, a primary pathogenic role appears unlikely for several reasons: (1) Multiple mtDNA deletions are undetectable in a substantial number of patients (27% of our patients did not harbor deleted genomes); (2) in patients with deletions, their abundance does not correlate with clinical severity; (3) patients with AD-PEO or AR-PEO show neither the distribution of weakness that is characteristic of IBM nor the rimmed vacuoles and tubulofilamentous inclusions that are the hallmark changes in IBM muscle biopsy specimens; and (4) conversely, ophthalmoplegia, the signature clinical feature associated with primary mtDNA multiple deletions, is never seen in patients with IBM.

If the intranuclear filaments reflect a primary in- volvement of the nuclei in the pathogenesis of IBM, one of the consequences might be a defect in the same nuclear gene (or genes) involved in AD-PEO and AR-PEO. Aging processes, duration of disease, and their combined effects on oxidative phosphorylation could influence the clinical expression.

It also would be tempting to speculate that the same genes may be responsible for h-IBM. Although multiple deletions appear to be less frequent in patients with h-IBM than in patients with s-IBM [50], this observation has to be confirmed in a larger series of h-IBM patients.

In 1 patient, we detected a novel deletion of 3985 bp in the HSP region, between nt 502 and nt 4487.

Pestronk, B. Frank, unpublished manuscript, 1995). At any rate, our data indicate that multiple mtDNA deletions are more abundant in IBM patients than can be explained by age or concomitantleted mtDNA molecules in IBM patients and controlsubjects we found that multiple deletions accumulatedwith age in both groups, but were more abundant inIBM patients.A comparison of IBM patients with and those with-out deleted genomes showed no apparent correlationbetween percentage of deletions and age at onset orclinical severity. Not surprisingly, the presence of dele-tions correlated with mitochondria1 abnormalities inthe muscle biopsy specimen and with decreased activi-ties of respiratory chain enzymes. Similar morphologi-cal and biochemical changes are seen in muscle frompatients with Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) or sporadicprogressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and inpatients with autosomal dominant PEO (AD-PEO).In these conditions, single or multiple deletions ofmtDNA include one or more tRNA genes and causeoveraIl impairment of mitochondrial protein synthesis,leading to mitochondrial proliferation (RRFs or SDH-hyperreactive fibers) and to decreased activities of thoserespiratory chain complexes that contain mtDNA-encoded subunits. The same mechanism probably op-erates in muscle of IBM patients.
