<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The 26S proteasome system is involved in eliminating various proteins, including ubiquitinated misfolded/ unfolded proteins, and its inhibition results in cellular accumulation of protein aggregates. Intramusclefiber ubiquitinated multiprotein-aggregates are characteristic of sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) muscle fibers. Two major types of aggregates exist, containing either amyloid-␤ (A␤) or phosphorylated tau (p-tau). We have now asked whether abnormalities of the 26S proteasome contribute to s-IBM pathogenesis and whether the multiprotein aggregates have features of aggresomes. Using cultured human muscle fibers we also studied the effect of amyloid-␤ precursor protein (A␤PP) overexpression on proteasome function and the influence of proteasome inhibition on aggresome formation. We report that in s-IBM muscle biopsies 26S proteasome subunits were immunodetected in the ␥-tubulin-associated aggresomes, which also contained A␤ , p-tau , ubiquitin , and HSP70. In addition, a) expression of proteasome subunits was greatly increased, b) the 20S␣ proteasome subunit co-immunoprecipitated with A␤PP/A␤, and c) the three major proteasomal proteolytic activities were reduced. In cultured muscle fibers , A␤PPoverexpressing fibers displayed diminished proteasomal proteolytic activities, and addition of proteasome inhibitor strikingly increased aggresome formation. Accordingly, proteasome dysfunction in s-IBM muscle fibers may play a role in accumulation of mis-folded, potentially cytotoxic proteins and may be induced by increased intracellular A␤PP/A␤.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Muscle Biopsies</head><p>Immunocytochemical studies were performed on 10-mthick transverse sections of fresh-frozen diagnostic muscle biopsies obtained with informed consent from 25 patients with these diagnoses: 10 s-IBM, 3 polymyositis, 1 dermatomyositis, 2 morphologically nonspecific myopathy, 4 peripheral neuropathy, 2 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 3 normal muscle. All IBM biopsies had muscle fibers with vacuoles on Engel trichrome staining, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> and 15-to 21-nm paired helical filaments (PHFs) by SMI-31 immunoreactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and by electron microscopy, and Congo Red positivity using fluorescence enhancement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Light-Microscopic Immunocytochemistry</head><p>Immunocytochemistry was as described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> We used 26 well-characterized monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against 20S and 19S proteasome (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Double immunofluorescence used selected antibodies against 20S and 19S proteasome in combination with one of the following: 1) mouse monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Signet, Dedham, MA), diluted 1:100, which morphologically recognizes A␤ in both AD brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> and s-IBM muscle, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> and on immunoblots it recognizes the A␤ region within the parent A␤PP molecule; 2) mouse monoclonal antibody SMI-31 (Sternberger Monoclonals, Inc., Baltimore, MD), diluted 1:1000, which recognizes p-tau of s-IBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and AD PHFs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> 3) AT100 antibody (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL), diluted 1:1000, which recognizes p-tau of AD PHFs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> Aggresomes were identified by well-characterized mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ␥-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). This was combined with one of the following: 1) mouse monoclonal antibody against ubiquitin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), diluted 1:100; 2) mouse monoclonal antibody 6E10; 3) mouse monoclonal antibody SMI-31; 4) rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal antibodies against 20S and 19S proteasome subunits; and 5) rabbit polyclonal antibody against HSP70 (StressGene, Victoria, British Columbia) diluted 1:200.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunoelectron Microscopy</head><p>Single-and double-label gold immunoelectron microscopy was performed on 10-m unfixed frozen sections adhered to the bottom of 35-mm Petri dishes, as described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> In brief, a primary antibody against the 20S or 19S proteasome subunit was used separately or in combination with each other, and an antibody against 20S proteasome was also combined with antibodies against A␤ or p-tau.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunoblotting</head><p>Muscle biopsies of six s-IBM and six age-matched control patients were immunoblotted, as recently detailed. 6,30 In brief, 10 g of protein were loaded onto 10% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoprobed with antibodies against 19S and 20S proteasome. After incubation in the appropriate secondary antibodies, blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Protein loading was evaluated by the Coomassie blue-stained myosin band. Quantification of immunoreactivity was performed by densitometric analysis using NIH Image J 1.310. One sample, designated as standard, was used on every gel so that band densities on different blots could be normalized to that standard, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> allowing comparison of protein samples on multiple blots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combined Immunoprecipitation/Immunoblot Procedure</head><p>To evaluate whether in s-IBM muscle fibers 20S proteasome physically associates with A␤/A␤PP, a combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblot technique was performed, as we recently described in detail. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> In brief, 100 g of total muscle protein from s-IBM and control biopsies were immunoprecipitated with 5 g of 6E10 antibody, as described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> Immunoprecipitates were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with 20S␣4 subunit proteasome antibody, diluted 1:2000. Subsequently, an appropriate secondary antibody and Western Breeze anti-mouse chemiluminescence kit (Invitrogen) were used. To confirm the specificity of those experiments, the following controls were performed: the 6E10 antibody against A␤PP/A␤, which was used for immunoprecipitation, was omitted, and the 20S␣4 primary antibody used for immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates was omitted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement of Proteasome Activity</head><p>Three main proteasome activities were determined by evaluating the cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> Four s-IBM and four age-matched control muscle biopsies were homogenized in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 mmol/L ethylenediamine tetraace-tic acid, 1 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mmol/L ATP, 20% glycerol, and 0.04% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> centrifuged, the supernatant collected, and protein concentration determined using the Bradford method. Subsequently, 200 g of biopsied muscle protein or 30 g of protein from cultured muscle (see below), were incubated in 100 mol/L fluorogenic substrates for the three different protease activities: Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-AMC (substrate II) for PGPH; Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (substrate III) for CTL; and Z-Ala-Arg-Arg-AMC (substrate VI) for TL activity. Fluorescence emission was excited at 360 nm and recorded at 430 nm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>Statistical analyses were performed by a one-tailed t-test for both the proteasome activity and proteasome protein levels. Significance level was set at P Ͻ 0.05. Data are reported as means Ϯ SEM for all groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultured Human Muscle Fibers</head><p>Tissue cultures of normal human muscle were established from satellite cells of portions of diagnostic muscle biopsies from patients who, after all tests were performed, were considered free of muscle disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> In five experimental culture sets, each established from a differ- ent muscle biopsy, a 3-kb 751 A␤PP-cDNA, in sense or in anti-sense orientation, was transferred into 3-week-old cultured muscle fibers using an adenovirus vector, doses as described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> Three days after the transfer, experimental and control (non-A␤PP-overexpressing) cultures were treated with 1 mol/L epoxomicin (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA), an irreversible proteasome inhibitor, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> and after 24 hours they were processed for light-and electron-microscopic immunocytochemistry, as described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> At the same time, cultures were harvested for measurements of proteasome activity. Selected cultures were also treated, concurrently with epoxomicin, with 1 mol/L of microtubule-disruptor nocodazole (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), which has been shown to disrupt aggresome formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Light-Microscopic Immunocytochemistry</head><p>In all s-IBM muscle biopsies, 70 to 80% of the vacuolated muscle fibers contained, mainly in their nonvacuolated cytoplasm, numerous well-defined, plaque-like, dotty or elongated aggregates immunoreactive with an-tibodies against 20S and 19S proteasome subunits. In addition, in all biopsies, 20 to 30% of the nonvacuolated, otherwise normal-appearing fibers (on a given crosssection) contained similar aggregates (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>; A to F, J, M, P). By double-label immunofluorescence, in all abnormal muscle fibers, aggregates immunoreactive for 20S and 19S proteasome co-localized with each other (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>; D to F) and with A␤ or p-tau immunoreactivity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>; G to R). Both anti-p-tau antibodies used gave the same results. Immunoreactivity with the 26 antibodies directed against various proteasome subunits is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Accumulated aggregates had several features of aggresomes, because 70 to 80% of them were associated with ␥-tubulin and they contained ubiquitin and HSP70, in addition to A␤ and p-tau (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). In contrast to classical aggresomes originally described in mononucleated cells, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> aggresomes in s-IBM muscle fibers did not have perinuclear localization (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; P to S). None of the control non-s-IBM, diseased and normal, human muscle biopsies had muscle fibers containing aggregates immunoreactive with antibodies against 20S, 19S, or ␥-tubulin. Eliminating primary antibodies or replacing them with nonrelevant antibodies resulted in nonstaining. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunoelectron Microscopy</head><p>In s-IBM abnormal muscle fibers, double immunolabeling of both 20S and 19S proteasome revealed that both subunits were associated with the same structures, namely PHFs, 6-to 10-nm amyloid-like fibrils, and floccular material (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3, A and B</ref>). Because both the 20S and 19S proteasome subunits localized to the same structures, electron microscopic double immunolabeling with A␤ and p-tau was performed only with the antibody against 20S. This revealed that 20S was associated with both A␤ on 6-to 10-nm amyloid-like fibrils and floccular material (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>) and p-tau on PHFs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>). In contrast to p-tau, which was localized on PHFs themselves, the proteasome subunits were in small clusters adjacent to PHFs but not directly on them (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>). ␥-Tubulin was associated with PHFs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>), and together with A␤ it was associated with 6-to 10-nm fibrils (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunoblots of Proteasome Subunits</head><p>In s-IBM and normal muscle biopsies, the 20S ␣and ␤-subunits each migrated as either single or double bands of ϳ28 kd, whereas the 19S Rpn10 subunit migrated as a 45-kd band, in the typical positions for each. Expression of subunits 20S␣4, 20S␤1, ␤2 and ␤5, and of 19S Rpn10 was increased in s-IBM muscle biopsies as compared to control biopsies (Figure <ref type="figure">4, A and C</ref>). Omitting the primary antibody resulted in nonstaining (Figure <ref type="figure">4A</ref>).</p><p>In six s-IBM muscle biopsies, densitometry of 20S proteasome subunits ␣4 and ␤2, and of 19S subunit Rpn10, evaluated after normalization to the corresponding myosin band, revealed, as compared to the six agematched control muscle biopsies, that ␣4 was increased 5.6 times (P Ͻ 0.01), ␤2 was increased 5.9 times (P Ͻ 0.01), and 19S was increased 2.4 times (P Ͻ 0.02) (Figure <ref type="figure">4B</ref>). In addition, LMP2 and LMP7, inducible counterpart subunits, respectively, of ␤1 and ␤5, were strongly expressed in s-IBM muscle but were virtually undetectable in control muscle biopsies (Figure <ref type="figure">5C</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunoprecipitation</head><p>Immunoprecipitation of s-IBM and control muscle biopsies with mouse monoclonal 6E10 antibody, which recognizes either A␤ or A␤PP, followed by immunoprobing with a mouse monoclonal antibody against 20S, revealed a very strong 20S proteasome band of 28 kd in s-IBM muscle, but only an extremely weak band in control muscle (Figure <ref type="figure">4D</ref>). Omitting of either the 6E10 antibody used for immunoprecipitation or the primary antibody used for immunoprobing gave negative results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proteasome Activity</head><p>20S proteasome activities were measured in the same s-IBM and normal control muscle biopsies in which immunoblots were performed, and their activities were normalized to the 20S␤2 proteasome protein value measured in each patient. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> In s-IBM biopsies, CTL, TL, and PGPH protease activities were reduced to 29.4% (P Ͻ 0.02), 53.5% (P Ͻ 0.04), and 14.5% (P Ͻ 0.02), respectively, as compared to the control biopsies (Figure <ref type="figure">5A</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultured Muscle Fibers</head></div>

Approximately 20% of the control, non-A␤PP-overexpressing but epoxomicintreated cultured muscle fibers had only very small ␥-tubulin-immunoreactive aggregates (not shown).

Cultured muscle overexpressing antisense A␤PP had no reduction of any proteolytic activity (data not shown). A 24-hour treatment with epoxomicin of non-A␤-overexpressing cultures reduced the CTL activity to 16%, TL to 69.1%, and PGPH to 33.4% (P Ͻ 0.01) of control (Figure <ref type="figure">5B</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study we found significant proteasomal abnormalities in s-IBM muscle fibers as evidenced by: 1) abnormal accumulation of 26S proteasome subunits by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy; 2) increased expression of 26S proteasome subunits by immunoblots; and 3) reduced activities of the three major proteasomal proteolytic enzymes. Previously, in s-IBM muscle biopsies, abnormal proteasomal accumulations were reported, but their relationship to A␤/A␤PP was not studied. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> Our present study strongly suggests that the A␤PP/A␤-proteasome interrelationship may be important in inducing proteasome abnormalities and aggresome formation in s-IBM muscle fibers because: 1) A␤ and proteasome co-localized at the light-microscopy level and were associated ultrastructurally with the same structures; 2) there was a physical association of A␤/A␤PP and proteasome by immunoprecipitation studies; and 3) proteasome activity was inhibited in cultured human muscle fibers overexpressing A␤/A␤PP.</p><p>In s-IBM muscle fibers, increased synthesis of A␤PP 1,2 is associated with its abnormal processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> and with accumulation of its cytotoxic fragment A␤. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Experimental overexpression of A␤PP/A␤ in cultured human muscle fibers was demonstrated to induce in them aspects of the IBM phenotype. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> Accordingly, it was proposed that overproduction of A␤PP/A␤ plays an important role in s-IBM pathogenesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> The inhibition of two major proteasome activities, TL and PGPH, by the overexpressed A␤PP/A␤ that we have demonstrated in the cultured muscle fibers suggests that A␤PP/A␤ may be causatively involved in proteasome inhibition in s-IBM fibers. Other factors present in s-IBM muscle fibers that might contribute to inhibition of proteasome function include: an aging muscle environment (because s-IBM patients are usually age 50 or older), protein over-crowding, oxidative stress, 1,2 and accumulated p-tau, 1,2,4 ␣-synuclein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> and UBB ϩ1 5 , all shown to be capable of inhibiting proteasome activity. <ref type="bibr">8 -13</ref> Abnormal proteasome distribution or its inhibition were suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, Parkinson's disease, Lewy-body dementia, and Huntington disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Immunoblots of 26S proteasome subunits and immunoprecipitation in control and s-IBM muscle biopsies. A: Immunoblots of muscle homogenates of normal control and s-IBM muscle biopsies demonstrate in s-IBM a much stronger expression of Ps 19S, Ps 20S␣4, and Ps 20S␤2 subunits as compared to control muscle biopsies. Omission of primary antibodies resulted in negative reactions. B: Densitometric analysis of the blots in A, performed using NIH Image J 1.310. Protein loading was evaluated by the Coomassie blue-stained myosin band. One sample, designated as standard, was used on every gel so that band densities on different blots could be normalized to this standard. Data are indicated as mean Ϯ SE. Significance was determined by one-tailed unpaired t-test. The level of significance was set at P Ͻ 0.05. C: Immunoblots of the constitutive ␤1 and ␤5, and the inducible LMP2 and LMP7, subunits in control and s-IBM muscle biopsies illustrate increased expression of both ␤1 and ␤5 in s-IBM as compared to controls: LMP2 and LMP7 subunits are present in s-IBM but are not detectable in controls. D: Immunoprecipitations of control and s-IBM biopsies with 6E10 antibody against A␤PP/A␤, followed by immunoprobing with an antibody against 20S␣4 proteasome subunit. A strong band of the appropriate molecular weight corresponding to the 20S␣ proteasome subunit is revealed in s-IBM muscle, whereas the control has only a very weak band (1). Omission of the antibody against 20S␣ (2) or omission of the antibody against A␤PP/A␤ (3) resulted in negative reactions.</p><p>Our demonstrated increase of proteasome-protein subunits may represent the muscle fiber's attempt to deal with multiprotein overcrowding, but, in the presence of the severely impaired proteasomal enzymatic function those attempts are futile and the unfolded/misfolded proteins accumulate in the form of aggregates. Our study also demonstrated that most s-IBM multiprotein aggregates have some features of aggresomes, because they are associated with ␥-tubulin, and contain proteasome subunits, ubiquitin and HSP70. We also induced aggresome-like structures in cultured human muscle fibers by overexpressing A␤PP, ϩ/Ϫ epoxomicin treatment. Previously, aggresomes have been produced only in cultured mononucleated cells, where they appeared as perinuclear inclusions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> However, in our studies, both in the s-IBM biopsied muscle fibers and in the A␤PP-overexpressing cultured muscle fibers, aggresome-like structures were not associated with the nuclei. This might be related to the fact that a muscle fiber is a multinucleated cell and mechanisms responsible for the location of aggresomes might be different from in a mononucleated cell. Our study was not able to demonstrate a protective influence of aggresomes, which was reported in other cell systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> Even though the exact role of aggresomelike structures in s-IBM muscle fibers still needs to be investigated, their presence there, as well as their induction in cultured human muscle fibers by A␤PP overexpression and proteasome inhibition, further support the prominent role of proteasome inhibition, and protein aggregation and misfolding, in the complex cascade of the s-IBM pathogenesis.</p><p>Proteasome is responsible for degradation of most cellular proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> A failure to degrade/remove surplus proteins, including abnormal damaged proteins, would be detrimental to the muscle fiber. Furthermore, accumulated ubiquitinated, misfolded, and oxidized protein aggregates themselves can cause inhibition of proteasome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> Also, the still soluble, early intermediates of protein aggregates, in the form of dimers and trimers, are highly toxic to cells, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> and they can also induce Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Proteasome enzymatic activities in control and s-IBM muscle biopsies (A), and in cultured control and A␤PP-overexpressing (A␤PPϩ), and in not-A␤PP-overexpressing but epoxomicin-treated human muscle fibers (B). A: Proteasome TL, CTL, and PGPH activities were measured in four s-IBM and four normal control muscle biopsies and results were normalized to proteasome quantity in the same muscle biopsies. All three proteasome activities are significantly reduced in s-IBM muscle biopsies, CTL to 29.4% (P Ͻ 0.02), TL to 53.5% (P Ͻ 0.04), and PGPH to 14.5% (P Ͻ 0.02) of control muscle biopsies. Data are indicated as mean Ϯ SE. Significance was determined by the one-tailed unpaired t-test. The level of significance was set at P Ͻ 0.05. B: TL, CTL, and PGPH activities were measured in five sets of normal cultured human muscle fibers having A␤PP-overexpression (A␤PPϩ), in their not-A␤PP-overexpressing cultured sister controls, and in not-A␤PPϩ epoxomicin-treated cultures. The results were normalized to proteasome quantity. In A␤PPϩ cultures, TL and PGPH activities are reduced to 55.8% and to 85.4% of controls, respectively, with no significant change in CTL. Data are indicated as mean Ϯ SE. Epoxomicin treatment reduced CTL, TL, and PGPH to 16.0%, 69.1%, and 33.4% of controls, respectively. proteasome inhibition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Because proteasome inhibition might, in turn, contribute to the formation of soluble toxic protein oligomers, in a vicious circle, proteasome inhibition may be detrimental to the cells even before protein aggregates can be identified morphologically.</p><p>In addition to the formation of multiprotein aggregates, proteasome abnormalities might play another role in the s-IBM pathogenesis, namely the cytotoxic T-cell inflammation. Some s-IBM muscle fibers express MHC-I, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> which probably plays a role in the CD8ϩ cytotoxic T-cell response <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> by enabling a muscle fiber to become antigen-presenting. Proteasomal inducible ␤-subunits, LMP2 and LMP7, which we have shown increased in s-IBM muscle fibers, are involved in the intracellular processing of peptides for MHC-I expression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> Possibly, in s-IBM muscle fibers LMP2 and LMP7 are involved in antigen presentation development of the T-cell inflammatory response.</p><p>In summary, our present study demonstrates proteasome dysfunction in s-IBM muscle fibers, and it suggests that A␤/A␤PP may promote that dysfunction. Our studies raise the possibility of novel therapeutic manipulations to correct that proteasomal malfunction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
