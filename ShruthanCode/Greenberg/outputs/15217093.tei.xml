<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Possible pathogenic mechanisms of sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM) include abnormal production and accumulation of amyloid ␤ (A␤), muscle aging, and increased oxidative stress. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), an endocrine and autocrine/paracrine trophic factor, provides resistance against A␤ toxicity and oxidative stress in vitro and promotes cell survival. In this study we analyzed the IGF-I signaling pathway in sIBM muscle and found that 16.2% Ϯ 2.5% of nonregenerating fibers showed increased expression of IGF-I, phosphatidylinositide 3ЈOH-kinase, and Akt. In the majority of sIBM abnormal muscle fibers, increased IGF-I mRNA and protein correlated with the presence of A␤ cytoplasmic inclusions. To investigate a possible relationship between A␤ toxicity and IGF-I upregulation, normal primary muscle cultures were stimulated for 24 hours with the A␤(25-35) peptide corresponding to the biologically active domain of A␤. This induced an increase of IGF-I mRNA and protein in myotubes at 6 hours, followed by a gradual reduction thereafter. The level of phosphorylated Akt showed similar changes. We suggest that in sIBM, IGF-I overexpression represents a reactive response to A␤ toxicity, possibly providing trophic support to vulnerable fibers. Understanding the signaling pathways activated by IGF-I in sIBM may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for the disease.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM) is the most frequent acquired neuromuscular disorder occurring in patients over age 50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>. Although numerous lines of evidence argue in favor of an immuno-mediated pathogenic mechanism (i.e. presence of endomysial inflammation with increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines), sIBM patients respond poorly to immunosuppressive treatments and have a steadily worsening clinical course that leads to severe disability <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. In addition, sIBM muscle is characterized by a unique array of pathologic features, including i) muscle fibers with ''rimmed'' vacuoles, ii) the presence of 15-to 20-nm filaments (mainly composed of hyperphosphorylated tau) and amyloid ␤ (A␤)-containing inclusions within the muscle fibers, and iii) the abnormal accumulation of proteins commonly observed in Alzheimer disease (AD) brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>. The etiology of sIBM is largely unknown but it has been proposed that abnormal production and accumulation of A␤, muscle aging and increased oxidative stress may have a key pathogenic role <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. The forced overexpression of A␤ precursor protein (A␤PP) in both cultured myotubes and in muscle from animal models produces cellular abnormalities similar to those observed in sIBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. This suggests that an abnormal A␤PP metabolism triggers a cascade of cellular events (i.e. increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial malfunction, and abnormal protein processing and aggregation) that possibly contributes to muscle fiber degeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</p><p>Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a pleiotropic growth factor with both endocrine and autocrine/paracrine functions. It belongs to a family of structurally and functionally related polypeptides, including insulin and IGF-II, and has a broad spectrum of actions in both central and peripheral nervous systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>. In skeletal muscle, IGF-I plays a key role in the plastic adaptation following increased stretch and contraction and in the course of muscle fiber regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. In animal models, the muscle-targeted overexpression of IGF-I promotes hypertrophy and sustains the regeneration potential of aged muscle after injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, several studies have focused on the possible involvement of IGF-I in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, Huntington disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, and a potential therapeutic use of IGF-I has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>. In vitro experiments have shown that IGF-I has a protective role against A␤ toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, provides resistance in conditions of increased oxidative stress, and promotes neuronal cell survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. Similar to other growth factors, IGF-I mediates cell survival mainly through the activation of the phosphatidylinositide 3ЈOH-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. The recruitment of PI3K, following the binding of IGF-I with its receptors, results in phosphorylation of inositol lipids. These operate as second messengers activating the serine-threonine kinase Akt   with subsequent increased expression of pro-survival factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</p><p>These observations provide the rationale to investigate a possible involvement of the IGF-I signaling system in the pathophysiology of sIBM muscle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p>Muscle biopsies from 7 patients with clinical features indicative of sIBM (i.e. age of onset over 50 years, muscle weakness in both proximal and distal compartments of 4 limbs, thinning of the forearm muscles, and prominent involvement of the quadriceps) were included in this study. All specimens showed typical sIBM morphological characteristics, including the presence of i) inflammatory cells often invading non-necrotic fibers, ii) muscle fibers with rimmed vacuoles, iii) Congo-red-positive deposits within the muscle fibers, iv) SMI 31-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions, and v) 15-to 20-nm cytoplasmic tubulofilamentous inclusions by electron microscopy analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>. Controls were polymyositis (n ϭ 5), dermatomyositis (n ϭ 5), peripheral neuropathies (n ϭ 4), ALS (n ϭ 4), spinal muscular atrophy (n ϭ 4), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (n ϭ 3), Becker muscular dystrophy (n ϭ 3), and normal muscles (n ϭ 4). All muscle samples were obtained for diagnostic purposes with informed consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunocytochemistry on Muscle Biopsies</head><p>Immunocytochemistry was performed on 8-m-thick unfixed cryostat sections using standard protocols. The following primary antibodies were used: i) monoclonal anti-IGF-I (clone Sm1.2, Celltech, Italy), diluted 1/100; ii) polyclonal anti-PI3K subunit p110 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1/50; iii) polyclonal anti-Akt1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted 1/50; iv) monoclonal anti-developmental myosin (YLEM, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK), diluted 1/100; v) monoclonal anti-SMI 31 (Sternberger Monoclonals, Lutherville, MD) diluted 1/1,000; and vi) monoclonal anti-A␤ (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA), recognizing residues 1-16 of the protein, diluted 1/100. The reaction with all primary antibodies was performed for 16 to 18 hours at 4ЊC in a humid chamber, followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antisera. For quantitative analysis, the relative amount of immunopositive fibers was evaluated in at least 500 muscle fibers from 4 representative microscopic fields of each experimental section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Human IGF-I cDNA and 35 S-Labeled cRNA Synthesis</head><p>The human IGF-I cDNA was generated by PCR from total human cDNA using the following primers: forward 5Ј-TGC TCT CAA CAT CTC CCA TCT CTC-3Ј; reverse 5Ј-CAG CCC GAG TTG TGT AGA AAG AAG-3Ј (Genbank accession number M27544). The 999 base pair PCR product was cloned into the pPCR-script plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sense and antisense 35 S-labeled cRNA probes were then generated using the Riboprobe In Vitro Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In Situ Hybridization</head><p>In situ hybridization was performed in 8-m-thick cryostat sections according to previously published protocols (24) using sense or antisense 35 S-labeled IGF-I cRNA probes at the final activity of 800,000 cpm/l. After being coated with NBT-2 photographic emulsion (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY), the slides were kept at 4ЊC in the dark and developed after 4 to 7 weeks.</p></div>

Total cDNAs were used for semiquantitative PCR analysis of IGF-I transcript with the pair of primers described above. The housekeeping gene Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) was also amplified and used as internal control. For quantitative real-time PCR each reaction mixture contained 1/20 of the reverse transcription reaction volume, 10 pmol of forward and reverse primers, 5 pmol of Taqman probe (IGF-1 probe:TAMRA/FAM, GAPD probe: BHQ2/TR) and 1 ϫ IQ Supermix PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Primers and probes were designed using the Beacon Designer software (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA). The following oligonucleotides were used: IGF-I forward primer 5Ј-ATC TCT TCT ACC TGG CGC TGT-3Ј; IGF-I reverse primer 5Ј-CCT GTC TCC ACA CAC GAA CTG-3Ј; IGF-I Taqman probe 5Ј-FAM-CAC CTT CAC CAG CTC TGC CAC GGC-TAMRA; GAPD forward primer 5Ј-GGA CCT GAC CTG CCG TCT AG-3Ј; GAPD reverse primer 5Ј-GTG TAG CCC AGG ATG CCC TTG-3Ј; GAPD Taqman probe 5Ј-TR-CCT CCG ACG CCT GCT TCA CCA CCT-BHQ2. Each reaction mixture was made in triplicate and incubated in an iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). PCR conditions consisted of an initial melt at 95ЊC for 10 min, followed by 60 cycles of 95ЊC for 15 s, and 60ЊC for 1 min. Standard curves were generated for both GAPD and IGF-I by serial dilutions of muscle culture cDNA and both PCR efficiencies were estimated to be close to 100%. Changes of IGF-I expression levels were determined relatively to GAPD by the ⌬⌬Ct method ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) with IGF-I threshold cycle (Ct) ranging from 29 to 33 cycles.</p></div>

Fifty g of proteins were loaded in each well of a 12% polyacrylamide gel, separated by electrophoresis, and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Relliehausen, Germany) using standard protocols. Blots were incubated overnight using one of the following antibodies: i) monoclonal anti-IGF-I (Biosource International) diluted 1/200; ii) polyclonal anti-Akt1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1/200; and iii) polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt Thr-308  (p-Akt Thr-308 , Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA), recognizing the active form of Akt that is phosphorylated at Threonine 308 and Serine 473 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, diluted 1/500. After being incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, blots were developed using the ECL Western Blotting Analysis System (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). For quantitative study, each blot was then re-probed with a monoclonal anti-muscle specific Actin antibody (YLEM) diluted 1/ 2,000. Densitometry on autoradiographic films was carried out using the TotalLab 2.01 software (Nonlinear Dynamics Ltd., Newcastle upon Tyne, UK).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunocytochemistry on Muscle Cultures</head><p>Muscle cultures were grown on glass coverslips placed on the bottom of Petri dishes. At each time point during treatment with A␤ peptides, coverslips were collected from the culture dish. This allowed evaluating changes in the expression of IGF-I protein in the same culture at different moments during the experimental procedure. Cultures were incubated with the monoclonal anti-IGF-I antibody (Clone sm1.2, Celltech) diluted 1/20 overnight at 4ЊC. Detection of immunocomplexes was performed using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences).

These included both vacuolated (48.4% Ϯ 5.1% of vacuolated muscle fibers had increased immunoreactivity for IGF-I) and nonvacuolated muscle fibers. On serial sections, 60% to 70% of nonregenerating muscle fibers with increased IGF-I expression showed the presence of typical A␤-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H-K</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>In recent years, a growing body of evidence has pointed out a potential role of IGF-I signaling in the pathogenic scenario of various neurodegenerative disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. For example, hippocampal neurons in AD show increased expression of IGF-I (15), and it has been demonstrated in a mouse model of the disease that this growth factor has a direct role in reducing the burden of A␤ from the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. A possible derangement in IGF-I signaling has also been found in the spinal cord of patients affected by ALS, a disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of ventral horn motor neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Despite the fact that IGF-I plays a key role in many aspects of muscle physiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, little information is available about its possible involvement in the pathogenic mechanisms of human primary muscle disorders.</p><p>In the present study, using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization, we showed increased IGF-I expression in regenerating muscle fibers in all myopathies. This is in agreement with previous reports showing a role of IGF-I throughout the entire process of muscle repair and regeneration, from the recruitment of quiescent satellite cells within the basal lamina to the maturation of new multinucleated myofibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>.</p><p>We found IGF-I protein overexpression in a considerable amount (16.2% Ϯ 2.5%) of nonregenerating fibers in muscle biopsies from 7 sIBM patients. The majority of these fibers also showed upregulation of IGF-I mRNA, suggesting that IGF-I overexpression was mainly due to increased transcription, mRNA stabilization, or both. In addition, the same fibers also displayed increased expression of the other members of the IGF-I signaling system (PI3K and Akt), suggesting that within sIBM abnormal muscle fibers, IGF-I acts mainly through an autocrine mechanism. It appears that the activation of the IGF-I signaling system in sIBM is not simply consequent to nonspecific myopathic abnormalities or to inflammation as in all muscular dystrophies (which showed the highest degree of myopathic changes), and in polymyositis (which has in common with sIBM the presence of CD8ϩ invading T-cells and an increased expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>) IGF-I upregulation was restricted to regenerating muscle fibers. The possibility exists that in sIBM nonregenerating abnormal muscle fibers, IGF-I upregulation may be secondary to the increased production and accumulation of A␤, as suggested by the evidence that muscle fibers bearing A␤-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions also presented increased IGF-I mRNA and protein. The experimental results of our in vitro model appear to support this hypothesis. In fact, in cultured myotubes, treatment with the A␤ <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> peptide resulted in upregulation of both IGF-I mRNA and protein at 6 hours, with a gradual reduction thereafter. The simultaneous increased phosphorylation of Akt in our model was probably triggered by IGF-I through the activation of an autocrine signaling pathway. It does not appear that this profile of IGF-I expression is specific to our in vitro cell system, as similar results have been reported in vascular smooth muscle cells using different stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. The mechanisms leading to increased IGF-I in sIBM and in myotubes treated with the A␤ peptide are not known, but oxidative stress may play an important role. The presence of numerous markers of increased oxidative stress has been demonstrated in sIBM abnormal muscle fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. In vitro, treatment of cultured myotubes with the A␤ peptide results in increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and production of the free radical nitric oxide, a short-lived gas known to promote the formation of highly reactive oxidizing molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>. Moreover, reactive oxygen species are able to stimulate the synthesis of IGF-I mRNA and protein in vascular smooth muscle cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</p><p>We are aware of the fact that our in vitro model raises the question of a possible pathogenic role of extracellular A␤. In sIBM the majority of A␤ deposits are within the muscle fibers. However, it has been shown that in highly degenerated sIBM fibers, A␤ deposits may reach the extracellular space possibly through breaks in the plasma membrane. Moreover, by immuno-electronmicroscopy, A␤-immunoreactive material has been detected also outside the muscle fibers in association with collagen fibrils <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. Similar to A␤PP-transfected myotubes that release an increased amount of A␤ molecules in the culture medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>, in vivo muscle fibers overexpressing A␤PP could also generate an extracellular pool of A␤. Therefore, the possibility that in sIBM an additional toxic effect derives from extracellular A␤ cannot be excluded.</p><p>We also found increased IGF-I expression in a minority of nonregenerating muscle fibers (3.2% Ϯ 2.3%) in dermatomyositis biopsies. In dermatomyositis muscle, the deposition within the microvascular bed of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex of complement suggests the presence of a complement-mediated pathogenic mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>. The C5b-9 membrane attack complex is able to induce increased expression of IGF-I and upregulates IGF-I binding sites in vascular smooth muscle cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>, and therefore it is possible that such mechanisms is responsible for the overexpression of IGF-I in a subpopulation of nonregenerating muscle fibers in dermatomyositis. However, additional studies are needed to verify whether this and/or other dermatomyositis-specific pathogenic mechanisms may contribute to IGF-I overexpression.</p><p>In sIBM it is possible that IGF-I induces a cascade of molecular events in the attempt to restore cellular homeostasis in vulnerable fibers. This effect may be mediated by different mechanisms, including i) activation of signaling pathways known to promote cell survival, ii) reduction of tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and iii) modulation of the immune response.</p><p>We found that IGF-I upregulation was accompanied by an increased expression of PI3K and Akt, indicating the activation of a signaling pathway known to promote cell survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref>. This may happen in part through the activation of the nuclear factor-B (NF-B) and members of the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. Indeed, both NF-B ad members of the MAPKs family have been found upregulated in sIBM muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>.</p><p>In cultured neurons it has been demonstrated that the IGF-I-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway regulates phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau through the inhibition of glycogen-synthase kinase 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>. In sIBM muscle the characteristic SMI-31-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions are mainly composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein abnormally aggregated into paired helical filaments (PHFs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>. Therefore, it is possible that increased IGF-I represents an attempt of the muscle fibers to counteract the formation of PHFs by reducing the abnormal phosphorylation of tau.</p><p>Finally, IGF-I overexpression may also be relevant in other aspects of sIBM pathology. In fact, IGF-I is able to mediate both T lymphocyte growth and chemotaxis (as these cells bear functional IGF-I receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>) and to promote the production of superoxide anion and pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. IGF-I could therefore also contribute to the modulation of the immune response in sIBM muscle by improving host defense against a yet unknown putative antigen <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>.</p><p>We can only speculate on the reasons why in sIBM muscle fiber degeneration steadily progresses in spite of the activation of IGF-I-mediated cellular defense mechanisms. It is possible that such response is unable to counterbalance the pathogenic mechanisms taking place in sIBM muscle for 2 reasons: i) the impairment of other intracellular signaling systems within sIBM abnormal muscle fibers, as previously proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>, may render a putative protective function of IGF-I less effective, or ii) a parallel increased expression of IGF-I binding proteins, probably promoted by the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-␣ and interleukin-1␤ <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>, results in reduced levels of free and metabolically active IGF-I. However, additional studies are necessary to further clarify this issue. Nevertheless, understanding the molecular signaling pathways activated by IGF-I in sIBM muscle may open the way to possible novel therapeutic strategies for this disease.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
