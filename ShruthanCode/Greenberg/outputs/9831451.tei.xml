<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>␤-amyloid precursor protein (␤APP) is a cell-surface glycoprotein containing a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminus domain (reviewed in Ref. 1). The ␤APP gene produces at least three alternatively spliced transcripts encoding ␤APP containing 695, 751 and 770 amino acids; the last two have in their extracellular region a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> 695-␤APP is present in neurons, while 751-and 770-␤APP, but not 695-␤APP, are present in other tissues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Biological functions of ␤APP are still not well understood, but it has been proposed to play a role in mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, maintenance of cell integrity and shape, and neurite growth (reviewed in Refs 1,2).</p><p>␤APP and its epitope ␤-amyloid protein (A␤) a 39-43 residue polypeptide, are considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) and hereditary inclusion-body myopathies (h-IBMs) are the only human diseases in which pathological accumulation of ␤APP, including the A␤ epitope, and increases of ␤APP-751 mRNA have been identified outside the brain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> In s-and h-IBM, ␤APP and its mRNA accumulate in vacuolated muscle fibers, and precede other identified abnormalities (reviewed in Ref. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</p><p>s-IBM is the most common progressive muscle disease beginning in patients age 50 and older. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> h-IBM encompasses several autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive syndromes manifesting progressive muscle weakness beginning in the second or third decade. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> The abnormal genes are not known, but one autosomal recessive form is linked to chromosome 9p1-q1 (reviewed in Ref. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). In addition to abnormal accumulation of ␤APP, s-and h-IBM vacuolated muscle fibers contain abnormal accumulations of several other proteins characteristic of AD brain, as well as congophilic amyloid. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>Muscle cultures: Human muscle was aneurally cultured in monolayer from satellite cells in portions of diagnostic muscle biopsies (obtained with informed consent), according to our previously described method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Muscle cultured from patients who were considered free of muscle disease after all diagnostic studies served as controls. h-IBM muscle cultures were established from biopsies of five Iranian-Jewish patients (ages 36-59 years) with quadriceps-sparing autosomal-recessive inclusion-body myopathy; in all of them linkage to chromosome 9p1-q1 was established, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and all had the characteristic h-IBM features in their muscle biopsies (reviewed in Ref. 7). Five different control culture sets (each from a different biopsy of patients aged-matched or older than the h-IBM patients) served as controls for five h-IBM culture sets.</p><p>Innervation: Four to five days after myoblast fusion, explants of whole transverse slices of 12-to 14-day-old rat embryo spinal cord with dorsal root ganglia attached were placed on the muscle monolayer cultures, four fragments per petri dish, as described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> Living cultures were observed every other day by phase-contrast microscopy and their contractions were video monitored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>␤APP-gene transfer:</head><p>In eight additional sets of control cultures, each from a different normal muscle biopsy, a 3-Kb human 751-␤APP-cDNA was transferred into the aneurally cultured myotubes immediately after myoblast fusion, using a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus (RDRA) vector at 0.3 × 10 8 pfu/ml culture medium. RDRA-␤APP construction and methods of transfer of the ␤APP gene into cultured human muscle were as detailed elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> In our previous studies, this dose of transferred ␤APP-cDNA did not induce morphological abnormalities in cultured human muscle until 5-6 weeks after the transfer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Three days after ␤APP-gene transfer, ␤APP-over-expressing and sister control-muscle cultures were co-cultured with fetal rat spinal cord, as above.</p><p>Immunostaining of ␤APP-epitopes: Immunofluorescence studies on aneurally cultured muscle fibers were performed as described, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> using the following well-characterized rabbit antibodies directed against ␤APP epitopes: (a) R37, against C-terminal sequence 681-695 of ␤APP (C-␤APP), <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> diluted 1:200, (b) T97, against N-terminal sequence 18-38 of ␤APP (N-␤APP), <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> diluted 1:200, and (c) R1282, against A␤ sequence 1-40, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> diluted 1:500.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>␤APP epitopes in aneurally cultured muscle fibers:</head><p>In cultured h-IBM muscle, ␤APP epitopes were accumulated by 2-4 days after myoblast fusion (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B-D</ref>). Cultured normal muscle into which the ␤APP gene was transferred had significantly increased ␤APP immunoreactivity 2 days after transfer (Fig. <ref type="figure">1F-H</ref>). As in our previous studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> there was no immunoreactivity of ␤APP epitopes in unaltered control cultured human muscle fibers (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A,E</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Innervation of cultured human muscle fibers:</head><p>Control Muscle: As in our previous studies, 12,14 2-3 days after co-culturing spinal-cord explants with the muscle cultures, long neurites were emerging from the spinal cord explants and ending on muscle fibers. Four to six days after co-culturing with the spinalcord, individual muscle fibers began contracting. Two weeks after co-culture, large areas of muscle fibers (70-90% of the culture) continued to contract and were entirely cross-striated (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). AChR clusters and AChE-positive patches were present only at the neuromuscular contacts (Fig. <ref type="figure">2D,G</ref>), being on 70-90% of the muscle fibers. Continuously contracting innervated muscle fibers could be maintained for up to 5 months. By contrast, human muscle fibers cultured aneurally do not contract, have only patchy cross-striations, and only very slight and diffusely distributed AChRs and AChE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> In contrast to innervated control muscle cultures, 80-90% of h-IBM muscle fibers co-cultured with spinal cord explants did not become cross-striated, and they were either not contracting or had very slow and irregular contractions. Neurites emerging from the spinal cord explants did not end of the muscle fibers, but were trespassing them (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>). AChRs were diffusely distributed (Fig. <ref type="figure">2E</ref>), and only 10-15% of the fibers had AChR clusters. AChE was distributed along the muscle membrane in a thin line and moderately in the cytoplasm (Fig. <ref type="figure">2H</ref>). Between 3 and 4 weeks after co-culture, most of the muscle fibers became vacuolated, and they could not be maintained longer than 5-6 weeks after co-culture.</p><p>Similarly to h-IBM muscle, virtually all the ␤APPover-expressing muscle fibers co-cultured with spinal cord explants were not cross-striated and were not contracting. Neurites outgrowing from the spinal cord explants were trespassing muscle fibers (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). AChRs were present diffusely (Fig. <ref type="figure">2F</ref>), and only 2-3% of the fibers had AChR clusters. AChE was present along the membrane in a thin line or diffusely in the cytoplasm (Fig. <ref type="figure">2I</ref>). At 3-4 weeks after co-culture, most of the muscle fibers were vacuolated, and they could not be maintained longer than 5-6 weeks. The impaired innervation was not due to an effect on spinal cord neurons of ␤APP fragments released to the medium because treatment of control co-cultures with conditioned medium obtained from ␤APP-over-expressing cultures did not influence innervation. Impaired innervation was not due to the effect of the adenovirus vector itself because transfer of muscle glycogenphosphorylase gene via the same adenovirus vector actually had a beneficial influence on muscle innervation. 17</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that cultured normal human muscle experimentally overexpressing ␤APP, and cultured h-IBM muscle, do not become properly innervated. In addition, cultured h-IBM muscle fibers show increased accumulation of ␤APP epitopes. We presume that in cultured h-IBM muscle fibers it is the genetic defect that directly or indirectly causes their increased accumulation of ␤APP. We postulate that in both types of cultured muscle fibers the impairment of innervation is due to their increased ␤APP, since this is the only abnormal component presently known that cultured h-IBM and muscle carrying the ␤APP gene have in common. We conclude that the impairment of innervation is due to the intracellular over-expression of ␤APP (the whole molecule or epitopes thereof), because treatment of cultures with conditioned medium containing large amounts of A␤1-40 and A␤1-42 (Xia, McFerrin,Engel, Selkoe and Askanas, 1997, unpublished), and possibly other soluble ␤APP epitopes did not influence innervation.</p><p>Studies by others have demonstrated that increased intracellular levels of ␤APP promote neurite growth in co-cultures established between ␤APP-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and embryonic rat hippocampal neurons, whereas treatment of cultures with a conditioned medium containing soluble (s) domains of ␤APP (s-␤APP) and A␤ did not induce that effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> In the brain, ␤APP has been proposed to function as a cell-surface receptor capable of interacting with G-proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Co-localization of ␤APP with ␤1 integrin, and ␤APP binding to the neuritepromoting site of laminin, have also been demonstrated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Both integrin and laminin are components of the extracellular matrix of many cells types, including muscle. Whether these mechanisms can influence neurites to trespass, rather than end on and form junctions at the muscle fibers containing excessive ␤APP is not known. In h-IBM and after ␤APP-gene transfer, increased immunoreactivity with all three ␤APP epitopes is expressed in the form of strongly immunoreactive patches or dots, while control is negative. ×1100.

We have previously termed an inability of a muscle fiber to become innervated and/or maintain the full influence of the innervating axon a 'myogenous dysreception to innervation', and we hypothesized that this mechanism can play a role in the pathogenesis of some muscle disorders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> We now propose that this "myogenous dysinnervation" mechanism might be a component of the demonstrated denervation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> of muscle fibers in s-and h-IBM patients. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Vol 9 FIG. 1 .</head><label>91</label><figDesc>FIG.1.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>TO investigate whether abnormally accumulated ␤APP may be responsible for denervation of muscle fibers that are present in hereditary inclusion-body myopathy (h-IBM) and sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM), we cultured five h-IBM and eight normal muscle biop- sies. In eight other experiments, a 3 kb human 751- ␤APP-cDNA was transferred, using adenovirus vector, into cultured normal myotubes immediately after myoblast fusion. In all experiments, cultured muscle fibers were co-cultured with fetal rat spinal cord. Controls had no detectable ␤APP epitopes, whereas ␤APP epitopes were greatly increased in cultured h-IBM muscle and in cultured normal muscle after ␤APP-gene transfer. Innervated normal cultured muscle fibers were continuously contracting and fully cross-striated, and they had acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and acetyl- cholinesterase (AChE) accumulated only at the neuro- muscular junctions (NMJs). By contrast, both groups of ␤APP-overexpressing cultured muscle fibers were not contracting and not cross-striated; and did not have NJMs containing AChRs and AChE. Our results suggest that over-expression of ␤APP in cultured muscle fibers inhibits their innervation, and that the accumu- lation of ␤APP in muscle fibers of both h-and s-IBM patients may be responsible for their not becoming or remaining properly innervated or reinnervated, i.e. a 'myogenous-dysinnervation' mechanism.
