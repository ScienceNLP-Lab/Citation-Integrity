<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) is a slowly progressive inflammatory myopathy which occurs most often in men over the age of 50 years. Diagnosis of s-IBM is based on typical clinical and histological findings. Weakness and atrophy affect both proximal and distal muscle groups with a characteristic early involvement of the quadriceps and deep finger flexors <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dalakas, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Griggs et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sekul et al., 1997)</ref>. Inflammatory infiltrates, partial invasion of nonnecrotic fibres, rimmed vacuoles, amyloid deposits and 15-18-nm tubulofilaments are found in muscle biopsy specimens © Oxford University Press 1998 increased signal intensity in the calf muscle of all patients except one. The involvement of calf muscle was confirmed by 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy of resting muscle, which disclosed abnormalities in metabolite ratios in all patients. However, muscle oxidative metabolism assessed during recovery from exercise was normal in patients with s-IBM, as maximum rates of mitochondrial ATP production and post-exercise ADP recovery rates were within the normal range in all cases. We conclude that muscle mitochondrial abnormalities are a secondary process and unlikely to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of s-IBM. <ref type="bibr">(Griggs et al., 1995)</ref>. Despite the well-defined clinical and pathological features, the aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease are still unknown.</p><p>Besides the typical pathological changes, ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carpenter et al., 1978)</ref> and ragged red fibres are frequently reported in muscle of patients with s-IBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carpenter and Karpati, 1984)</ref>. Two recent studies showed that cytochrome c oxidase deficient fibres and ragged red fibres are associated with multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the skeletal muscle of s-IBM patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Oldfors et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Santorelli et al., 1996)</ref>. Mitochondrial changes are also reported in polymyositis and dermatomyositis <ref type="bibr">(Rifai et al., 1995)</ref> but the degree of abnormality is lower than in s-IBM and such changes are regarded as an unusual finding in both conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Watkins and Cullen, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">Griggs et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rifai et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blume et al., 1997)</ref>. Although cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibres and ragged red fibres are typical findings in patients with mitochondrial myopathies, due to defects of mtDNA <ref type="bibr">(DiMauro and Moraes, 1993)</ref>, it is not clear whether a defect of oxidative metabolism plays a role in the pathogenesis of s-IBM and is involved in the progressive skeletal muscle degeneration. Mitochondrial abnormalities and mtDNA deletions are not present in all s-IBM patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Santorelli et al., 1996)</ref> and clinical features in s-IBM differ from those described in patients with primary mitochondrial disorders due to multiple mtDNA deletions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Zeviani et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hirano et al., 1994)</ref>. Moreover, ragged red fibres <ref type="bibr">(Rifai et al., 1995)</ref>, cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibres <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Muller-Hocker, 1990</ref>) and mtDNA deletions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Simonetti et al., 1992)</ref> accumulate with age even in normal subjects. Skeletal muscle energy metabolism can be conveniently assessed in vivo using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31 P-MRS). By means of 31 P-MRS, defects of mitochondrial respiration have been demonstrated in skeletal muscle of patients with primary mitochondrial disorders in the absence of any symptoms or signs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Taylor et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lodi et al., 1997c)</ref> and even of morphological or in vitro biochemical abnormalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cortelli et al., 1991)</ref>.</p><p>In the present study we used 31 P-MRS to establish whether an in vivo deficit of skeletal muscle mitochondrial function is an underlying feature of s-IBM and, thus, whether it might play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients and methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p>We studied 12 s-IBM patients [nine men and three women, aged 58 Ϯ 11 years ( mean Ϯ SD)] with a mean age at disease onset of 50 Ϯ 13 years (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Diagnosis was made of definite s-IBM in all cases, on the basis of clinical presentation and histological examination of muscle biopsy specimens from quadriceps or deltoid muscles, according to recently published diagnostic criteria <ref type="bibr">(Griggs et al., 1995)</ref>. Sensory and motor nerve conduction studies were normal in all patients. Electromyography showed myopathic changes in all cases. An increased number of polyphasic long-duration and high-amplitude motor unit potentials, which are likely to be due to local primary muscle changes rather than to reinnervation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Luciano and Dalakas, 1997)</ref>, were detected in Patients 2 and 4. Serial frozen sections of muscle were analysed inter alia using modified Gomori-trichrome stain to look for ragged red fibres and using succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase stains to assess mitochondrial enzyme activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>mtDNA analysis</head><p>Muscle biopsies, stored at -70°C, were quickly transferred to Dounce homogenizers pre-cooled with liquid N 2 . Further liquid N 2 was added and the muscle ground to a fine powder. Between 0.5 and 2.0 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 25 mM Na EDTA, pH 8.0; and 10 mM NaCl), depending on the size of the sample, plus proteinase K and SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate) to final concentrations of 2 mg/ml and 1% w/v, respectively, were then added. The muscle suspensions were incubated overnight at 55°C, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction. DNA was precipitated from the aqueous layer by addition of twice the volume of ice cold ethanol plus one-tenth volume of 3 M sodium acetate at pH 5.5. The DNA was resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA at pH 8.0. The extracted DNA was analysed for the presence of major mitochondrial rearrangements, essentially by the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Li et al. (1995)</ref>. However, the Perkin Elmer XL polymerase chain reactions (PCR) kit used by the authors was replaced with reagents purchased from Bioline UK and the cycling profile was simplified.

PCRs were carried out in a Perkin Elmer Geneamp 2400 thermal cycler and were hotstarted at 80°C by the addition of 20-50 ng DNA and denatured at 95°C for 1.5 min before cycling at 94°C for 10 s, and 68°C for 10 min plus 30 s for each subsequent cycle (25 cycles in total). PCR products (5-10 µl) were separated on 0.7% Seakem gels (FMC Bioproducts, Maine, USA).</p></div>

Spectra were acquired using a 2-s inter-pulse delay at rest (64 scans), and during exercise (32 scans) and recovery. As soon as the last 32-scan exercise spectrum was collected, an additional eight scan spectrum was also recorded, to be considered 'zero time' for the recovery phase, and the exercise was stopped immediately afterwards. Data were collected for 10 min during recovery (four eight-scan spectra followed by four of 16 scans, three of 32 scans and two of 64 scans). The muscle was exercised by plantar flexion at 0.5 Hz, lifting a weight of 10% of lean body mass [calculated from body weight and skin-fold thickness <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Durnin and Womersley, 1974)</ref>] through a distance of 7 cm.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Ragged red fibres and/or cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibres were demonstrated in muscle biopsy specimens of 67% (n ϭ 8) of s-IBM patients, and multiple mtDNA deletions were detected by a PCR-based method in muscle tissue of 11 of the 12 patients (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> shows a T 1 -weighted leg image from Patient 8 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> that from a sex-and age-matched control subject. In the patient's image, the mild signal intensity increase of soleus and lateral gastrocnemius muscle is associated with a severe signal intensity increase in the medial gastrocnemius. Signal hyperintensity on T 1 -weighted images in muscles of s-IBM patients has been shown to be due mainly to replacement of degenerated muscle fibres with fat <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Reimers et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sekul et al., 1997)</ref>, but oedema-like abnormalities may also contribute to it <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Reimers et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sekul et al., 1997)</ref>. In all cases but Patient 3, MRI disclosed variable degrees of signal hyperintensity in calf muscle (Calf Muscle Score range ϭ 1-8 for the patients). The Calf Muscle Score was zero in all control subjects.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows typical resting calf muscle spectra from a patient (Patient 8 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>) and from a sex-and agematched control subject (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). In the patient, the PCr peak is decreased and P i peak is increased (relative to the β-ATP peak). Lower signal-to-noise in the patient's spectrum is due to the lower muscle fibre content in the volume of tissue investigated by the coil. Data from resting muscle are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. In s-IBM patients, the PCr to ATP and P i to ATP ratios were significantly reduced and increased, respectively, while cytosolic pH was significantly increased. The low [PCr] (data not shown) and the high pH resulted in a calculated free <ref type="bibr">[ADP]</ref> significantly increased in patients. The phosphorylation potential was below the normal range in all patients (represented by the reciprocal of the phosphorylation potential in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</p><p>Patients and control subjects exercised inside the magnet, reaching a similar end-exercise PCr concentration (expressed as a percentage of the resting level in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). The mean end-exercise free [ADP], although increased in s-IBM patients, was not statistically different from that in control subjects (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). In all s-IBM patients an end-exercise [ADP] well above the K m value of 30 µM <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kemp et al., 1993b)</ref> is expected to have fully stimulated the mitochondrial ATP production. Under these conditions the rate of PCr resynthesis after exercise is a very sensitive index of the rate of mitochondrial ATP production. All the s-IBM patients showed an initial rate of PCr recovery, V, within the normal range (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). Using the ADP control model for mitochondrial respiration <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chance and Williams, 1955)</ref> we calculated the maximum rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis, V max , from V and the end-exercise [ADP] <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kemp et al., 1993b)</ref>. Oxidative metabolism was also assessed as postexercise ADP recovery half time, a measurement independent of the absolute metabolite concentration. Both V max and the ADP recovery rate are convenient assessments of muscle mitochondrial respiration, as they are independent of the degree of PCr breakdown and cytosolic acidification at the end of exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lodi et al., 1997a)</ref>. Mitochondrial V max did not differ between patients and control subjects, i.e. all s-IBM patients showed a V max within the normal range (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</p><p>There was no correlation between V max and the degree of MRI abnormalities of calf muscle expressed as Calf Muscle Score (r ϭ 0.1, P ϭ 0.7) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Normal mitochondrial respiration was confirmed by the ADP recovery half time, which was within the normal range in all patients (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). ADP recovery half time did not correlate with the Calf Muscle Score (data not shown).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Pathogenesis of s-IBM is still unknown. A number of observations have shown that mitochondrial alterations and abnormalities of mtDNA are common findings in the skeletal muscle of patients with s-IBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Oldfors et al., 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Oldfors et al., , 1995;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rifai et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Santorelli et al., 1996)</ref>. In primary mitochondrial disorders these changes are associated with a deficit of in vivo muscle mitochondrial ATP production as assessed by 31 P-MRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arnold et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Taylor et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lodi et al., 1997c)</ref>. Our results confirmed the frequent occurrence of mitochondrial changes such as ragged red fibres, cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibres and multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle biopsy specimens of patients with s-IBM. On the other hand, in vivo muscle energy metabolism was unaltered in all 12 of the s-IBM patients we studied using 31 P-MRS. Abnormalities of mitochondrial respiration can be detected using 31 P-MRS, by stressing skeletal muscle with an aerobic incremental exercise and following the recovery phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barbiroli, 1992)</ref>. When exercise is stopped, mitochondria are the only source of ATP synthesis and the PCr resynthesis rate reflects very precisely the rate of ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Taylor et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arnold et al., 1984)</ref>. We did not detect any deficit of the muscle oxidative metabolism in s-IBM patients as shown by the initial rate of PCr recovery, V, and mitochondrial V max which were within the normal range in all cases (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). This result is not due to the variable degree of involvement of calf muscle by the pathological process in different patients as no correlation was found between mitochondrial V max and the degree of calf muscle MRI abnormalities (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Normal muscle mitochondrial respiration in s-IBM was confirmed by the post-exercise ADP recovery half time, which was within the normal range in all patients.</p><p>In contrast to the finding of a normal rate of oxidative ATP production during recovery from exercise, all patients showed abnormalities at rest. In the patient group we observed a significant reduction in the PCr to ATP ratio, an increase in the P i to ATP ratio and a raised intracellular pH. The accepted method for calculating [ADP], [PCr] and [P i ] in skeletal muscle is to assume constant values for [ATP] and [TCr], obtained from biochemical assay <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arnold et al., 1985)</ref>, and to derive [PCr] and [P i ] from their spectral ratios with ATP and [Cr] by subtraction of [PCr] from <ref type="bibr">[TCr]</ref> (see also Patients and methods section). Using this traditional method, we observed a significant reduction in [PCr] associated with an apparently stoichiometric increase in P i concentration in the patient group (data not shown). As result of the low [PCr] and high cytosolic pH, the free (metabolically active) [ADP], calculated from the creatine kinase reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Veech et al., 1979)</ref>, was significantly increased in s-IBM patients.</p><p>[ADP] and [P i ] are incorporated into the calculation of the phosphorylation potential, for which all s-IBM patients were below the normal range (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). As ADP is a major regulator of respiration <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chance and Williams, 1955)</ref>, raised [ADP] at rest is frequently observed in patients with primary mitochondrial myopathies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Matthews et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Taylor et al., 1994)</ref>. However, high resting [ADP] is not necessarily an index of abnormal mitochondrial control; it could point to increased ATP turnover. Increased [ADP] at rest is observed in the absence of mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies and in manifesting carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kemp et al., 1993a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kemp et al., , 1997))</ref>. One possible explanation for the high resting ADP might be an increased demand at rest for ATP in muscles of both s-IBM and Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy patients. Sarcolemmal abnormalities due to dystrophin deficit in Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy are responsible for a number of ionic changes which may require increased basal ATP consumption. We can speculate that this might also be the case in s-IBM, where sarcolemmal damage due to the cell-mediated inflammatory process may result in increased basal ATP consumption. The high resting cytosolic pH, present in Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy and s-IBM, but only occasionally reported in mitochondrial myopathies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arnold et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Matthews et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Taylor et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lodi et al., 1997c)</ref>, is a clear index of abnormal ionic regulation, and in Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy it has been interpreted as a consequence of an increase in the Na ϩ /H ϩ antiport set point due to high sarcoplasmic [Ca 2ϩ ] <ref type="bibr">(Frelin et al., 1988)</ref>.</p><p>It can be seen from the data in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> that the calculated free [ADP] in resting muscle is high, especially for the patient group, when compared with a K m of 30 µM for ADP. It should be noted that calculation of free [ADP] at rest is particularly prone to error as <ref type="bibr">[PCr]</ref> is not very different from [TCr], and small errors in either value give rise to substantial errors in <ref type="bibr">[Cr]</ref>, and hence to calculated free [ADP]. However, the differences in PCr to ATP ratios and pH between the two groups strongly suggest that [ADP] at rest probably is raised in s-IBM relative to control subjects. Because calculating [ADP] accurately depends on a precise knowledge of <ref type="bibr">[TCr]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[ATP]</ref>, and this would require biochemical assay of muscle from each subject from the same volume as that studied by 31 P-MRS, these uncertainties cannot be resolved from the data available in the present study. As discussed above, the high pH is suggestive of sarcolemmal changes which would lead to altered ion handling. It might reasonably be expected that these alterations would be accompanied by concentration changes in the metabolites involved in cellular energetics, such as creatine and these phosphorylated compounds. Since PCr to ATP, P i to ATP and PCr to P i ratios are altered in s-IBM, the concentration of one or more of these metabolites must be abnormal. It is important to stress that the possible errors in the calculation of metabolite concentrations do not affect the comparison of oxidative metabolism in s-IBM patients with that in control subjects, assessed from data collected during recovery from exercise. In particular, a lower [TCr] in the s-IBM patients would result in an even higher V max , as a consequence of a lower calculated [ADP] at the end of exercise, and the post-exercise ADP recovery half time <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arnold et al., 1984)</ref> is a kinetic measurement independent of absolute <ref type="bibr">[ADP]</ref>.</p><p>Despite a previous report identifying deficiencies in individual respiratory chain enzyme activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Santorelli et al., 1996)</ref>, we could find no evidence of a defect in overall muscle oxidative phosphorylation in our s-IBM patient group. The normal mitochondrial respiration found in the present study in all s-IBM patients is not due to lack of involvement of the muscles we investigated. In addition to myopathic electromyographic changes present in the calf muscles of all our s-IBM patients, all cases but one showed MRI abnormalities in their calf muscles, and 31 P-MRS abnormalities of the same muscles at rest were also detected in all patients. This is robust evidence that the muscles showing a normal mitochondrial respiration were not spared by the pathological process. As we investigated a relatively large volume of muscle, we cannot exclude an oxidative phosphorylation defect in a small proportion of muscle fibres. However, resting 31 P-MRS abnormalities indicate that muscle biochemical changes other than deficits of mitochondrial respiration are a feature of the skeletal muscle in s-IBM, and that mitochondrial alterations seen on muscle biopsy are likely to be a secondary manifestation. This is consistent with a preliminary report showing that mtDNA abnormalities are present in muscle, but not in lymphocytes, of patients with s-IBM, and that there is no correlation between mtDNA abnormalities and muscle biopsy changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sanders et al., 1997)</ref>.</p><p>There is no known treatment for s-IBM. Patients with s-IBM do not usually respond to immunosuppressants <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Danon et al., 1982)</ref>, and a recent controlled trial of high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin did not show clear benefit <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dalakas et al., 1997)</ref>.
