<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Ataxia and peripheral neuropathy are the most common neurological manifestations of gluten sensitivity. Myopathy is a less common and poorly characterized additional neurological manifestation of gluten sensitivity. We present our experience with 13 patients who presented with symptoms and signs suggestive of a myopathy and in whom investigation led to the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity. Three of these patients had a neuropathy with or without ataxia in addition to the myopathy. The mean age at onset of the myopathic symptoms was 54 years. Ten patients had neurophysiological evidence of myopathy. Inflammatory myopathy was the most common finding on neuropathological examination. One patient had basophilic rimmed vacuoles suggestive of inclusion-body myositis. Six patients received immunosuppressive treatment in addition to starting on a gluten-free diet; five improved and one remained unchanged. Among seven patients not on immunosuppressive treatment, four showed clinical improvement of the myopathy with a gluten-free diet. The improvement was also associated with reduction or normalization of serum creatine kinase level. The myopathy progressed in one patient who refused the gluten-free diet. Myopathy may be another manifestation of gluten sensitivity and is likely to have an immune-mediated pathogenesis. A gluten-free diet may be a useful therapeutic intervention.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>thy). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Neurological manifestations can occur even in the absence of an enteropathy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> A review of all published studies from 1964 to 2000 (single and multiple case reports) of 83 patients with established celiac disease who then developed neurological illness showed that the most common neurological manifestations were ataxia (29 patients) and peripheral neuropathy (29 patients). <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> The third most common entity was myopathy (13  patients). Myopathy in the context of gluten sensitivity has not been well characterized. Muscle involvement in the context of gluten sensitivity might be predicted given that antibodies against endomysium are the most sensitive markers for the presence of enteropathy seen in a subgroup of patients with gluten sensitivity (i.e., patients with celiac disease). The antigen that endomysium antibodies recognize is tissue transglutaminase type 2 (TG2). <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> We now report the clinical, neurophysiological, and neuropathological characteristics of a series of 13 patients with gluten sensitivity who presented with symptoms and signs of myopathy. Investigation led to the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity. We also report the effect of treatment with a gluten free-diet with and without additional immunosuppressive treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p>The 13 patients were part of a cohort of 300 patients referred to and attending our gluten sensitivity/neurology clinic over the last 12 years. All 13 patients presented to a general neurology clinic primarily with symptoms and signs of myopathy. Some had, in addition, other neurological symptoms and signs (e.g., ataxia, peripheral neuropathy). All patients were extensively investigated for the underlying cause of myopathy and the only potential cause found was that of gluten sensitivity. Only one of the patients already had a diagnosis of celiac disease prior to their neurological presentation. In the remaining 12, the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity was the result of investigating the cause of the myopathy. Following the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity, all patients were followed regularly at the gluten sensitivity/neurology clinic.</p><p>Nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG) were performed at least once in all patients. In most instances nerve conduction studies were performed as follows: sensory studies in median and sural nerves; and motor studies in median and peroneal nerves. When needle EMG was performed, the muscles usually examined were deltoid, abductor pollicis brevis or first dorsal interosseous, vastus medialis, and tibialis anterior.</p><p>Following the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity on serological grounds, all patients underwent duodenal biopsy. These were taken from the distal duodenum using biopsy forceps, through a conventional forward-viewing endoscope (Key-Med, Southend, UK). Four biopsies were taken from the third part of the duodenum. The presence of gluten-sensitive enteropathy was established by histological examination for evidence of crypt hyperplasia, villous atrophy, and increase in the intraepithelial lymphocytes.</p><p>All patients underwent needle or open muscle biopsy at least once. A portion of the muscle biopsy was frozen and cryostat sections prepared. The following panel of stains and histochemistry was then performed: hematoxylin and eosin; Engel's trichrome; periodic acid-Schiff; oil red O; acid phosphatase; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR); succinate dehydrogenase; and ATPases at acid and alkaline pH for fiber typing. Remaining tissue was fixed in formalin for the preparation of paraffin sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical</head><p>Characteristics. The clinical and serological characteristics of all 13 patients are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The male:female ratio was 5:8. The mean age at onset of the myopathic symptoms was 54 years (range, 16 to 76). Eight patients (62%) had predominantly proximal weakness, four patients (31%) had both proximal and distal weakness, and one patient had primarily distal weakness. Two patients had ataxia and neuropathy in addition to the myopathy, and one patient had just neuropathy in addition to the myopathy. The most common additional autoimmune disease encountered in these patients was hypothyroidism (2 patients). In addition, three patients had high thyroid antibody titers with normal thyroid function tests. Only one patient was found to be biochemically hypothyroid at the time of presentation of the myopathy (patient 6). This patient was the only patient known to have celiac disease prior to presenting with proximal weakness. All patients had circulating antigliadin antibodies and two patients also had antiendomysium antibodies. Ten patients had the HLA-DQ2 genotype, two the HLA-DQ8, and one the HLA-DQ1. Serum creatine kinase (CK) level ranged between normal and 4380 IU/L at presentation (normal, 25-190 IU/L). Enteropathy was identified following duodenal biopsy in six patients.</p><p>Neurophysiological Assessments. Sensory and motor nerve conduction studies were normal in 10 patients. Three patients (nos. 2, 7, and 9) had reduced compound muscle action potentials in the lower limb. EMG showed typical myopathic features (shortduration, small-amplitude motor unit potentials) in at least one proximal leg muscle in 10 patients (nos. 2-5, 7, 8 and 10 -13). Fibrillation potentials were also seen in two patients (nos. 4 and 12). Of the remaining three patients, two showed only long-duration motor unit potentials (nos. 1 and 9) and in one patient (no. 6) EMG was entirely normal. Some patients had further neurophysiological assessments. In patients 2, 7, 8, and 10, subsequent examinations showed abnormalities of sensory nerve conduction suggesting the development of axonal peripheral neuropathy in addition to myopathy.</p><p>Neuropathology. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> contains the details of the neuropathological examination of muscle in all 13 patients. The most common finding was that of an inflammatory myopathy with a polymyositis-like pic-ture (6 patients). One patient (no. 2) also had evidence of basophilic rimmed vacuoles compatible with the diagnosis of inclusion-body myositis. The remaining patients had non-specific myopathic changes including internal nuclei, rounded atrophic fibers, and patchy staining loss for oxidative enzyme activity. None of the biopsies showed changes of neurogenic atrophy.</p><p>Effect of Gluten-Free Diet. It is difficult to assess in isolation the effect of a gluten-free diet on the myopathy in those six patients (nos. 2-4, 9, 11, and 12) who also received immunosuppressive treatment. Overall, five of these six patients improved and one (no. 11) remained clinically unchanged but with normal serum CK. Of particular interest is the patient with inclusion-body myositis (no. 2). He refused a gluten-free diet initially. Further assessment because of clinical deterioration showed the development of sensory axonal neuropathy. The neuropathy improved while on gluten-free diet alone within 1 year of strict adherence to the diet. Subsequent introduction of prednisolone and azathioprine and continuation of a strict gluten-free diet resulted in normalization of the serum CK and improvement in muscle strength.</p><p>Of the seven patients who did not receive immunosuppressive treatment, one patient (no. 6) was already on the gluten-free diet at the time of presentation when she was found to have hypothyroidism. She was the only patient with a preceding diagnosis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy when she developed myopathy. Her adherence to the diet was assessed serologically and was deemed strict as circulating gliadin, endomysium, and transglutaminase antibodies were negative. Her symptoms improved with the introduction of thyroxine, with normalization of serum CK (from 459 to 157 IU/L; normal, 25-190 IU/L). She still has some mild residual proximal weakness.</p><p>One patient (no. 8) opted not to adopt a glutenfree diet. She was given vitamin D supplementation (for deficiency at presentation) but without any evidence of clinical improvement. She continued to deteriorate slowly with increasing proximal weakness and, 3 years later, developed sensory symptoms in all limbs. The levels of monoclone (patient had a monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance) remained unchanged. Further neurophysiological assessment showed new abnormalities in keeping with sensory neuropathy. She died shortly thereafter from an unrelated cause.</p><p>Another patient (no. 13) was also found to have low levels of vitamin D. There was no evidence of enteropathy on biopsy. He is currently on vitamin D supplementation without clinical improvement. He has refused to go on a gluten-free diet.</p><p>The four remaining patients (nos. 1, 5, 7, and 10) adopted strict gluten-free diet without additional immunosuppressive treatment. Myopathic symptoms improved in all of these cases. In patient 1 there was a significant reduction of serum CK following the introduction of a gluten-free diet, with evidence of elimination of antigliadin antibodies (2636 down to 1340 IU/L). The serum CK gradually increased to 4100 IU/L following re-exposure to gluten. The patient is currently on a gluten-free diet and remains asymptomatic but with serum CK elevated to just under 1000 IU/L. Patient 5 also improved significantly following the introduction of a gluten-free diet. Her serum CK was 1086 IU/L at presentation but normalized to 51 IU/L while following a gluten-free diet, with serological evidence of elimination of antigliadin antibodies. Subsequent elevations of serum CK up to 727 IU/L were associated with positive antigliadin and tissue transglutaminase antibodies as a result of a less strict gluten-free diet.</p><p>Patient 7 presented with falls and unsteadiness. Over a period of 7 years she progressed and developed difficulty in walking up and down stairs. Examination revealed cerebellar dysarthria, gait ataxia, and global weakness. She had evidence of cerebellar atrophy on computerized tomography scan and inflammatory myopathy on muscle biopsy. She refused steroid treatment. She started the gluten-free diet in 2002 with slow but definite improvement in muscle strength and ataxia. Her serum CK normalized within a year of commencing the gluten-free diet. Patient 10 presented with painful muscles and proximal weakness. Initial neurophysiological assessment was suggestive of myopathy. Repeat assessment several years later showed evidence of a sensory neuropathy in addition to the myopathic abnormalities.</p><p>At this stage she went onto a gluten-free diet. She has experienced complete resolution of all her neurological symptoms over a period of 2 years on a strict gluten-free diet, with elimination of antigliadin antibodies. Repeat neurophysiological assessment 4   years after the introduction of a gluten-free diet showed resolution of the neuropathy. EMG was not performed on this occasion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The spectrum of abnormalities seen on muscle histology in these 13 patients suggests that gluten sensitivity-associated myopathy may have diverse pathogenic mechanisms but that muscle inflammation is a common feature. The landmark publication by Cooke et al. on the neurological manifestations in patients with established celiac disease was followed by the publication of a pathological study by the same investigators providing information on muscle and nerve biopsies from 11 of the patients previously described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> The muscle abnormalities reported were predominantly secondary to nerve degeneration as all patients had severe neuropathies. A subsequent study from Sweden <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> reported that, of 76 patients with suspected polymyositis investigated at a neuromuscular unit, 17 had a history of gastrointestinal symptoms and signs together with evidence of malabsorption. Fourteen of these patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for polymyositis and, of these, five were diagnosed with celiac disease. Not all of the 76 patients, however, were specifically screened for the presence of gluten sensitivity. Given that gastrointestinal symptoms are only present in one of eight patients with celiac disease, it is difficult to derive a prevalence figure of gluten sensitivity in patients with polymyositis based on this report. In our experience with 300 patients presenting with neurological manifestations of gluten sensitivity over the last 12 years, myopathy is an uncommon manifestation compared with ataxia or neuropathy, which are by far the most common neurological presentations of gluten sensitivity.</p><p>In some of our 13 cases, an alternative etiology for the myopathy was considered, such as hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, or idiopathic polymyositis. An alternative etiology is likely in one of these patients based on the response of the myopathy to thyroxine supplementation with normalization of the serum CK. Nutritional osteomalacia (vitamin D deficiency) has been reported as a cause of proximal myopathy mainly in developing countries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Vitamin D deficiency in the context of gluten sensitivity has been attributed to malabsorption, but neither of our two patients with vitamin D deficiency had any evidence of enteropathy on biopsy nor did they have any other features to suggest malabsorption. It is also unlikely that vitamin D deficiency was the cause of their myopathy because vitamin D supplementation was not associated with clinical improvement.</p><p>It is plausible that gluten sensitivity in some of these patients was coincidental, perhaps reflecting the coexistence of more than one autoimmune disease (e.g., idiopathic polymyositis or inclusion-body myositis and gluten sensitivity). It is impossible to prove a causal association in those patients who received immunosuppressive treatment in addition to adopting a gluten-free diet. In favor of myopathy being another rare manifestation of gluten sensitivity is the experience of the four patients from these series whose myopathy appears to have responded to a gluten-free diet without the use of immunosuppressive medication. This clinical improvement was associated with reduction or normalization of the serum CK and, in two cases, clinical deterioration following gluten challenge.</p><p>One of our patients with inclusion-body myositis had a neuropathy that responded to a gluten-free diet; the myopathy appeared responsive to the subsequent use of immunosuppressive treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine.</p><p>Sporadic inclusion-body myositis (IBM) is the most common cause of myopathy in patients over 50 years of age. The neurological manifestations of gluten sensitivity are also commonly seen in patients over the age of 50 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> The etiology of IBM remains obscure but may well have an autoimmune basis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Sporadic IBM is associated with HLA-DQ2 in 79% of cases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> HLA-DQ2 has a strong association with other autoimmune diseases and is found in 90% of patients with celiac disease. It has been suggested that a substantial proportion (œæ50%) of cases labeled as having idiopathic polymyositis may prove to have IBM after re-evaluation with repeat biopsies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> We cannot therefore exclude the possibility that more of our patients with gluten sensitivity and a polymyositis-like picture may have sporadic IBM. The strong HLA-DQ2 association and the shared autoimmune pathogenesis suggest that screening for gluten sensitivity should be considered in all patients with IBM but also in patients with otherwise unexplained myopathies. This is particularly important based on our experience that such a subgroup of patients with gluten sensitivity and IBM may respond to a gluten-free diet with or without immunosuppressive treatment. Supporting evidence for this also comes from a case report of a patient with celiac disease, neuropathy, ataxia, and IBM showing clinical and histological improvement of all the neurological manifestations, including the muscle histology following introduction of a gluten-free diet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> The mechanism of muscle damage in these cases remains unclear but is likely to have an immunological basis as is the case in other extraintestinal manifestations of gluten sensitivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Antibodies against endomysium are the most specific markers of glutensensitive enteropathy. Antigliadin antibodies, however, are the most sensitive markers of the whole spectrum of gluten sensitivity. The autoantigen in gluten-sensitive enteropathy has been shown to be TG2. This is the antigen recognized by endomysium antibodies. Transglutaminases are a group of calcium-dependent intracellular enzymes that catalyze the cross-linking of glutamine donor proteins such as gliadins. TG2 is present in normal muscle and tends to be restricted to some endomysial connective tissue elements. The expression of TG2 is increased fourfold in the muscle of patients with IBM, perhaps reflecting increased participation in the formation of insoluble amyloid deposits in the muscles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Another study comparing TG2 expression in other types of inflammatory myopathies (polymyositis and dermatomyositis), normal muscle, and muscle from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy demonstrated TG2 expression to be increased only in patients with inflammatory myopathies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Additional evidence to suggest that muscle can be one of the extraintestinal target organs in gluten sensitivity comes from recent work demonstrating the presence of IgA deposits against TG2 in the small bowel of patients with gluten sensitivity early in the disease course. Such deposits have been demonstrated in extraintestinal target sites such as muscle in a patient with celiac disease and myopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> and cerebellar tissue in a patient with gluten ataxia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> It therefore appears that transglutaminases play a central role in the pathogenesis of both intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations of gluten sensitivity.</p><p>It is as yet unclear what triggers muscle dysfunction in only a small proportion of patients with gluten sensitivity. It has been proposed that the type of transglutaminase may be the key factor determining the type of manifestation seen in the context of gluten sensitivity, for example, enteropathy, dermatopathy, or neurological manifestations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> We conclude that myopathy may be a manifestation of gluten sensitivity and may have an immunemediated pathogenesis. Patients presenting with myopathy should be screened for the possibility of gluten sensitivity. For those patients with gluten sensitivity and myopathy, a gluten-free diet should be considered as a therapeutic intervention irrespective of the use of immunomodulation.</p><p>We thank the Sheffield Hospitals Charitable Trust for financial support.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1.
