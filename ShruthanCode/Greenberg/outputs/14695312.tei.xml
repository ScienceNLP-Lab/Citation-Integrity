<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) require an efficient system of molecular chaperones whose role is to assure their proper folding and to prevent accumulation of unfolded proteins. The response of cells to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER is termed "unfolded protein response" (UPR). UPR is a functional mechanism by which cells attempt to protect themselves against ER stress, resulting from the accumulation of the unfolded/misfolded proteins. Because intracellular inclusions, containing either amyloid-␤ (A␤) or phosphorylated tau, are the characteristic feature of sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) muscle biopsies, we studied expression and immunolocalization of five ER chaperones, calnexin, calreticulin, GRP94, BiP/GRP78, and ERp72, in s-IBM and control muscle biopsies. Physical interaction of the ER chaperones with amyloid-␤ precursor protein (A␤PP) was studied by a combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting technique in s-IBM and control muscle biopsies, and in A␤PP-overexpressing cultured human muscle fibers. In all s-IBM muscle biopsies, all five of the ER chaperones were immunodetected in the form of inclusions that co-localized with amyloid-␤. By immunoblotting, expression of ER chaperones was greatly increased as compared to the controls. By immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting experiments, ER chaperones co-immunoprecipitated with A␤PP. Our studies provide evidence of the UPR in s-IBM muscle and demonstrate for the first time that the ER chaperones calnexin, calreticulin, GRP94, BiP/GRP78, and ERp72 physically associate with A␤PP in s-IBM muscle, suggesting their playing a role in A␤PP folding and processing.</p></div>

By a combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting technique, we studied the physical interaction of the ER chaperone proteins with A␤PP both in s-IBM muscle and in A␤PP-overexpressing cultured human muscle fibers, because our previous studies demonstrated that intramuscle fiber accumulation of A␤PP/A␤ appears to be an important upstream step in the IBM pathogenic cascade. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> </p></div>

After being washed, the membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combined Immunoprecipitation/Immunoblot Procedure</head><p>To evaluate whether calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, GRP94, and ERp72 physically associate with A␤PP, a combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblot technique was performed, as we recently described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> In brief, 100 g of total muscle protein from s-IBM and control biopsies was diluted in 1 ml of precipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, pH 8.0, 0.2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mmol/L phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Five g of 6E10 antibody was then added. The reaction mixture was incubated overnight at 4°C on a orbital shaker. Ten l of 50% Protein A:Agarose (BD Transduction Laboratories) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 2 hours at 4°C. That solution was centrifuged for 4 minutes (16,000 ϫ g at 4°C) and the supernatant removed. The precipitated immunocomplex was washed twice with the precipitation buffer by centrifuging 4 minutes (16,000 ϫ g at 4°C). The pellet was resuspended in 30 l of 2ϫ concentrated sample buffer, boiled for 5 minutes, and centrifuged for 5 minutes (16,000 ϫ g at 4°C). Ten l of the supernatant was loaded onto sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and separated by electrophoresis. Gels were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blotted with calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, GRP94, or ERp72 antibody, diluted as described in the immunoblotting section. Then an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham) were used. To confirm the specificity of those experiments the following controls were performed: 1) the antibody against A␤PP, which is used for immunoprecipitation, was omitted. This resulted in a total nondetection of co-immunoprecipitated proteins (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). 2) The primary antibodies used for immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates were omitted, and in these cases immunoblots were reacted only with the secondary antibodies directed against either a monoclonal mouse or a polyclonal rabbit antibody. This immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates did not produce any specific bands (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultured Human Muscle Fibers</head><p>Tissue cultures of normal human muscle were established, as we have described, from satellite cells of portions of diagnostic muscle biopsies from patients who, after all tests were performed, were considered free of muscle disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> Cultures were maintained as recently described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> The A␤PP-gene was transferred into 2-week-old cultured muscle fibers using an adenovirus vector, as described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Four days after the A␤PP gene transfer, A␤PP-overexpressing and control cultures were processed for the combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblot studies as described above for biopsied s-IBM and control muscle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Light-Microscopic Immunocytochemistry s-IBM</head><p>In all s-BM muscle biopsies, 70 to 80% of the vacuolated muscle fibers contained, mainly in their nonvacuolated cytoplasm, numerous well-defined, various sized, plaque-like, dotty, or elongated inclusions strongly immunoreactive with the antibodies against calnexin, calreticulin, ERp72, BiP/GRP78, and GRP94 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In addition, in all biopsies, 10 to 15% of the nonvacuolated, otherwise normal-appearing (on a given cross-section) fibers contained similar inclusions. By double-label fluorescence immunocytochemistry, in all abnormal muscle fibers, inclusions immunoreactive for calnexin, calreticulin, and GRP94 co-localized with A␤-immunoreactivity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). On serial sections pairs stained for BiP/GRP78 and A␤, or ERP72 and A␤, A␤ immunoreactivity was present in the same muscle fibers as those having ER chaperone immunoreactivity (not shown).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Diseased and Normal Human Muscle</head><p>None of the control normal or diseased biopsies had muscle fibers containing s-IBM characteristic inclusions immunoreactive for calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, GRP94, and ERp72. Specifically, regenerating and degenerating muscle fibers in the disease controls were not immunoreactive. When primary antibody was omitted or replaced with nonimmune serum or irrelevant antibody, the above-described immunoreactions were not evident.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunoelectron Microscopy</head><p>In s-IBM abnormal muscle fibers, calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, GRP94, and ERp72 were prominently accumulated on 6-to 10-nm amyloid-like fibrils and on electron-dense amorphous material (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). In addition, each of those proteins was present on small patches on amorphous material and 6-to 10-nm filaments surrounding clusters of PHFs, but was not directly immunolocalized to the PHFs themselves (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunoblots</head><p>In normal and s-IBM muscle biopsies calnexin migrated as a 90-kd band, calreticulin as a60-kd band, and BiP/ GRP78 as a 78-kd band, as previously described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Their expression was much stronger in s-IBM than in normal control muscle biopsies (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). In normal and s-IBM muscle biopsies, ERp72 migrated as 69-and 72-kd bands, and the intensity of the 72-kd band was much stronger in s-IBM biopsies than in normal muscle (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). A 94-kd band corresponding to GRP94 was present in s-IBM, but not in the normal muscle (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunoprecipitation</head><p>Immunoprecipitation of s-IBM and control muscle biopsies with the mouse monoclonal 6E10 antibody, which can recognize either A␤ or A␤PP, followed by Western blotting and immunoprobing with antibodies individually against calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, GRP94, and ERp72, revealed expected bands corresponding to calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, GRP94, and ERp72 in s-IBM muscle, while control muscle did not detectably express any of these bands (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Control experiments were negative (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultured Human Muscle Fibers</head><p>Immunoblots of the 3-week-old control cultured control human muscle fibers had 90-, 60-, 78-, and 94-kd bands corresponding to calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, and GRP94, respectively, and 72-and 69-kd bands of ERp72 (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). In the A␤PP-overexpressing cultured human muscle fibers, immunoprecipitation with 6E10 antibody followed by Western blotting and immunoprobing with antibodies against calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, GRP94, or ERp72, revealed the expected bands similarly A-E: Single-label immunofluorescence illustrates strongly immunoreactive, various-sized inclusions of calnexin, calreticulin, ERp72, BiP/GRP78, and GRP94 in s-IBM vacuolated muscle fibers. Most of the inclusions are present in the vacuole-free cytoplasm. F-K: Double-label immunofluorescence illustrates that in s-IBM muscle fibers the inclusions immunoreactive for calnexin (F), calreticulin (H), and GRP 94 (J) were also immunoreactive for amyloid-␤ (A␤) (G, I, K). Original magnifications, ϫ1100.  <ref type="figure">B, D, I, G</ref>). They also localized at the periphery of the bundles of PHFs, but not on the PHFs themselves (C, E, J). Original magnifications: ϫ42, <ref type="figure">500 (A, C, D, F, H, I</ref>); ϫ33,400 (B, G); ϫ53,400 (E, J). Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Immunoblots and immunoprecipitations of normal control and s-IBM muscle biopsies (top), and normal and A␤PP-overexpressing cultured human muscle fibers (bottom). Muscle biopsies: immunoblots (IM) of muscle homogenates of normal control (C) and s-IBM muscle biopsies (top row) demonstrate in s-IBM a much stronger expression of calnexin (90 kd), calreticulin (60 kd), BiP/GRP78 (78 kd), ERp72 (doublet of 72 and 69 kd), and GRP94 (94 kd) as compared to control muscle biopsies. The actin band shows the protein loading in each specimen. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of control and s-IBM muscle biopsies. IP-1: Immunoprecipitation with 6E10 antibody followed by immunoprobing (IM) with antibodies against calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, ERp72, and GRP94 reveals strong bands of the appropriate molecular weight corresponding to the given ER chaperones in s-IBM muscle, whereas controls do not express any bands. IP-2: Immunoprecipitation with omission of 6E10 antibody, followed by immunoprobing (IM) with antibodies against calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, ERp72, and GRP94 does not reveal any bands. IP-3: Immunoprecipitation step as in IP-1, but immunoblots were reacted only with the secondary antibodies directed against either a monoclonal mouse or a polyclonal rabbit antibody. This immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates does not produce any specific bands. Culture muscle fibers: immunoblots (IM) (top row) of two homogenates of 3-week-cultured human muscle fibers shows expression of calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, ERp72, and GRP94. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of control (C) and A␤PP-overexpressing (A␤PPϩ) cultured human muscle fibers. IP with 6E10 antibodies followed by immunoprobing with antibodies against calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, ERp72, and GRP94 shows, in the A␤PPϩ cultured muscle fibers, bands of the appropriate molecular weight corresponding to each ER chaperone, whereas controls do not express any bands. IP with antibodies against calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, and GRP94, followed by immunoprobing with 6E10 antibody shows in the A␤PPϩ-cultured muscle fibers a 130-kd band corresponding to A␤PP, while controls are negative.</p><p>to the s-IBM-biopsied muscle. Immunoprecipitation of control cultured human muscle fibers did not reveal any bands (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). In the reverse experiments, immunoprecipitation with the antibodies individually against calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, and GRP94, followed by Western blotting and immunoprobing with anti-A␤ mouse monoclonal 6E10 antibody, revealed an ϳ130-kd band corresponding to the mature form of A␤PP. Control cultured human muscle fibers did not have any bands corresponding to A␤PP (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Considered together, these studies suggest that in A␤PP-overexpressing cultured human muscle fibers, similarly to the s-IBM-biopsied muscle, calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, GRP94, and ERp72 co-immunoprecipitate with A␤PP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UPR in s-IBM Muscle</head><p>Our immunoblot studies demonstrate that expression (meaning detectability) of five ER-chaperone proteinscalnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, GRP94, and ERp72-is increased in s-IBM muscle biopsies. This could be reflecting increased genetic expression or decreased turnover of the protein. Our immunocytochemical studies demonstrate that these ER chaperones are abnormally, multifocally accumulated in s-IBM muscle fibers, where they co-localize with A␤ by light microscopy. By gold immunoelectron microscopy, the ER chaperones immunolocalize to 6-to 10-nm amyloid-like fibrils and to floccular/amorphous material. In s-IBM muscle fibers, the 6to 10-nm amyloid-like fibrils are known to contain immunoreactive A␤ but lack the C-and N-termini of A␤PP; whereas, the floccular/amorphous material, contains both A␤ and the C-and N-termini of A␤PP, and is proposed to represent insoluble but less-organized amyloid or preamyloid. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> Accordingly, in s-IBM muscle fibers, ER chaperones associate with structures containing A␤ and A␤PP. Moreover, our immunoprecipitation results demonstrate, in s-IBM muscle and in the A␤PP-overexpressing cultured human muscle fibers, that the five ER chaperones physically interact with A␤PP-this suggests they possibly play a role in folding, or attempted folding, of A␤PP/A␤ in s-IBM muscle.</p><p>The Presence of UPR in s-IBM Muscle Fibers Suggests that Unfolded Proteins Are Contributing to s-IBM Pathogenesis</p><p>The ER-resident chaperone proteins up-regulated as part of the UPR are in three main groups, each of which has been investigated in this study. One group includes peptide-binding molecular chaperones BiP/GRP78, GRP94, and GRP170. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> BiP/GRP78 and GRP94, the most well-characterized peptide-binding proteins, interact transiently with protein-folding intermediates to prevent aggregation of a protein by keeping it in a foldingcompetent state. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Interaction between the chaperones and proteins ensures that only proteins that are properly assembled and folded leave the ER compartment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> The second group is comprised of the disulfide isomerase family, including PDI, ERp72, ERp59, and ERp29. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> These are involved in protein folding by functioning as oxidoreductases in the formation/isomerization of disulfide bonds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> In addition, PDI, ERp72, ERp59, and ERp29 also have peptide-binding activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> The third group includes calreticulin and calnexin, two homologous lectins that bind transiently to newly synthesized, not yet folded glycoprotein intermediates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> They bind to glycoproteins only when they have monoglucosylated N-glycan, and they promote folding, delay oligomerization, and prevent degradation of them. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Unfolding or misfolding of proteins can occur in vivo and in vitro under several circumstances, including macromolecular crowding, oxidative stress, exposure to toxins, and aging. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> In s-IBM muscle, there is increased transcription of several genes, eg, A␤PP-751, cellular prion protein, enzymes involved in cellular defense against oxidative stress, and c-Jun. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> There is also abnormal accumulation of RNA, ectopic expression of RNApolymerase II, and abnormalities of signal transduction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> These phenomena might be contributing to abnormal accumulation and crowding of proteins, which could lead to their unfolding, abnormal glycosylation, and other consequences deleterious to muscle-cell proteins and their vital functions. Even though the s-IBM inclusions contain several aggregated proteins, A␤PP/A␤ appears to play a key role in IBM pathogenesis. For example, in s-IBM muscle: A␤PP/A␤ accumulation appears to precede other abnormalities and large intracellular inclusions composed of A␤ are congophilic, indicating its misfolded, ␤-pleated sheet configuration as amyloid. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Moreover, experimentally induced intracellular overexpression of A␤PP in cultured human muscle fibers leads to aspects of the IBM phenotype in them, including A␤PP/ A␤-containing congophilic inclusions, abnormal mitochondria, and aspects of oxidative stress. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Our present study does not preclude that in s-IBM muscle ER chaperones might be associated with other accumulated proteins, but, by our immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting, it demonstrates for the first time their physical association with A␤PP, both in s-IBM muscle and in A␤PPoverexpressing cultured muscle fibers. This suggests their participation in the folding and removal of the excessively synthesized A␤PP, and/or of its proteolytic product A␤. Although binding of calreticulin and BiP/ GRP78 to A␤PP has previously been reported in other systems, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> our studies are the first to demonstrate that calnexin, GRP94, and ERp72 physically associate with A␤PP, which suggests an importance of ER chaperones in A␤PP folding.</p><p>We propose that the ERS is part of the IBM pathogenic cascade, occurring in response to abnormally unfolded or misfolded proteins; and that the UPR, evidenced by increased expression of the five ER chaperones calnexin, calreticulin, BiP/GRP78, GRP94, and ERp72, is an attempt to facilitate proper folding of malfolded proteins, and/or their disposal.</p><p>However, the presence of the amyloid-positive (ie, congophilic) inclusions, indicates that the UPR is not completely effective. This may be related, at least partially, to an inhibition in s-IBM muscle of the 26S proteasome, which participates in the disposal of malfolded proteins. Our recent studies demonstrated that mutated ubiquitin, termed UBB ϩ1 , previously shown to inhibit 26S proteasome activity in other systems, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> is abnormally accumulated in s-IBM muscle fibers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> Future experimental studies should elucidate the possibility of a functional relationship between putative proteasome inhibition and the demonstrated ER stress and the UPR observed in s-IBM muscle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Therapeutic Perspective</head><p>New, putatively pathogenic phenomena have been identified in s-IBM. They suggest that one would like to stop the intracellular increase of the unfolded/misfolded proteins by reducing their formation and/or increasing their disposal. How to do this is now the challenge.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
