<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Herp is a stress-response protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Herp was proposed to improve ER-folding, decrease ER protein load, and participate in ERassociated degradation (ERAD). Intra-muscle-fiber ubiquitinated multiprotein-aggregates containing, among other proteins, either amyloid-b (Ab) or phosphorylated tau are characteristic of sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM). ER stress and proteasome inhibition appear to play a role in s-IBM pathogenesis. We have now studied Herp in s-IBM muscle fibers and in ER-stress-induced or proteasome-inhibited cultured human muscle fibers. In s-IBM muscle fibers: (i) Herp was strongly immunoreactive in the form of aggregates, which co-localized with Ab, GRP78, and b2 proteasome subunit; (ii) Herp mRNA and protein were increased. In ER-stress-induced cultured human muscle fibers: (i) Herp immunoreactivity was diffusely increased; (ii) Herp mRNA and protein were increased. In proteasome-inhibited cultured human muscle fibers: (i) Herp immunoreactivity was in the form of aggregates; (ii) Herp protein was increased, but its mRNA was not. Accordingly, in s-IBM muscle fibers: (i) increase of Herp might be due to both ER-stress and proteasome inhibition; (ii) co-localization of Herp with Ab, proteasome, and ERchaperone GRP78 could reflect its possible role in processing and degradation of cytotoxic proteins in ER.</p></div>

An efficient system of molecular chaperones in the ER is required to assure proper folding of misfolded abnormal and native proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kaufman 1999)</ref>. Unfolded proteins accumulating in the ER lead to ER-stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Rutkowski and Kaufman 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Shen et al. 2004</ref>).

The UPR involves: (i) attenuating translation to reduce protein overload and subsequent accumulation of unfolded proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Mori 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liu and Kaufman 2003)</ref>; (ii) transcriptional induction of ER chaperone proteins, which increase folding capacity of the ER and prevent protein aggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Mori 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liu and Kaufman 2003)</ref>; (iii) removing misfolded proteins from the ER through retrograde transport coupled to their degradation by 26S proteasome, called ER-associated degradation (ERAD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Travers et al. 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Herp (homocysteine-induced ER protein) is a novel 54 kDa protein recently described as a stress-response protein localized in the ER membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kokame et al. 2000)</ref>. Under ERstress, Herp is the most highly inducible protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yamamoto et al. 2004)</ref>. Unlike other stress-induced ER chaperones, Herp is an integral membrane protein whose N-and C-terminals both face the cytoplasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kokame et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sai et al. 2002)</ref>. Its N-terminus has an ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kokame et al. 2000)</ref>, which is probably involved in Herp degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sai et al. 2003)</ref>. Cellular functions of Herp are gradually being discovered. It was suggested that during ER stress, Herp plays a neuroprotective role in brain by stabilizing ER Ca 2+ homeostasis and maintaining mitochondrial function <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chan et al. 2004)</ref>. Herp was also proposed to improve ER folding capacity, decrease ER protein load <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hori et al. 2004)</ref>, and participate in the ERAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yamamoto et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schroder and Kaufman 2005)</ref>. Herp was also proposed to prevent apoptosis triggered by ER stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chan et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hori et al. 2004</ref>). Furthermore, Herp was reported to interact with presenilins and, through this mechanism, to increase production of amyloid-b (Ab) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sai et al. 2002)</ref>, which is considered to be cytotoxic in sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) muscle and in Alzheimer disease (AD) brain <ref type="bibr">(Askanas and</ref><ref type="bibr">Engel 2001, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Selkoe 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cuello 2005)</ref>.</p><p>s-IBM, the most common progressive degenerative muscle disease of persons age 50 years and older, is of unknown etiology and pathogenesis <ref type="bibr">(Askanas and</ref><ref type="bibr">Engel 2001, 2002)</ref>. It leads to severe disability and there is no successful treatment <ref type="bibr">(Askanas and</ref><ref type="bibr">Engel 2001, 2003)</ref>. The main lightmicroscopic features of s-IBM muscle biopsies include: (i) vacuolated muscle fibers, (ii) intramuscle-fiber multiprotein aggregates, and (iii) various degrees of mononuclear-cell inflammation <ref type="bibr">(Askanas and</ref><ref type="bibr">Engel 2001, 2003)</ref>. An intriguing feature is the similarity of the s-IBM muscle-fiber phenotype to that of AD brain, including accumulation of Ab, phosphorylated tau, and several other Alzheimer characteristic proteins <ref type="bibr">(Askanas and</ref><ref type="bibr">Engel 2001, 2003)</ref>. Two major types of intracellular inclusion-bodies in s-IBM muscle contain either Ab or phosphorylated tau <ref type="bibr">(Askanas and</ref><ref type="bibr">Engel 2001, 2002)</ref>.

Those ER chaperones physically associate with Ab, suggesting that they may play a role in Ab folding and/or attempted disposal of Ab in s-IBM muscle fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Vattemi et al. 2004)</ref>. Our most recent study demonstrated significant proteasomal inhibition and aggresome formation in s-IBM fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fratta et al. 2005)</ref>. Those studies further support our previous proposal that unfolding and misfolding of proteins play a role in formation of the multiprotein-aggregates (inclusions) within s-IBM muscle fibers <ref type="bibr">(Askanas and</ref><ref type="bibr">Engel 2002, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, we asked whether Herp might play a role in the s-IBM pathogenesis. We examined Herp expression in s-IBM muscle fibers on the mRNA and protein levels, and Herp light-and electronmicroscopic immunolocalization, including its co-immunolocalization with Ab, ER chaperone BiP/GRP78 (immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein/glucose-regulated protein 78), 20S b2 proteasome subunit, and ubiquitin. To explore the mechanisms involved in regulating Herp in human muscle fibers, we utilized ER stress-induced and proteasome-inhibited cultured human muscle fibers.</p></div>

Briefly, 10-lm-thick frozen sections were collected in ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.25% Nadeoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostic, Mannheim, Germany). All samples were rapidly homogenized on ice. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Vattemi et al. 2004</ref>): 20 lg of protein were loaded onto 10% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immuno-probed with antibodies against Herp. After incubation in the appropriate secondary antibodies, blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Protein loading was evaluated by the actin band visualized with a mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Quantification of the immunoreactivity was performed by densitometric analysis using NIH Image J 1.310 software.</p></div>

RNA samples were treated with Dnase I (Amplification Grade, Invitrogen) and 1 lg of RNA was submitted for cDNA synthesis using an oligo-dT primer (Invitrogen) and the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Then 1/10 of the RT reaction was amplified using multiplex PCR in a total volume of 20 lL, with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), utilizing previously described primers for Herp <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kokame et al. 2000)</ref> and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lehmann et al. 2002)</ref> as an internal control. The optimized conditions for Herp and GAPDH amplification were 2 min at 94°C followed by 28 cycles of amplification (94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 90 s), and the final incubation was 10 min at 72°C. The PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Light-microscopic immunocytochemistry</head><p>In all s-IBM muscle biopsies, 70-80% of the vacuolated muscle fibers contained, mainly in their non-vacuolated cytoplasm, numerous various-sized aggregates immunoreactive with antibodies against Herp (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-c</ref>). Approximately 25% of non-vacuolated muscle fibers also contained similar aggregates. By double immunofluorescence, Herp immunoreactive aggregates co-localized with Ab (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d and e</ref>), ubiquitin (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f and g</ref>), b2 proteasome subunit (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h  and i</ref>), and BiP/GRP78 (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1j and k</ref>). None of the control non-s-IBM, diseased or normal, human muscle biopsies had muscle fibers containing aggregates immunoreactive with anti-Herp antibody. Eliminating the primary antibodies or replacing them with non-relevant antibodies resulted in nonstaining.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gold-immuno-electronmicroscopy</head><p>Immunoreactive Herp was associated with Ab, 20S b2 proteasome subunit, and BiP/GRP78 within the same structures, namely the 6-10 nm fibrils and amorphous and floccular material (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Herp was not associated with paired helical filaments, which are known to contain phosphorylated tau in IBM muscle fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mirabella et al. 1996)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunoblots</head><p>In normal and s-IBM muscle, Herp migrated as a single 54 kDa band (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>), and its expression was much stronger in s-IBM muscle as compared to controls. Omission of the primary antibody resulted in no bands being present (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(c</ref>) provides analysis of the data derived from densitometric scans (obtained from seven samples), normalized to b-actin and expressed in arbitrary units. These data indicate that in s-IBM muscle biopsies Herp protein was increased eight-fold (p &lt; 0.05) as compared to controls.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RNA expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction</head><p>As determined by RT-PCR analysis, Herp mRNA was prominently increased in s-IBM as compared to controls (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d and e</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultured human muscle fibers</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Light-microscopic immunocytochemistry</head><p>In control fibers, Herp immunoreactivity was only weak and diffuse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4a</ref>). ER stress-induced cultured human muscle fibers had strong and diffuse Herp immunoreactivity (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4b and c</ref>). In contrast, approximately 80% of the epoxomicin-treated muscle fibers had the Herp protein immunoreactivity in the form of large aggregates ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figs 4d,  e, and g</ref>), which co-localized with ubiquitin immunoreactivity (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4f and h</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunoblots</head><p>Treatment with ER-stress inducers or with epoxomicin prominently increased the Herp protein level as illustrated by two representative culture sets (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>).

This illustrates that both homocysteine-induced endoplasmic reticulum protein (Herp) (5 nm gold particles) and amyloid-b (Ab) (15 nm gold particles) are associated with 6-10 nm fibrils (a) and floccular material (c). Similarly, Herp (5 nm gold) and b2 20S proteasome subunit (15 nm gold) (b, d) and Herp (5 nm gold) and BiP/GRP78 (15 nm gold) (e, f) are associated with the same 6-10 nm fibrils and floccular material.

Thapsigargin, the strongest Herp-inducer, increased Herp about 15-fold (p &lt; 0.01). Tunicamycin and epoxomicin increased Herp six-fold (p &lt; 0.01) and 10-fold (p &lt; 0.05), respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref>). In some thapsigargin, tunicamycin, or epoxomicin treated cultures, additional bands lower than 54 kDa were occasionally observed (not shown). This suggests, as shown previously in PC12 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chan et al. 2004)</ref>, that under certain experimental conditions, some cleavage of Herp can also occur in cultured muscle fibers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting analysis</head><p>To investigate the molecular basis of Herp protein increase, semiquantitative multiplex RT-PCR analysis was performed. Those studies indicated in each experiment that thapsigargin and tunicamycin increased Herp mRNA, whereas epoxomicin appeared to slightly decrease it (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5c and d</ref>). The above data were confirmed by northern blots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5e</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We investigated expression of Herp in normal and diseased human muscle, and studied the mechanisms of Herp regulation in cultured human muscle fibers. We report that in s-IBM muscle fibers, Herp was accumulated in varioussized multifocal aggregates, wherein it co-localized with Ab, ER chaperone BiP/GRP78, and 20S b2 proteasome subunit, by both light-and electronmicroscopic immunocytochemistry.</p><p>In addition, Herp protein and its mRNA were prominently increased in s-IBM muscle fibers. Even though normal human muscle fibers had, on immunoblots, a definite band of Herp, neither in them nor in several non-s-IBM diseased human muscle biopsies was Herp discerned immunocytochemically by light-microscopy. Previous studies have shown Herp mRNA expression in various human organs, including skeletal muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kokame et al. 2000)</ref>, but they did not study Herp protein.  Our studies, based on experimentally modified cultured human muscle, demonstrated two distinct mechanisms of Herp increase in normal human muscle, and they seem directly relevant to s-IBM muscle fibers. Specifically, two ER-stress inducers, tunicamycin and thapsigargin, each increased Herp transcription and translation, which resulted in very strong and diffuse immunoreactivity of its protein. However, proteasome inhibition by epoxomicin increased the amount of Herp total protein without increasing its transcription, and produced striking aggregations of Herp, which, similarly to the s-IBM muscle biopsies, were associated with ubiquitin. As ER-stress and proteasome inhibition are present in s-IBM muscle fibers, we propose that those two mechanisms contribute to the demonstrated Herp abnormalities in s-IBM muscle fibers.</p><p>Even though Herp is considered the most inducible protein during ER-stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yamamoto et al. 2004)</ref>, its exact relationship to the ER-stress is not well understood. Accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in the ER induces ER-stress, which activates three pathways of the UPR, the role of which is to mitigate the ER-stress. One pathway involves preferential translation of transcription-factor ATF4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Shen et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schroder and Kaufman 2005)</ref>. The Herp promoter contains ER-stress-responsive elements, including a cisacting element recognized by ATF4 <ref type="bibr">(Ma and Hendershot 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yamamoto et al. 2004)</ref>. Our preliminary data (not shown) indicate that ATF4 is increased in s-IBM muscle fibers, suggesting that ATF4 may be involved in overexpression of Herp. Whether other transcription factors, such as ATF6 or X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1), participate in Herp induction in s-IBM muscle fibers and in our culture model is not known. Thus, the exact pathways that contribute to Herp activation in s-IBM muscle fibers remain to be studied.</p><p>The half-life of Herp is considered to be very short (2.5 h) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sai et al. 2003)</ref>. Its ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) is responsible for its rapid degradation via the 26S proteasome <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sai et al. 2003)</ref>. Because 26S proteasome activity is inhibited in s-IBM muscle fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fratta et al. 2005)</ref>, this inhibition may contribute to the total increase of Herp protein, as well as its accumulation in the form of ubiquitinassociated aggregates.</p><p>We have also shown other proteins accumulated and aggregated in s-IBM muscle fibers and in our proteasomeinhibited cultures of human muscle fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fratta et al. 2005)</ref>. As Herp was proposed to be linked to both UPR and ERAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yamamoto et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schroder and Kaufman 2005)</ref>, its co-localization with BiP/GRP78, 20S proteasome, and Ab in s-IBM muscle fibers might suggest that Herp in s-IBM is involved in attempted proper folding of proteins and in the pathway of proteasomal removal of improperly folded ones.</p><p>Herp has been previously shown to influence processing of amyloid-b precursor protein (AbPP) and Ab production through its binding to presenilin 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sai et al. 2002)</ref>. Presenilin 1 is increased in s-IBM muscle fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Askanas et al. 1998)</ref>, but our present studies did not address the question of whether Herp participates in AbPP processing and Ab production in s-IBM muscle fibers or in our cultured human muscle fibers.</p><p>A role of Herp in preventing ER-stress-induced apoptotic cell death in non-muscle cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chan et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hori et al. 2004</ref>) is of interest regarding s-IBM muscle fibers. s-IBM fibers do not exhibit features of apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Behrens et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Askanas and Engel 2001)</ref>, despite intracellular existence of several factors, such as increased Ab, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial abnormalities <ref type="bibr">(Askanas and</ref><ref type="bibr">Engel 2001, 2003)</ref> known to induce apoptosis in other cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Loo et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Simonian and Coyle 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Parone et al. 2002)</ref>. We have previously proposed that the multinucleated muscle fibers do not undergo classic apoptosis <ref type="bibr">(Broccolini et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Askanas and Engel 2001)</ref>. In s-IBM muscle fibers, survival motor neuron (SMN) factor and IAP-like protein were previously proposed to play an anti-apoptotic role <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Broccolini et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li and Dalakas 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Askanas and Engel 2001)</ref>. Based on our current data, it is possible that Herp might also contribute to the anti-apoptotic milieu in s-IBM muscle fibers, as was shown in relation to other cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chan et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hori et al. 2004</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our novel findings related to the increase of Herp and its abnormal multifocal accumulation in s-IBM muscle fibers are reported. We demonstrate, for the first time, that two different mechanisms are involved in Herp regulation and accumulation in human muscle fibers. We suggest that Herp, amelioratively, might be facilitating the unfolded protein response and attempting to enhance the ER-associated protein degradation of malfolded proteins in s-IBM muscle fibers. Nevertheless, despite the existence in the s-IBM muscle fibers of Herp and components of the unfolded protein response that are putatively protective, s-IBM is a severely progressive degenerative disease, probably because the factors causing progressive degeneration are more influential than those having a putative protective influence. Accordingly, developing methods that would further up-regulate the protective factors might lead to novel therapeutic avenues.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Immunofluorescence within sporadic inclusion-body myositis muscle fibers.
