<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Article abstract-Objective: To determine whether amyloid-␤ protein (A␤) can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by cultured normal muscle cells. Background: Sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) is characterized by the presence of rimmed vacuoles and fibrillary inclusions of A␤ in muscle fibers, and often inflammatory cells. Endomysial expression of proinflammatory molecules has suggested an ongoing immune process, but the site of sensitization and the mechanisms that trigger an inflammatory reaction is unknown. Methods: The authors used Northern blot analysis and specific immunoassays to study the expression and secretion in cell-free supernatants of tumor necrosis factor-␣ (TNF␣), interleukin-1␤ (IL-1␤), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by purified human myoblasts and C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells incubated with A␤ [1-42] or A␤ [25-35] peptides. Results: Nonstimulated muscle cells produced detectable IL-6, whereas secretion of IL-1␤ and TNF␣ was absent. Incubation with A␤ peptides increased IL-6 production, whereas TNF␣ and IL-1␤ levels remained undetectable. Northern blot analysis of A␤-stimulated human myoblasts revealed an increase in IL-6 mRNA expression. Conclusions: Cultured muscle cells increase the constitutive production of IL-6 in response to local deposition of A␤ in sporadic IBM. IL-6 could be a CD8 ϩ proliferation and differentiation agent, an autocrine proteolysisinducing factor of damaged myotubes, and a proliferation-stimulating agent for satellite cells to replace the destroyed myofibers in IBM. NEUROLOGY 2001;57:1561-1565   Muscle biopsies of inclusion body myositis (IBM) patients show striking pathologic features including abnormal accumulation of amyloid-␤ protein (A␤) within muscle fibers <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> and mononuclear cell inflammation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> which have received considerable attention regarding the pathogenesis of IBM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> However, the role of inflammatory reactions in muscle tissue damage and the mechanisms triggering the production of proinflammatory mediators in IBM have not been clarified yet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Recently, we showed that cultured muscle cells stimulated with A␤ peptides, in the presence of interferon-␥ (IFN␥), produce nitric oxide (NO), <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> supporting a role for A␤ deposition in the pathogenesis of postulated oxidative damage in IBM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> We further examined the effect of A␤ on cultured myogenic cells, testing the hypothesis that they participate in the production of proinflammatory cytokines through interaction with A␤ deposition. We approached this issue by analyzing the effect of A␤ [25-35] and A␤ [1-42] peptides on human muscle cells cultured at clonal density as well as on C2C12 cells, which are a skeletal myoblast cell line derived from the hindlimb of normal mice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Production of tumor necrosis factor-␣ (TNF␣), interleukin-1␤ (IL-1␤), and IL-6 in cell-free supernatants was determined by specific ELISA, whereas the expression of the corresponding mRNA was studied using Northern blot analysis. We demonstrate that in both human and C2C12 muscle cells, A␤ peptides induce gene expression and secretion of IL-6 but do not trigger the production of TNF␣ and IL-1␤. These findings highlight the possibility that in IBM, the interaction of muscle cells with A␤ deposition is responsible for production of IL-6, which can play an important role in local immune response as well as in muscle regeneration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Materials and methods.

A␤ [1-42] and A␤ [1-42] scrambled were aged for 5 days at 37 °C.

Individual wells of 96-well plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) were inoculated with 0.2 mL of cell suspension, and after 2 to 4 days, wells containing single colonies could be identified. When each clone reached 30% to 50% confluency, it was detached with 0.1 mL trypsin/EDTA solution, transferred to a 90-mm Petrie dish, and an aliquot tested for immunoreactivity with mAb anti-Leu 19 antigen (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), which crossreacts with the neural adhesion molecule N-CAM (CD 56) on human myoblasts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> Only Leu-19 -positive colonies were finally propagated. The C2C12 murine cell line was provided by European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results.</head><p>To determine the effect of A␤ peptides on gene expression of TNF␣, IL-1␤, and IL-6 in human muscle, nonfused myoblasts cultured for 1 day were stimulated for 4 hours with 25 mol/L A␤ [1-42] or A␤ [25-35] and then extracted for total RNA. Northern blot analysis (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) shows that human myoblasts do not express mRNA levels for TNF␣ and IL-1␤ either in resting conditions or after stimulation with A␤ peptides or with other stimuli such as TNF␣ or bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (not shown). However, mRNA levels for IL-6 were expressed at low concentrations and were potentiated after treatment with A␤ [1-42], A␤ [25-35], or TNF␣, but not A␤ [25-35] or A␤ [1-42] scrambled peptides.</p><p>Determination of antigenic cytokines in cell-free supernatants harvested from human muscle cultures after as long as 48 hours of incubation revealed that both unstimulated myoblasts and A␤-treated cells did not release TNF␣ and IL-1␤ at levels significantly higher than the detection limits of the assays (5 pg/mL for TNF␣ and 2 pg/mL for IL-1␤) (not shown). Consistently with Northern blot analysis, IL-6 was secreted at detectable levels and production increased after incubation with A␤ [1-42] or A␤ [25-35]  (2.5 Ϯ 0.3-and 2.3 Ϯ 0.2-fold increase above basal levels, p Ͻ 0.05, n ϭ 4 at 24 hours) but not with A␤ [25-35] and A␤ [1-42] scrambled peptides. The effect of A␤ [1-42] and A␤ [25-35] on IL-6 release was dose dependent, with production significant at 2.5 mol/L and progressively increasing to as much as 25 mol/L (figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). Data were also reproduced in C2C12 muscle cells; these cells, stimulated with A␤ [1-42] or A␤ [25-35], also released significant amounts of IL-6 (2.9 Ϯ 0.8-and 2.2 Ϯ 0.4-fold increase above basal levels, p Ͻ 0.05, n ϭ 4 at 24 hours) (see figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).

In this study, we examined the effect of A␤ peptides on the production of proinflammatory cytokines by highly purified human muscle cells. We provide evidence that human myoblasts secrete IL-6 under basal conditions and in response to A␤ protein. Both A␤ [25-35] and A␤ [1-42] peptides were potent inducers of IL-6 secretion through an increase of IL-6 -specific mRNA. Conversely, myogenic cells did not produce TNF␣ or IL-1␤ either under basal conditions or as a result of stimulation with A␤ peptides. Specificity of the effect of A␤ [25-35] and A␤ [1-42]  was demonstrated using peptides with the same amino acid composition but with a scrambled sequence, which did not influence the production of IL-6 from human and murine muscle cells in vitro. Moreover, the release of IL-6 was also demonstrated in cell-free supernatants from A␤-stimulated murine C2C12 muscle cells, which share functional similarities with human myoblasts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is involved in the promotion of immune responses mainly mediated by B and cytolytic T cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> Unlike TNF␣ and IL-1␤, IL-6 displays fewer inflammatory properties because it is unable to stimulate the synthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites, and it participates in the generation of the IL-1 receptor antagonist, known to inhibit IL-1 responses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> IL-6 is produced by normal muscle cells and its expression in vitro is enhanced in response to several proinflammatory agents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> IL-6, together with IL-1␤ and TNF␣, has been shown to be overexpressed in IBM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Our data sug- [1-42] on IL-6 production by human myoblasts.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Effect of amyloid-␤ protein (A␤) peptides on interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by human myoblasts and C2C12 cells. (A) Dose-response effect of A␤</head><p>gest that the effect of A␤ on IL-6 production from human myoblasts might be at least partly responsible for the increase in IL-6 expression in the vacuolated fibers of IBM. Interestingly, IL-1␤ and TNF␣ but not IL-6 have been shown to be produced by A␤-stimulated human monocytes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> Therefore, we believe that one of the pathologic mechanisms leading to cytokine expression in IBM is dependent on A␤ deposition, which can activate both myogenic cells to release IL-6 and mononuclear phagocytes to secrete IL-1␤ and TNF␣, which, in turn, may also enhance the production of IL-6 by muscle cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> In this regard, it has been shown that human macrophages found in muscle of various muscle diseases, including IBM, demonstrate strong immunoreactivity and mRNA for ␤-amyloid precursor protein (␤APP), suggesting that the abnormal accumulation of the correspondent protein is generated, at least partly, by locally increased transcription outside vacuolated muscle fibers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Moreover, interstitial macrophages and those phagocytosing muscle fibers in IBM have been shown to be positive for antibodies against proinflammatory cytokines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> A issue raised by our study is the pathophysiologic role of extracellular A␤ because A␤ in IBM is primarily deposited intracellularly. However, in some abnormal muscle fibers in IBM, the accumulation of ␤APP appears to extend outside the muscle fiber boundary. This may have been attributable to a fragility of the fiber's surface membrane, which could have been transiently broken. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> Alternatively, it is also possible that muscle fibers in IBM secrete A␤. This mechanism has been demonstrated in normal muscle fibers in culture, which secrete A␤ [1-40] and A␤ [1-42] and those secretions are greatly increased in ␤APP-overexpressing cultured muscle fibers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> Therefore, even though intracellular overexpression of the ␤APP gene in muscle can produce several aspects of the IBM cellular phenotype, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> it is possible that extracellular A␤ deposition in IBM exert additional effects.</p><p>Our data showing that myoblasts in vitro can increase production of IL-6 after A␤ stimulation could help in solving the dilemma of IBM, explaining why immune suppression could never get rid of the disease. The antigen would be in fact hidden within the muscle and could induce the immune response only when leaked to the extracellular space. Obviously, more studies are needed to demonstrate definitively the role of A␤ in IBM. The direct injection of A␤ into the muscle and monitoring the tissue response for inflammation could be important in further understanding the in vivo effect of extracellular A␤. Conversely, A␤ gene transfer could be a very suitable model to investigate the role of intracellular A␤ in triggering cytokine production by muscle cells.</p><p>Regardless of the intrinsic or extracellular exposure of muscle fibers to A␤, IL-6 production might be important several ways in the pathophysiology of IBM. IL-6 could synergize with IL-1␤ and TNF␣ in costimulating immune responses. For example, the combination of IL-1␤ and IL-6 could induce naive CD8 ϩ cytotoxic T cells to proliferate and acquire lytic capabilities in the absence of help from accessory and CD4 ϩ cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> The positive effect of IL-6 on B-cell differentiation and thus in antibody production could also account for the B-cell activation previously suggested in IBM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> When dealing with the muscle tissue, however, we have to take into account the direct effects of IL-6 on muscle cells; it can stimulate proteolysis in C2C12 myotubes in vitro and induce myoblast proliferation to replace the destroyed myofibers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> In this regard, because IL-6 has been shown to be expressed in regenerating skeletal muscle, the proliferation rate of myoblasts grown in the presence of IL-6 may add to the evidence that this cytokine contributes to the regenerating capacity of the muscle by modulating the behavior of muscle precursor cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> </p></div>
