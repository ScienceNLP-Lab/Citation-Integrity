<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Mitochondrial DNA variants have been shown to be associated with many diseases. Mutations at mitochondrial DNA nucleotide positions 3192, 3196, 3397 and 4336 have been described in association with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The pathological similarities between inclusion body myositis and Alzheimer's disease prompted an analysis of the relationship between the reported mutations and sporadic inclusion body myositis. The 4336G variant was not signi®cantly increased in patients with inclusion body myositis or Alzheimer's disease when compared to controls. None of the patients with inclusion body myositis carried mutations at nucleotide positions 3192, 3196 and 3397. A transition at nucleotide position 4580 was detected in some patients with inclusion body myositis and Alzheimer's disease but was not signi®cantly higher in frequency when compared to controls. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 4336G and 4580A variants clustered together in their respective group. A group of patients with inclusion body myositis also clustered together on a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree. Closer investigation of this group revealed a common polymorphism at nucleotide position 16311. The frequency of the 16311C variant was higher in inclusion body myositis than in Alzheimer's disease and controls, although when only caucasian patients were considered the increased frequency was not statistically signi®cant. Further studies will be required to determine whether this variant plays a role in the pathogenesis of inclusion body myositis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most commonly diagnosed form of myositis in male patients over 50 years of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The disease has a distinctive set of clinical and pathological features <ref type="bibr">[2±4]</ref>. Clinically it is characterized by insidious development of muscle weakness and atrophy of the distal and proximal muscles of the arms and legs and a poor response to corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Histopathological features include mononuclear in¯ammatory in®ltrates consisting primarily of macrophages and CD8 1 T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, rimmed vacuoles, hyaline eosinophilic inclusions and atrophic angular muscle ®bres. Electron microscopy reveals clusters of 15±21 nm tubulo®lamentous structures. The vacuolated ®bres are remarkable for their accumulation of a range of proteins which include the b-amyloid fragment (bA4) of the amyloid precursor protein, apolipoprotein E, ubiquitin, hyperphosphorylated tau, a1-antichymotrypsin and superoxide dismutase <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In biopsies of affected muscle from patients with sporadic IBM, ragged red and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) negative ®bres are present at increased frequency when compared to age-matched controls and patients with other forms of myositis <ref type="bibr">[7±9]</ref>. Further investigation of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in such ®bres has revealed a high frequency of DNA deletions. These often encompass the COX sub-unit genes and/or other genes encoding proteins of complexes I and IV of the electron transport chain, as well as tRNA genes essential for intra-mitochondrial protein synthesis [ <ref type="bibr">8± 10]</ref>. The relationship between the immune response, the vacuoles, the proteins deposited and the mitochondrial defects in IBM is unclear. The mtDNA deletions may occur as a consequence of the muscle damage caused by other factors Neuromuscular Disorders 10 (2000) 604±611 0960-8966/00/$ -see front matter q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII: S09 60-8966(00)00144-9 www.elsevier.com/locate/nmd such as oxidative stress or the accumulation of bA4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Alternatively, mtDNA damage may be the initiating event and consequent mitochondrial malfunction may set up an environment which leads to the abnormal production of the proteins characteristic of IBM with subsequent muscle damage.</p><p>mtDNA deletions are common in normal, aged individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, but in diseases such as autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (AD-PEO), mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) and mitochondrial myopathies these deletions are markedly increased in frequency [13±15]. This is true in IBM [8±10]. Genetic loci removed from the location of the mtDNA deletions have been associated with these aberrations. Two nuclear genomic loci have been associated with predisposition to an increased frequency of mtDNA replication errors and deletions in families with AD-PEO <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, and mutations in the thymidine phosphorylase gene on chromosome 22 have been implicated in the mtDNA deletions in MNGIE <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. A variant in the D-loop sequence of the mtDNA has also been associated with an increased rate of mtDNA deletions in a family with mitochondrial myopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Analogies between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and IBM have been drawn previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Many of the proteins deposited in IBM are also abnormally accumulated in the brain in AD. These include the bA4 protein, ubiquitin, hyperphosphorylated tau and apolipoprotein E <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Both diseases have onset late in life and in both diseases characteristic paired helical ®laments are detectable in the affected cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. In both diseases there is evidence of mtDNA aberrations. In AD a series of reports have described either inherited mtDNA mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, or somatic mutations in mtDNA derived from the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, each of which has been implicated in disease development.</p><p>In our investigation of genetic factors which predispose to the development of sporadic IBM we have determined whether any of the mtDNA mutations previously reported to be associated with AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> are increased in frequency in IBM. Furthermore we have conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the D-loop sequences of mtDNA in our patients with IBM to determine the relatedness of these sequences to each other. D-loop identity has been described in patients who share a mtDNA mutation elsewhere in the mtDNA genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Any clustering of IBM patients based on D-loop sequences would suggest the presence of a common mutation elsewhere in the mitochondrial genome which may play a role in the development of IBM.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Patients and controls</head><p>DNA samples were obtained from patients diagnosed with sporadic IBM at the Neuromuscular Center, University of Southern California, School of Medicine; the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; the Department of Neurology, Royal Melbourne Hospital; and the Neuromuscular Clinic at the Australian Neuromuscular Research Institute. Diagnosis was based on the published diagnostic criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. All patients had the characteristic pattern of muscle involvement seen in IBM and evidence of rimmed vacuoles and in¯ammatory in®ltrates on muscle biopsy. Electron microscopy was not performed in all cases but those in which it was had the characteristic 18±20 nm tubu-lo®lamentous inclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>DNA samples from patients with AD and control subjects were obtained from the Department of Surgery, Hollywood Private Hospital, Western Australia. All of these patients ful®lled the DSM-IV criteria for dementia of the Alzheimer's type and the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of probable AD as established by a working group of the National institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and by the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Restriction enzyme analysis</head><p>Restriction enzyme analyses, after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampli®cation, were utilized to screen for previously reported mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. A fragment of the mtDNA encompassing the nucleotide position (np) 4336 mutation site (np 4249±4685) was ampli®ed with forward (5 H -CCCCCTCAAACCTAAGAAATAT-3 H ) and reverse (5 H -TATTAGAAGGATTATGGATGC-3 H ) primers. The PCR reaction mixture contained 200 ng genomic DNA, 1.0 mM primers, 200 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 unit Tth DNA polymerase (Biotech International, Perth, Australia) in 1 £ reaction buffer (25 ml total volume). Ampli®cation was accomplished by 30 cycles of incubation at 948C for 30 s, 528C for 30 s and 728C for 30 s. PCR products were digested with NlaIII and fractionated on 3% MetaPhor agarose (FMC Bioproducts, ME). Wild-type samples were digested by NlaIII to produce two fragments of 332 and 105 bp in length. 4336G variants produced three fragments of 241, 105 and 91 bp. 4580A variants do not carry any NlaIII sites within the ampli-®ed sequence.</p><p>Another fragment of mtDNA (np 3121±3526) encompassing the mutation sites at np 3192, 3196 and 3397 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> was ampli®ed with forward (5 H -CTGTACGAAAGGA-CAAGAGA-3 H ) and reverse (5 H -CGGTGATGTA-GAGGGTGAT-3 H ) primers. The PCR reaction mixture was as above but with only 100 ng genomic DNA. The mixture was incubated at 948C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of ampli®cation at 948C for 1 min, 548C for 1 min and 728C for 1 min. Aliquots of the PCR products were used for DdeI, SspI and RsaI digestion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Phylogenetic analysis of the D-Loop</head><p>The D-Loop of the mtDNA from np 15903 to 16517 was ampli®ed with forward (5 H -ACTAATACACCAGTCTTG-TAAACC-3 H ) and reverse (5 H -CCTGAAGTAGGAACCA-GATG-3 H ) primers in PCR mixture as above using PCR conditions of 948C for 1 min, 568C for 1 min and 728C for 2 min (30 cycles). PCR products were used in a dye-terminator (Applied Biosystems, USA) sequencing reaction with the inner primer (5 H -GAAAAAGTCTTTAACTCCACC-3 H ), starting at np 15961. From the sequences obtained, 300 bp were aligned using the ClustalW programme <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Calculation of the phylogenetic distance between sequences was carried out using DNADIST and a phylogenetic tree was constructed with the maximum-likelihood procedure using DNAML <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, with sequences from GenBank as population controls (accession numbers M58058-M58144, M76323, M76328, M76330, M76333, M76335, M76336, M76338, M76345, M76348-M76353) and out-groups (accession numbers M76235-M76239, M76242, M76243, M76281-M76285, M76329, M76331, M76332).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Ampli®cation refractory mutation system assay</head><p>The ampli®cation refractory mutation system (ARMS) assay, developed by Newton and co-workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, was carried out using forward (5 H -GAAAAAGTCTTTAACTCCACC-3 H ; np 15961±15981) and reverse (5 H -ACGGTAAATGGCTT-TATGAA-3 H and 5 H -ACGGTAAATGGCTTTATGAG-3 H ; np 16311±16330) primers to generate a 370 bp fragment of mtDNA (np 15961±16330). The reverse primers were designed such that the primer with an adenine at its 3 H end is complementary only to the 16311T variant while the primer with a guanine is complementary only to the 16311C variant. A further mismatch (T to A) was introduced immediately 5 H to the 3 H nucleotide of both reverse primers to prevent incorrect extension by Tth DNA polymerase. The PCR reaction mixture contained 200 ng genomic DNA, 1.0 mM primers, 200 mM dNTPs, 0.8 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 unit Tth DNA polymerase in 1 £ reaction buffer (25 ml total volume). The mixture was incubated at 948C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of ampli-®cation at 948C for 1 min, 578C for 1 min and 728C for 1 min. Each DNA sample was ampli®ed using both primer sets in separate tubes and the products were fractionated on 1.5% agarose gels for detection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">mtDNA variants in patients with IBM and AD</head><p>Groups consisting of 38 patients with IBM (mean age 69.9 ^10.6 years, range 41±87 years), 142 with AD (mean age 80.2 ^6.8 years, range 55±95 years) and 169 control subjects (mean age 71.4 ^9.2 years, range 52±92 years) were screened for the 4336G variant. The frequency of the 4336G variant in IBM and AD was not signi®cantly different from that in control subjects (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). We detected a previously reported G to A transition at np 4580 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> in our IBM and AD subjects. This however is a silent mutation. The frequency of the 4580A variant was similar in IBM, AD and controls (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Several other mtDNA variants have been described in AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. These included an A to G transition at np 3397, a C to T transition at np 3192 and a G to A transition at np 3196. We screened our panel of patients with IBM (n 37) and found none carrying these variants (data not shown).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Phylogenetic relationship of the mtDNAs in IBM</head><p>We sequenced 300 bp of the D-loop hypervariable region I of patients with AD (n 7) and control subjects (n 6) with either the 4336G or 4580A variants, and a panel of patients with IBM (31 caucasians, one hispanic, one African-American and one of uncertain racial background). A phylogenetic analysis was performed on the sequences and a phylogenetic tree constructed using sequences from GenBank (101 caucasians and 15 non-caucasians) as population controls and out-groups.</p><p>Six subjects with the 4336G mtDNA variant (AD4, AD246, AD756, IBM5, C754 and C906) clustered together on one discrete branch of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). All these samples were found to harbour a T to C transition at np 16304 in the D-loop (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Eight other subjects with the 4580A variant (AD297, AD348, AD431, AD838, IBM24, C122, C1015 and C1042) clustered together on a separate branch (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Alignment of the D-loop sequences revealed that all of these samples harboured a T to C transition at np 16298 in the D-loop region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). A single sample with the 4580A variant (C855) was found outside this cluster. Closer investigation of the sequence revealed an ambiguity of the sequence at np 16298, where a Y (C/T) was found.</p><p>We further studied the distribution of patients with IBM on the phylogenetic tree and found a clustering of ten patients (nine caucasians and one of uncertain racial background) on a discrete branch (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). All these patients shared the same C nucleotide at np 16311 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Three other patients with a C at the same position were found on different branches. Two (one caucasian and one hispanic) harboured the T to C transition at np 16298, although not the 4336G mutation, while another (African±American) showed sequence differences in other parts of the D-loop. Of the 101 random caucasian sequences from GenBank, 22 carried a C at np 16311 and the remainder a T at this position. Interestingly, all but one of the 15 randomly selected Patients with AD (AD4, AD246, AD297, AD348, AD431, AD756, AD838); Patients with IBM (IBM1-IBM17, IBM23-IBM32, IBM36-IBM38, IBM42, IBM44-IBM46); Controls (C122, C754, C855, C906, C1015, C1042); GenBank caucasians (G1-G87, G100, G101, G103, G106-G116); GenBank noncaucasians (G88-G99, G102, G104, G105). non-caucasian sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis carried a C at this position. Investigation of a further 26 random African mtDNA sequences from GenBank showed that the 16311C variant occurred in 22 sequences (data not shown). This suggests that the 16311T variant may have arisen in caucasians during evolutionary divergence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Frequency of the 16311C variant in IBM and AD</head><p>The frequency of the 16311C variant in patients with IBM was compared to that in patients with AD (n 35, mean age 79.5 ^7.1 years; range 65±94 years) and control subjects (n 52, mean age 68.3 ^14.2 years; range 40±92 years). An additional three patients with IBM (mean age for n 37 was 70.9 ^9.5 years; range 47±87 years) were also analyzed using the ARMS assay. The frequency of the 16311C variant was greater in IBM than in AD or controls (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) when the total IBM group was considered (P 0:03) but this increased frequency was not statistically signi®cant when only the caucasian patients (n 34) were considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>IBM and AD share several pathological features and the possibility of a common predisposing element has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Both are complex diseases whose development is probably multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Identi®cation of ragged red ®bres with de®cient COX activity in muscle of patients with IBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> and COX defects in various tissues from patients with AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> have suggested that defects in mitochondrial metabolism may play a role in the development of both diseases. Mutations in the mitochondrial genome have been shown to be responsible for mitochondrial malfunction in several diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Several mutations, either inherited <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> or somatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> have been described in AD. The most frequent mtDNA mutation reported in AD is that at nucleotide 4336, which substitutes a G for an A in a region which codes for tRNA Gln and has been associated with lateonset AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. This association has been subject to some debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In this study the frequencies of the 4336G and 4580A variants in patients with AD and IBM were not signi®cantly higher than those in control subjects. The low frequencies of these variants observed in AD and IBM argue against a major role for these mutations in predisposing to these diseases. It is possible, however, that these variants increase the risk of AD by acting in concert with other genetic and environmental factors.</p><p>The evolutionary relationship between the mitochondrial genomes of unrelated individuals has been analysed by comparison of their D-loop region <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. For example, the common ancestry of individuals with the 4336A mutation (either AD or control) was demonstrated by comparing D-loop sequences and demonstrating that all individuals with the mutation clustered together on a single branch of the phylogenetic tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. We have conducted such an analysis of our patients with IBM based on the hypothesis that if a genetic defect in mtDNA was common to all patients with IBM then this would be, in effect, in linkage Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Model of clonal linkage of variants to D-loop polymorphisms (modi®ed from Hutchin and Cortopassi <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). Variants like 4336G and 4580A, shown as a black ellipse, occur in a distinct mtDNA, which are then inherited along the lineage. These recent mutations are inherited in linkage with certain ancestral polymorphisms in the D-loop. However mtDNAs bearing the ancestral polymorphism do not necessarily carry the recent mutation.</p><p>disequilibrium with a common sequence in the D-loop. Thus, such an analysis would result in the clustering of all patients with IBM on one branch of the phylogenetic tree.</p><p>Samples with the 4336G variant clustered together as expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Interestingly, samples with the 4580A variant also clustered together. Both of these mutations were shown to correlate with polymorphisms in the Dloop. However, not all samples with a C at np 16304 harboured the 4336G transition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Similarly, not all samples with a C at np 16298 carried the 4580A variant. This could be easily explained by the process of evolution. When a non-lethal mutation occurs, it is forever linked to the clonal background on which it arose until its extinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Thus, individuals with this mutation share a common clonal background. On the other hand, not all individuals from the same clonal background will carry the mutation (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Nevertheless, the mtDNA D-loop sequence is a good indication of known mutations in the coding region and this could be a useful tool for identifying possible disease lineages.</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis of our panel of patients with IBM revealed an interesting ®nding. There was a clustering of a group of individuals with IBM, all of which were found to carry a C at np 16311. Ten of these were grouped in one region of the phylogenetic tree. Three other patients with the 16311C variant were located elsewhere in the tree. Their position was in¯uenced by the presence of a second sequence variant in the D-loop. When taken together the frequency of the 16311C variant in IBM was higher than that in either AD or controls. Although a speci®c polymorphism in the D-loop region is not invariably linked to a particular mutation in the coding region, the high frequency of this variant in patients with IBM may indicate a common abnormality in a subgroup of patients which contributes to the high frequency of mtDNA deletions seen in IBM. Tandem duplications in the D-loop have previously been reported to be associated with deletions in mtDNA in some patients with mitochondrial myopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Clearly not all individuals with the 16311C variant develop s-IBM. Thus its interaction with other genetic factors may be important in disease development <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. For example it is possible that a mtDNA haplotype marked by the 16311C variant exacerbates the effects of an HLA-DR3 associated genetic factor that is very strongly associated with IBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. All of the patients with the 16311C variant, including the three of non-caucasoid background, were HLA-DR3 positive. Further studies are required to elucidate any interaction of these genetic markers in IBM.</p><p>The data presented here support the previously reported clustering of individuals with the 4336G variant, and further demonstrate clustering of individuals with the 4580A variant. Therefore phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA Dloop may be a valuable starting point in screening for common disease mutations which are inherited through evolution. We have shown that a group of patients with s-IBM clustered together and shared the 16311C variant in the D-loop. This ®nding warrants further screening for a corresponding mutation in the coding region of the mtDNA.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
