<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Inclusion-body myositis (IBM) is the most common progressive muscle disease of persons over age 50, and no successful treatment is available. Its cause and pathogenesis are unknown (reviewed in Refs 1, 2). Muscle biopsies of IBM patients show vacuolated muscle fibers, atrophic muscle fibers and various degrees of lymphocytic inflammation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Within IBM vacuolated muscle fibers, there is a unique combination of features (reviewed in Refs 1, 2), including pathological accumulations of the following: ␤APP, including ␤-amyloid protein (A␤); 3 751-␤APP mRNA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> several other proteins that are also accumulated in Alzheimer brain; 1,2 and congophilic amyloid. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Electron microscopy (EM) reveals characteristic features of IBM muscle fibers, including cytoplasmic clusters of 6-10 nm filaments containing A␤, 3 cytoplasmic 15-21 nm paired helical filaments (PHFs) containing hyperphosphorylatedtau, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> 15-21 nm tubulofilamentous inclusions (which are actually PHFs and are evident in favorable sections) in 3-4% of the nuclei, and abnormal mitochondria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Abnormal accumulation of ␤APP epitopes, including A␤, might play a major role in the pathogenesis of IBM, since that often precedes other abnormalities, including congophilia and vacuolization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> A major pathogenic role for A␤ has been also proposed in Alzheimer disease (see Refs 6, 7). However, the actual consequences of ␤APP overexpression and the sequence of events in the pathogenic cascade are not understood in either disease. Because over-expression of both the ␤APP gene and ␤APP protein has been demonstrated in biopsied muscle fibers of IBM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> we asked whether overproduction of ␤APP in previously normal muscle is sufficient to cause some of the typical morphological aspects of the IBM phenotype, including the intracellular congophilia. We therefore transferred cDNA encoding 751-␤APP into well differentiated cultured normal adult human muscle fibers utilizing an adenovirus vector. Our initial observations were that ␤APP gene transfer into cultured normal human muscle causes deficiency of cytochrome-c oxidase and structural mitochondrial abnormalities. 8</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>Two recombinant replication-deficient adenoviruses containing the ␤APP gene in sense and antisense orientation were constructed as described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> In brief, pACCMVpLpA was prepared by modifying the pAC vector, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> accomplished by replacing a region of the adenovirus genome between map units 1.3 and 9.1 with the cytomegalovirus (CMV) early promoter. A cloning cassette was also inserted immediately downstream from the CMV promoter, followed by a fragment of the simian virus 40 genome that included the small t-antigen intron and the polyadenylation signal. A 3 kb human ␤APP cDNA encoding ␤APP-751 containing the KPI insert <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> was inserted into pACCMVpLpA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Neuroscience and Neuropathology</head><p>Two recombinant viruses were then obtained by co-transfection of 293 cells (AdE1A-transformed human embryonic kidney cells) with appropriate pACCMVpLpA plasmids and pJM17 plasmid. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> The PJM17 plasmid encodes a full-length adenovirus-5 genome interrupted by the insertion of the bacterial plasmid pBRX at position 3.7 map units, allowing one to exceed the packaging limit for adenovirus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Homologous recombination in 293 cells between the pJM17 plasmid and the recombinant pACCMVpLpA-␤APP and pACCMV-␣␤APP (␤APP cDNA in antisense orientation) generated two replication-deficient viruses, which were carrying ␤APP cDNA in sense and antisense orientation. The presence of these DNAs was confirmed by Southern blotting. Viruses were amplified by growth in 293 cells. The appropriate viral plaques were expanded and purified and were stored at -20°C.</p><p>Purified human muscle cultures were established, according to our previously reported technique (reviewed in Ref. 13), from satellite cells of portions of diagnostic muscle biopsies (obtained with informed consent) from 20 patients who were considered free of muscle disease after all tests were performed. In our system, aneurally cultured human muscle achieves advanced maturation and can be maintained for 2 months or longer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> Muscle fibers cultured for 2 weeks (i.e. 5-7 days after myoblast fusion) were infected with ␤APPadenovirus at doses ranging from 1.5 ϫ 10 8 to 0.3 ϫ 10 8 p.f.u./ml of culture medium. Concurrent controls were uninfected sister cultures and sister cultures infected with adenovirus carrying antisense ␤APP-cDNA, adenovirus carrying the ␤-galactosidase gene, and replication-deficient recombinant 'wild' adenovirus vector composed of the same plasmids as the ␤APP-adenovirus but not carrying any foreign cDNA other than the CMV promoter gene and the SV40 polyadenylation signal ('empty' adenovirus). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Uninfected sister cultures were also treated with conditioned medium from cultures infected with ␤APP-adenovirus. Previously we showed by Northern blots, immunoblots, in situ hybridization, and immunocytochemistry that adenovirus-mediated ␤APP-gene transfer into cultured normal human muscle results in strong over-expression of the ␤APP gene and protein, which typically lasts several weeks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Three to five weeks after ␤APP gene transfer, ␤APP-over-expressing and control cultures were processed for EM as described previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> Fluorescence immunocytochemistry and EM gold immunolocalization of A␤ were performed according to our methods, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> using rabbit polyclonal antiserum 1280 against A␤, 15 diluted 1:200. Congo-red staining was visualized by our fluorescence-enhanced method, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> 3-7 weeks following ␤APP gene-transfer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>There was a dose-dependent cytopathic effect of the transferred ␤APP gene. Doses of 1.5 ϫ 10 8 and 1 ϫ 10 8 p.f.u./ml of ␤APP-adenovirus caused pronounced vacuolization of muscle fibers and their degeneration within 3-5 days and 8-12 days, respectively, after infection. Smaller doses of 0.5 or 0.3 ϫ 10 8 p.f.u./ml, also produced vacuolation and degeneration of most of the muscle fibers (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>), but not until 3-5 weeks after ␤APP gene transfer. The dose of 0.3 ϫ 10 8 was utilized in the present study.</p><p>The resultant ␤APP-over-expressing cultured muscle fibers, like those in IBM biopsied-muscle, manifested A␤ immunoreactivity in small clusters (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). The sister cultured muscle fibers in all of the control groups appeared healthy, cross-striated, and without vacuoles (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>) or A␤ immunoreactivity (Fig. <ref type="figure">1D</ref>). In ␤APP-over-expressing cultured muscle fibers, EM-immunochemistry localized the A␤ in 6-10 nm diameter filaments and small amorphous foci (Fig. <ref type="figure">1E</ref>), as in IBM biopsied muscle. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Five to six weeks after ␤APP gene transfer, 5-8% of the very abnormal muscle fibers of ␤APP-overexpressing cultures contained small congophilic inclusions (Fig. <ref type="figure">1F</ref>) similar to some of the congophilic inclusions in IBM biopsied muscle fibers (Fig. <ref type="figure">1G</ref>). Three weeks after ␤APP gene transfer, cultured muscle fibers showed EM abnormalities identical to those present in biopsied IBM fibers, including clusters of 6-10 nm diameter filaments in about 60% of the cultured fibers (Fig. <ref type="figure">1H</ref>; cf. 1I); myelin-like whorls within the vacuoles (Fig. <ref type="figure">1J</ref>; cf 1K); nuclear 15-21 nm diameter tubulofilamentous inclusions in 6-8% of the cultured muscle fiber nuclei (Fig. <ref type="figure">1L</ref>; cf. 1M,N; cf. 1O); and dense cytoplasmic bodies in 25% of the cultured fibers (not shown). The magnitude of the abnormalities correlated with the duration of ␤APP-gene over-expression. These changes were not caused by the adenovirus per se since there were no morphological abnormalities like those evident with the sense-␤APP gene in control cultures infected with 'empty' adenovirus vector or with adenovirus carrying either the ␤APP gene in antisense orientation or the ␤-galactosidase gene.</p><p>The cytoplasmic 15-21 nm paired helical filaments (PHFs) typical of IBM have not yet been observed in the ␤APP-over-expressing cultured muscle.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>IBM is probably a multifactorial disease, the direct cause of which is not known. The etiologic factor might be related to a virus, and/or a dysimmune mechanism, or possibly another cause, but none has been proven. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Aging factors may be an important component. The chain of events leading to the specific vacuolar muscle degeneration, including pathologic accumulation of characteristic proteins, cytoskeletal disorganization, and muscle fiber atrophy, is not known. Increased ␤APP-mRNA and increased accumulation of ␤APP epitopes appear to precede other abnormalities in IBM muscle fibers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> This study provides the evidence that over-production of ␤APP within cultured human muscle fibers is sufficient to induce several aspects of the IBM muscle phenotype. It suggests that upstream overexpressed ␤APP might be an important step in the pathogenic cascade of IBM. We do not yet know whether the observed abnormalities are caused by the whole ␤APP molecule, or by intracellularly increased A␤ or another ␤APP fragment.</p><p>Our most recent studies (in progress) show that the ␤APP-over-expressing cultures secrete into the medium much larger amounts of A␤ 1-40 than do controls, and they also secrete a substantial, but lesser, amount of A␤ 1-42 (while in control cultures A␤ 1-42 secretion is below the level of detection) (Xie, McFerrin, Engel, Selkoe and Askanas, preliminary studies, 1997). From this, one can infer that in our ␤APP-over-expressing cultured muscle fibers there is a prominently increased intracellular production of A␤ 1-40 and A␤ 1-42 , providing more precursor for aggregation into the observed A␤-containing 6-10 nm intracellular amyloid fibrils, particularly the A␤ 1-42 , which is considered more fibrillogenic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Even though the conditioned medium did not induce abnormality in cultured normal-control human muscle we do not know whether there is a co-pathogenic role of the excessively secreted A␤ 1-40 and 1-42 acting extracellularly on the cultured muscle fibers that are themselves abnormal by virtue of their over-expressing ␤APP.</p><p>Our model enables long-term culturing of adult human skeletal muscle, the tissue affected by the IBM disease process, making possible sequential studies of changes consequent to the overexpression of ␤APP; analysis of the proposed role of ␤APP-induced oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of IBM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and manipulations designed to augment detrimental effects of excess ␤APP or to 'therapeutically' mitigate them.  General Summary ␤-Amyloid precursor protein (␤APP) and its derivative ␤-amyloid protein (A␤) are considered key factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A␤ is a major component of amyloid fibrils in extracellular senile plaques of Alzheimer disease (AD) brain. Whereas previously the pathologic accumulation of A␤ was considered confined to the brain of AD patients, it has recently been demonstrated that in a muscle disease, inclusion body myositis (IBM), common in persons over age 50, there are within the vacuolated muscle fibers abnormal accumulations of A␤, two other ␤APP epitopes, and ␤APP mRNA. Those muscle fibers also express several other 'Alzheimer-characteristic' proteins and congophilic material. Our current study provides the first evidence that direct transfer of a ␤APP gene into cultured normal human muscle, using recombinant adenovirus vector, is sufficient to induce several of the typical light-microscopic, electron microscopic and EM-immunochemical aspects of IBM, including congophilia, clusters of A␤-positive 6-10 nm diameter filaments, and nuclear inclusions of 15-21 nm diameter tubulofilaments. Because both IBM and AD occur in aging tissues, muscle and brain respectively, similar abnormal cellular mechanisms may be responsible for susceptibility to the yet-unknown early etiopathogenic events and downstream consequences of ␤APP over-expression in the pathologic cascade. This new culture model will be useful to study, in the type of tissue affected by the IBM disease process, namely adult human muscle fibers, various factors that might either augment detrimental effects of excessive ␤APP, or therapeutically mitigate them. Discovered beneficial factors might them be applied to the IBM patients.
