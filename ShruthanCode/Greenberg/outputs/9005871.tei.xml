<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Serum from 70 patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) was subjected to agarose gel immunofixation electrophoresis. The IgG extracted from 9 patients with monoclonal proteins, 3 without, and 2 control subjects and was purified, biotinylated, and applied to muscle biopsy sections for immunocytochemistry and to purified muscle protein fractions for immunoblots. Sixteen of 70 (22.8%) patients with IBM, compared with 2% of agematched controls, had a monoclonal gammopathy characterized as IgGh in 9 patients, IgGK in 4, IgMK in 2, and IgAA in 1. The mean age o f IBM patients with gammopathy was 60.6 years (range, 35-77 year&amp; compared with 66.1 years (range, 42-80 years) of the IBM patients without gammopathy. The IgG of the patients, more often than that of the control subjects, immunostained myonuclei and recognized various muscle proteins of 35 to 145 kd. We conclude that IBM, regardless of age, is frequently associated with monoclonal gammopathies, which often recognize various muscle components, especially myonuclei, suggesting disturbed immunoregulation.</p></div>

All patients admitted to the Neuromuscular Diseases Section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, had a diagnostic muscle biopsy, complete blood chemistry, hematology profile, screening for various autoantibodies, quantitative immunoglobulins, and serum protein electrophoresis. After excluding familial cases and patients with a coexisting autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency, or malignancy, a total of 70 patients with bona fide sporadic IBM were studied. The frequency of monoclonal gammopathies in age-matched populations, without neuropathy, was calculated in 80 randomly chosen patients with various neuromuscular diseases including postpolio syndrome, dermatomyositis, and amyo-trophic lateral sclerosis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>An increased frequency (up to 22.7%) of monoclonal gammopathy was seen in patients with sporadic IBM. The association is not coincidental or age related because (1) the series of screened patients was large; (2) the age of IBM patients with gammopathy was lower than those without; (3) there was no other associated condition to explain it; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>  dyscrasic amyloidosis <ref type="bibr">[12, 131.</ref> There were no signs, however, to suggest that the IgG was amyloidogenic because it did not bind to the intracellular amyloid deposits (not shown). Further, the incidence of amyloid within the vacuolated fibers seen in IBM patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, was the same in patients with or without gammopathies.</p><p>The binding of the IgG to myonuclei, observed even in the 1BM patients without gammopathies, was not artifactual because it was noted immunocytochemically with the purified IgG, and not with the whole serum, which may bind nonspecifically to and around muscle fibers. Further, with western blots on nuclear extracts, binding was much more frequent with the sera of IBM patients compared with that of the paraproteinemic neuropathy controls (see Table <ref type="table">)</ref>, supporting the reported observation that paraproteins do not have high incidence of antinuclear or anti-DNA autoantibody binding activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This is also consistent with our finding of antinuclear antibodies in only 2 of 11 IBM patients with gammopathy. The immunoglobulin of the IBM patients recognized, in addition to nuclei, cytoplasmic antigens (see Table <ref type="table">)</ref>, probably due to incomplete separation of the various organelles in the extracted cellular fractions or due to contamination of the contiguous cytomembranes by nuclear contents dis- tern is connected with the T cell-mediated and MHC-I class restricted immunopathologic process observed in these patients' muscles [3, 41. A primary involvement of the nuclei has been implicated in IBM patients on the basis of cDNA probes deposited on the myonuclei [ 161. Further, accumulation of tubulofilaments within the myonuclei bursting into the cytoplasm is commonly seen in the disease. If IBM begins from the myonuclei, as suggested <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>, it is possible that nuclear proteins released in the cytoplasm and the membrane may serve as self-antigens bound to MHC-I antigen for presentation to CD8' T cells.</p><p>Although the association of IBM with a monoclonal gammopathy does not define a clinicopathologically distinct subset, it suggests that in some patients there is disturbed immune regulation resulting in B-cell activation. The observations support the view that autoimmune processes may be common in IBM patients. Although autosomal recessive and X-linked inheritance have been reported, the autosomal dominant form, for which two loci have been identified, is predominant. CMTlA, which is the most frequent, is linked to the chromosome 17~11.2, whereas CMT1B is caused by the gene coding for the myelin protein PO, which is located on chromosome lp22 <ref type="bibr">[3-71.</ref> In most cases, CMTIA is associated with a duplication of the 1.5-Mb region in 1 7 ~1 1 . 2 18-10] that contains the gene coding for peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), in which mutations are found in CMTlA patients without duplications [I 1, 121. It has been hypothesized that increased dosage of the PMP22 gene is the cause of the CMTlA associated with the 1 7 ~1 1 . 2 duplication 1131. The observation of a more severe phenotype in a single homozygote for the 1 7 ~1 1 . 2 duplication supported this hypothesis [8, 141, and suggested that CMTlA with duplication was a semidominant disease.</p><p>We performed a clinical, electrophysiological, and genetic study of a consanguinous CMTl family with 4 affected siblings, 3 of whom were homozygous for the 17p 1 1.2 duplication and 1 was heterozygous. Comparison of their phenotypes showed that the severity of the disease was variable among the homozygotes, 1 of whom was not more severely affected than the heterozygous sibling who was paucisymptomatic. These results suggest that the severity of the disease is determined not only by the number of copies of the PMP22 gene. All patients but 1 (Patient 6) were examined a second time, after a 3-year interval. Age at onset and filnctional disability were determined from clinical histories. Deep tendon reflexes as well as motor and sensory functions were explored in the four limbs. Amyotrophy, pes caws, and nerve hypertrophy were systematically searched for.</p></div>

Clinical severity is extremely variable: Some affected subjects remain asymptomatic their whole lives, while others have severe footdrop and foot deformities, or are even confined to wheelchairs. In contrast, all gene carriers, symptomatic or not, show markedly reduced nerve conduction velocities.
