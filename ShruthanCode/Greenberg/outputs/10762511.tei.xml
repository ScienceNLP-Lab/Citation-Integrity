Dalakas, MD</p><p>Article abstract-Objective: To examine the origin of hyperphosphorylated proteins within the vacuolated myofibers in sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) and search for dysregulated intracellular protein phosphorylation. Background: s-IBM is morphologically characterized by primary endomysial inflammation and vacuolated myofibers containing tubulofilaments that originate from cytoskeletal proteins. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play a role in regulating phosphorylation and maintaining the stability of the cytoskeletal architecture. Methods: Muscle biopsies from seven patients with s-IBM and 15 controls were examined for the expression of the active components of the various MAPKs, including p44/42MAPK, p38MAPK, p46JNK1, p54JNK2, and p54JNK3, using immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. The expression of selected phosphorylated components was also examined in the same specimens. Results: In s-IBM, but not the disease controls, the vacuolated muscle fibers express active p42MAPK but not JNK or p38MAPK. Western blots of cell lysates confirmed the hyperexpression of p42MAPK and demonstrated a novel 35 kD phosphoprotein. Antibodies against phosphoepitopes of the 35 kD protein preferentially immunostained antigens within the vacuolated muscle fibers of s-IBM but not disease controls. Conclusion: In s-IBM, there is increased p42MAPK activation and abnormal intracellular protein phosphorylation with selective accumulation of a 35 kD phosphoprotein within the vacuolated fibers. Although the hyperexpression of 35kD protein may represent cytoskeletal by-products due to heightened p42MAPK activation, its abundant expression only in s-IBM implies that hyperphosphorylated myofibrillar proteins may be involved in the primary disease process. Key words: Muscle mitogen-activated protein kinase-Sporadic inclusion body myositis.</p><p>NEUROLOGY 2000;54:1665-1669</p><p>Sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) is the most common inflammatory myopathy in patients older than 50 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The morphologic hallmarks of s-IBM include primary endomysial inflammation and vacuolated myofibers containing tubulofilaments that immunoreact for ␤-amyloid precursor protein, apolipoprotein E, hyperphosphorylated microtubuleassociated protein (MAP) tau, and ubiquitin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> Although these tubulofilaments <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and hyperphosphorylated MAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> appear to originate from cyto-skeletal components, it is not known if their accumulation reflects a disturbance of intracellular coordinated phosphorylation. This is fundamental because disturbance in coordinated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, such as amino acid substitutions of conserved serine phosphorylation sites in myosin regulatory light chain, have resulted in impaired muscle function and myopathy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Further, regulated phosphorylation of structure proteins in muscle cells is essential in maintaining the stability of cytoskeletal architecture and modulating the dynamics of polymerization and reorganization of myofibrils in both physiologic and pathologic conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a group of serine/threonine specific kinases that play a pivotal role in mediating signal transduction from cell surface to either nucleus or cytoskeleton. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Upon phosphorylation at both tyrosine and threonine residues by corresponding kinases, they become activated, resulting in further phosphorylation of structure proteins and transcription factors. One of the MAPK pathways involves the p44/42MAPK, which is highly expressed in the mammalian nervous system and the skeletal muscle. A significant proportion of p44/42MAPK binds to microtubules and plays an important role in the regulation of structure and function of cytoskeletal proteins upon mitogen stimulation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> Although regulated activation and inactivation of p42MAPK is crucial in the early stages of myogenesis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> the role of p42MAPK activation in postmitotic human skeletal myofibers is unclear. The other two prominent members of MAPK are the p38MAPK and c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK), which mediate overlapping, yet distinct, signals with p44/p42MAPK.</p><p>To study the myofiber response to undefined cellular insults and gain insight into the mechanism underlying morphologic changes seen in s-IBM, we looked for the expression of active components of MAPKs and searched for dysregulated intracellular protein phosphorylation in the muscle biopsy specimens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods.</head><p>We studied muscle biopsy specimens from seven patients, 50 to 70 years old, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of s-IBM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Most of these patients had participated in previous studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and had an indolent onset of proximal and distal muscle weakness with a steadily progressive course. Their muscle biopsy specimens had endomysial inflammation and several vacuolated fibers per low (200 ϫ magnification) field. For disease controls, we used 15 muscle biopsies from 1) two patients with vacuolar myopathy due to phosphofructokinase deficiency; 2) seven patients with inflammatory myopathy other than s-IBM (two polymyositis, two dermatomyositis, three HIV myositis characterized by endomysial inflammation identical to polymyositis, mitochondrial abnormalities due to zidovudine toxicity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and minivacuolar formation); 3) two patients with denervation characterized by group atrophy and fiber type grouping; 4) one patient with morphologically nonspecific myopathy; and 5) three muscle biopsies with normal morphology from subjects without a muscle disorder. All specimens were processed for immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis as follows.</p><p>Immunocytochemistry. Immunocytochemistry was performed in a conventional indirect immunofluorescence technique, as described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> In brief, 6-m-thick serial cryosections were fixed in acetone and incubated at 4 °C overnight with rabbit polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies (Vector Laboratory) and peroxidase conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratory). Enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham; Piscataway, NJ) was used for detection of the immunoreactive bands.</p><p>Results. Expression of active p44/42MAPK. In s-IBM, the active p44/42 MAPK was strongly expressed within the muscle fibers that contained vacuoles (figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). The staining was mostly within and surrounding the vacuoles and weakly within some regenerating/degenerating fibers (see figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). There was little or no immunoreactivity of active p44/42MAPK in the muscle fibers of other vacuolar myopathies (see figure <ref type="figure">1C</ref>) or the normal controls. Among the controls, only some degenerating/regenerating muscle fibers showed immunoreactivity to active p44/42MAPK (see figure <ref type="figure">1D</ref>). Antibodies against the active p38MAPK or active JNK showed weak or no immunoreactivity within the muscle fibers in all the specimens, without differences between s-IBM or controls (data not shown).</p><p>Western blot analysis of cell lysates of the same muscle biopsy specimens showed increased immunoreactivity for the active p42MAPK in s-IBM (lane 2, figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>, and lanes 1 through 3, figure <ref type="figure">2C</ref>) compared with controls (lanes 3 and 4, figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>; lane 4, figure <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). The monoclonal antibody p-JNK (G-7) did not recognize the active JNK in the studied muscles (see figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>, lanes 2 through 4), but it did stain the active p46JNK1 from the EGF-treated PC12 cells that we used as a positive control (arrow; lane 1, figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>). The expression of active p38MAPK was variable among all the studied specimens by Western blot analysis and not consistently increased in a specific disease (data not shown).</p><p>Expression of a 35 kD phosphoprotein. Because many of the cytoskeletal proteins of the myofibers contain phosphoserine, we examined the pattern of phosphoserine immunoreactivity on immunoblots using the polyclonal antibody against phosphoserine in the cell lysates of all the biopsied muscle samples. As shown in figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, a strong anti-phosphoserine-reactive band, corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of 35 kD, was noted in the muscle specimens of s-IBM compared with a very weak reaction in the other controls (in figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, the arrow shows the band from two of seven representative patients with s-IBM [lanes 1 and 2]; lanes 3 and 4 are other representative</p></div>

Polyclonal antibody against phospho-specific p44/42MAPK was applied in an indirect immunofluorescence technique.

This 35 kD protein is heavily phosphorylated on the serine residues as it constitutes a major portion of phosphoserine-containing protein in the whole cell lysate.</p><p>Deposits of phosphoproteins within the myofibers of s-IBM. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies against phosphoserine showed discrete accumulations of phosphoserine-containing proteins within the vacuolated myofibers (figure <ref type="figure">4A</ref>). Some weak staining in the periphery of the fiber was also noted. In contrast, little or no phosphoserine immunoreactivity within the muscle fibers was noted in the other myopathies (figure <ref type="figure">4B</ref>).</p><p>Discussion. Within the vacuolated muscle fibers of patients with s-IBM, but not the other vacuolar or inflammatory myopathies, we found hyperexpression of active p42MAPK, suggesting heightened p42MAPK activation cascade. Given the abundance of the 35 kD phosphoprotein analyzed by Western blotting and its specific localization seen by immuno-cytochemistry, it is very likely that the 35 kD phosphoprotein may originate from the cytoskeleton. The high expression of the 35 kD phosphoprotein within the muscle fibers of s-IBM may be due either to its hyperphosphorylation on multiple serine residues at post-translational level or potentially to upregulation at transcriptional level by the p42MAPK activation. Because both the 35 kD phosphoprotein and the active p42MAPK were hyperexpressed within the vacuolated muscle fibers only in s-IBM but not the other vacuolar myopathies, the abnormal phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins is probably connected to the underlying cause of s-IBM and may not be a nonspecific consequence of the vacuolar formation or a cytoskeletal by-product of the heightened p42MAPK activation. In addition to the 35 kD protein, other phosphoproteins were upregulated in the diseased muscles compared with the subjects, but they did not correlate to a specific disease process.</p><p>In cycling cells such as fibroblasts, or postmitotic cells such as neurons and myofibers, a significant proportion of p42MAPK is physically associated with microtubules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> MAP-2, MAP-4, and tau are the substrates of p44/42MAPK, and prolonged activation of p42MAPK has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurofibrillar tangle formation and tau hyperphosphorylation in neurodegenerative disorders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> Because in adult skeletal muscle the microtubules are essential in maintaining the highly organized structure of the sarcomere and the assembly of the thick filaments, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> the hyperexpression of active p42MAPK in s-IBM and the selective accumulation of phosphoproteins within the vacuolated fibers suggest an ongoing cytoskeletal disruption with intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated microtubular proteins. An example of vacuolar formation due to instability of cytoskeletal architecture in the muscle is the vacuolar myopathy due to myotoxic effects of colchicine. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> In physiologic conditions, active p44/42MAPK can promote cell growth, which may account for the increased expression of the active p44/42MAPK we noted in regenerating muscle fibers in patients with s-IBM or polymyositis. Dysregulated MAPK pathway, conversely, may be connected to cell degeneration. Although the intracellular and extracellular</p></div>
