<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The genetic predisposition to inclusion body myositis (IBM) is probably multifactorial. The deposition of the P-amyloid protein is a characteristic histological feature of both IBM and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ~4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APO E) has been strongly associated with familial and late-onset AD. We therefore compared the APO E allele frequencies in a group of 14 patients with IBM with those in a group of patients with other inflammatory muscle diseases and in the general population. The frequency of the ~4 allele in IBM was increased (0.29) compared with that in patients with other inflammatory muscle diseases (0.15) and the general population (0.13) ( p &lt; 0.05). These data suggest that APO E genotype may be one of the factors involved in determining the predisposition to the development of IBM.</p></div>

DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using standard phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol techniques. APO E genotyping was performed at the Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Royal Perth Hospital, using a previously described technique 1171 based upon amplification of the gene by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by digestion of the PCR product with the restriction endonuclease HhaI and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In this way three alleles can be detected, ie, ~2 , ~3 , and ~4 . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The APO E genotypes of the individual patients with IBM are shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The frequency of the ~4 allele in IBM was twice that seen in the healthy population (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>) and this increase remained significant ( p &lt; 0.05) even when Subject 11 was excluded from the analysis. No significant increase in ~4 frequency was demonstrable in a similar number of patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>). The presence of the ~4 allele was not related to the age of onset or severity of disease at presentation. Six of the 9 men with IBM had ~4 (allele frequency = 0.39) but only 1 of 5 women did (allele frequency = 0.10).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The mechanism responsible for the deposition of AP and the other proteins that comprise the inclusion bodies of IBM, and their role in the pathogenesis of the disease are unknown. The similarity in protein content between these inclusions and the amyloid-containing The data presented here differ from those derived from a recent study of 11 patients with IBM 1191 in which a small but statistically insignificant increase in ~4 was reported. This difference may reflect the small numbers of patients in each study but could also reflect genetic heterogeneity in this disease. The genetic predisposition to the development of IBM is probably multifactorial. We have recently demonstrated that more than 90% of patients with IBM bear the human leukocyte (HLA) antigen DR3 and virtually all patients had a deletion of at least one of the genes encoding complement factor 4 that are present in the major histocompatibility complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20)</ref>. This very strong HLA association with IBM provides some support for an autoimmune mechanism in this disease. The relationship between the inclusion bodies and the lymphocytic infiltrate is unclear. Whether the T cells that accumulate in these lesions are directed at proteins represented in the inclusion bodies, including AP, is unknown. The association with ~4 is less striking than the HLA association and requires confirmation. Nevertheless, the frequency of this allele in IBM approaches that seen in AD (0.33-0.41) G9-13, 18, 191. However, a significant proportion of patients are negative for the ~4 allele in both diseases, emphasizing the likelihood that alternate factors may contribute to the development of the characteristic pathology seen in these diseases.</p><p>Despite the clear evidence that ~4 is a predisposing factor to the development of AD, its precise role in the pathogenesis of the disease is unknown. It has been proposed that the increased rate of binding of AP by APO E4 may play a role in its increased deposition 113, 141. In addition, the decreased binding of APO E4 to the 7 protein may increase the rate of development of neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. A role of APO E4 in IBM is also unclear. APO E performs a number of functions apart from its role in lipid redistribution between and within tissues. For example, it has been implicated in the process of nerve regeneration and repair and in smooth muscle proliferation and differentiation, although a role in skeletal muscle metabolism has not been defined [21). It is interesting that APO E is believed to be capable of modulating T-lymphocyte activation by mitogens or antigen [21}. Since IBM is characterized by the intramuscular accumulation of T lymphocytes and macrophages, the latter cell type being a potent producer of APO E, a role in the immune response to muscle cannot be excluded. O n the other hand, APO E4 may play a role in facilitating the deposition of excess A@ in skeletal muscle, thus contributing to ultimate muscle cell degeneration. The demonstration of increased levels of mRNA encoding @-APP (suggesting overproduction of @-APP) and the demonstration of APO E in the inclusions of IBM [G, 7) are consistent with this possibility.</p><p>This study was supported by grants from the Australian Neuromuscular Research Institute, The National Health and Medical Research Council o f Australia, and the Arthritis Foundation of Western Australia.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_2"><head>Table I .</head><label>I</label><figDesc>Patients with Inclu.rion Body Myositirplaques of AD is remarkable.
