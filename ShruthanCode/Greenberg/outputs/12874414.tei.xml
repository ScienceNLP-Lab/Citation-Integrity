<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM), the most common progressive muscle disease of older persons, is of unknown etiology and pathogenesis. Characteristic features of the s-IBM muscle biopsy are vacuolated muscle fibers containing Congo red-positive amyloid inclusions and various degrees of lymphocytic inflammation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Morphologic abnormalities within s-IBM muscle fibers exhibit many similarities to Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, including accumulations of the cytotoxic amyloid ␤-peptide (A␤), clusters of tau-containing paired helical filaments, and a dozen other proteins accumulated in AD brain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> In the aging cellular environment, the intra-muscle fiber increase of A␤ has been considered upstream to other cellular abnormalities of the s-IBM pathogenic cascade. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> We postulated that s-IBM is a multifactorial disease in which susceptibility genes, possibly together with predisposing environmental factors, play an important pathogenetic role. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Recently, we reported a 70-year-old African-American man with s-IBM and cardiac amyloidosis associated with the Val122Ile transthyretin (TTR) mutation, 2 typically autosomal dominant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> In addition to the features of s-IBM, his muscle biopsy contained 1) numerous intra-muscle fiber plaquettes of congophilic amyloid composed of both TTR and A␤ 2 and 2) muscle blood vessel extracellular amyloid also composed of both TTR and A␤. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Because wild TTR in vitro binds A␤ and prevents its fibrillar amyloidogenesis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> we hypothesized that, conversely, mutant TTR may promote A␤ deposition and amyloidogenesis, thereby facilitating development of IBM. To test this hypothesis, we cultured our patient's muscle biopsy and transferred into his cultured muscle fibers (CMF) the 751 amyloid ␤ precursor protein gene (A␤PP) gene, seeking whether their intrinsic TTR mutation will facilitate their development of the IBM phenotype. We previously reported that transfer of the A␤PP gene into human normal CMF produced some aspects of the IBM phenotype, including accumulation of A␤-immunoreactive inclusions and rare congophilia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Materials and methods. Muscle cultures. Human muscle was cultured in monolayer from satellite cells of portions of diagnostic muscle biopsies, per our method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Muscle cultures from the patient's Val122Ile TTR muscle were compared with cultures grown in parallel from muscle biopsies of four age-matched control patients and several previously grown muscles of patients who were considered free of muscle disease after all diagnostic tests were performed.</p><p>A␤PP gene transfer. A 3-kb human 751 A␤PP cDNA was transferred into 2-week-old CMF, using a replication-deficient adenovirus (RDAV) vector at 0.3 ϫ 10 8 pfu/mL of culture medium, as described previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> The same dose of RDAV carrying antisense A␤PP cDNA or the ␤-galactosidase gene and "empty" RDAV without any foreign cDNA other than the CMV promoter gene and the SV40 polyadenylation signal did not induce detected abnormalities in CMF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy, and immuno-electron microscopy. Fluorescence immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy gold immunolocalization were performed per our methods, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> using the well-characterized mouse monoclonal antibody 6E10 against amino acids 1 to 17 of A␤ (Signet, Dedham, MA), diluted 1:200, and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against TTR (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA, and Novocastra, Burlingame, CA), diluted 1:50 and 1:5, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Congo red staining was visualized with our fluorescence-enhanced method, modified for cultured muscle. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Immunoblots. CMF were lysed in RIPA buffer and protein concentration measured by the Bradford method. Samples were diluted in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and heated 10 minutes at 70 °C, and from each sample, 20 g of protein was loaded onto NuPAGE 12% bis-tris gels (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). After electrophoresis, samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for 1 hour at 30 V in NuPAGE transfer buffer (Invitrogen). Nitrocellulose membranes were probed with 6E10 antibody at 10 g/mL and developed with the Western Breeze anti-mouse chemiluminescent kit (Invitrogen) for film exposure. Protein loading was evaluated with a monoclonal antibody visualizing the ␣-sarcomeric actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results.</head><p>In contrast to the human normal CMF, which survive Ͼ8 weeks and are often cross-striated (figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>), the Val122Ile TTR CMF survived only 2 to 3 weeks owing to their pronounced vacuolar degeneration (see figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>) (data presented are estimates based on our visual inspection of the cultures). Vacuoles were in about 40% of the mutant TTR fibers vs 5% of controls. About 30% of the Val122Ile TTR CMF contained congophilic inclusions (see figure <ref type="figure">1C</ref>) and clusters of colocalizing A␤ and TTR immunoreactivities (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2, A and B</ref>), whereas normal CMF did not contain congophilic or A␤-immunoreactive inclusions (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2C</ref>). In normal CMF, TTR was only very slightly and diffusely immunoreactive (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2D</ref>). By electron microscopy, Val122Ile TTR CMF had 1) with double-immunogold clusters of 6-to 10-nm amyloid-like fibrils and small patches of floccular material, both structures associated with both A␤ and TTR (see figure <ref type="figure">1, D and   E</ref>); 2) abnormal mitochondria; and 3) various lysosomal inclusions (see figure <ref type="figure">1, F and G</ref>).</p><p>Overexpression of A␤PP in the Val122Ile TTR CMF greatly increased the above abnormalities in them, and compared with A␤PP overexpression in human normal CMFs, they had 1) accelerated degeneration (3 vs 9 days); 2) pronounced congophilic amyloid inclusions (in about 60 vs 4% of the fibers) by both light and electron microscopy (not shown); 3) large colocalizing inclusions of A␤ and TTR (in about 80% of the Val122Ile fibers vs A␤ inclusions in about 60% of the normal fibers and no TTR inclusions [only diffuse staining] in them) (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2, E and F</ref>); and 4) vacuoles in about 80 vs 50% of fibers. Those abnormalities were seen in all Val122Ile TTR cultures, both control and A␤PP overexpressing.</p><p>By immunoblots, all identifiable A␤ oligomers were much more abundant in A␤PP-overexpressing Val122Ile TTR CMF compared with A␤PP-overexpressing normal CMF (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion. Our study demonstrates that Val122Ile</head><p>TTR CMF express several aspects of the IBM phenotype, including accumulations of congophilia and A␤. Whereas A␤PP overexpression in normal human CMF leads to some aspects of IBM phenotype, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> those abnormalities were greatly increased when A␤PP was overexpressed in the Val122Ile TTR CMF, especially the accumulation of the presumably cytotoxic A␤ oligomers, including their heavier, probably more aggregated forms.</p></div>

There are clusters of 6-to 10-nm diameter amyloid-like fibrils, "mushy" and vacuolated mitochondria, and various lysosomal inclusions. (E) Double-gold immuno-electron microscopy illustrates that amyloid-␤ (A␤) (10-nm gold particles) and TTR (5-nm gold particles</head><p>) are both associated with intermixed 6-to 10-nm amyloid-like fibrils and with small patches of amorphous floccular material. A to C, ϫ1,100; D ϫ31,000; E, ϫ63,000; F, ϫ46,000; G, ϫ46,000.</p><p>TTR is the major amyloidogenic protein in several forms of amyloidosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> The Val122Ile TTR mutation is the commonest cause of cardiac amyloidosis in African Americans <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and recently was also found in Caucasian patients with cardiac amyloidosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> In Val122Ile TTR patients, extracellular TTR amyloid was in cardiac tissue, blood vessels, and other organs; muscle tissue was not examined, and A␤ was not evaluated. A relationship between the mutant TTR, A␤ accumulation, and s-IBM was previously proposed in our patient, 2 but not proven. The current study provides experimental evidence that, in human muscle, the TTR mutation predisposes to accumulation of A␤ as well as to muscle fiber vacuolation, mitochondrial abnormalities, and decreased viability. The mutant TTR also induced A␤ aggregation and A␤ oligomerization. A␤ oligomers are highly cytotoxic, producing more cellular damage than fully fibrillar A␤. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> In our cultures, the Val122Ile TTR mutation itself was myotoxic, and A␤ and mutant TTR accumulating together were associated with greater toxicity.</p><p>In vitro, wild-type TTR reportedly sequestered A␤ and prevented amyloid fibril formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, wild-type TTR prevented intracellular accumulation of A␤ (referenced in Askanas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> ). Wild-type TTR is increased in the hippocampus of transgenic mice bearing the A␤PP Swedish mutation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> and is postulated to retard neuronal degeneration.</p><p>Our study strongly suggests that in human muscle, the Val122Ile TTR mutation predisposes to A␤ deposition and amyloidogenesis and increases presumably toxic intracellular A␤ oligomers. In our patient with s-IBM and Val122Ile TTR, the TTR mutation could be 1) a genetic predisposition factor for his IBM, triggered by an aging cellular environment and/or other factors; or 2) increasing a pre-existing propensity to have s-IBM and form intra-muscle fiber A␤ deposits.</p><p>We suggest that 1) the IBM histologic and clinical phenotype be sought in other patients with a TTR mutation and 2) TTR mutation/polymorphism be evaluated in patients with sporadic and hereditary IBM.   </p></div>
