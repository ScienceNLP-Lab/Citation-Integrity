<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose of review</head><p>The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) continue to provide a challenge given the variable effectiveness of the available treatments, and immunogenetic studies are ongoing to further elucidate IIM disease mechanisms. This review examines how recent research has improved our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to IIM. Recent findings HLA-DRB1 studies in a large homogenous cohort of UK Caucasian patients have confirmed that polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are not genetically identical diseases while other studies have shown that tumor necrosis factor alpha is genetically implicated in disease susceptibility. Some remarkable results from an international collaboration, correlating gene-environment interactions, clearly suggest that ultraviolet light is capable of modulating both clinical and immunologic features of IIMs. Studies on microchimerism are unraveling interesting associations in juvenile DM patients, and bolstering the hypothesis that myositis may be an 'allo-immune' disease. mRNA gene expression profiling is helping to increase our understanding of myositis pathogenesis, whilst animal models have provided new information on the roles of Th1 responses and nitric oxide synthase in muscle disease. New candidate genes have been examined in inclusion body myositis (IBM), and a novel gene transfer experiment has been conducted, which led to significant changes in expression of the IBM phenotype. Summary Improving the understanding of the immunogenetics and immunopathogenesis of the IIMs may in the future provide novel therapeutic targets, and thus improve outcomes in these difficult diseases.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a heterogeneous group of potentially serious rare diseases, defined by the presence of acquired muscle inflammation and weakness. Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are the subtypes most often seen by rheumatologists. Although corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and intravenous immunoglobulins can all be effective in managing PM/DM, the response to these therapies is variable, and often disappointing. Patients thus occasionally die from their disease, while survivors frequently remain disabled through persisting weakness or lung fibrosis. Given the limited effectiveness of available agents, new and more potent therapies are clearly needed. However, to facilitate the development of novel therapies, the etiopathogenic mechanisms underlying these conditions require further elucidation. The IIMs are rare diseases, with an annual incidence ranging 2.18 to 7.7 cases per million <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[1]</ref>; so research into these mechanisms has proved difficult.</p><p>It is becoming increasingly obvious that genetic factors are involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[2]</ref>. The previous evidence for a genetic basis in IIMs, as extensively reviewed in 2000 by Shamim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3]</ref>, has largely come from candidate gene studies, as the rarity of IIMs has precluded the use of more robust genetic methods, such as twin studies, whole genome scans, and transmission disequilibrium testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref>. However, multiple case reports where two or more members are affected in one family <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3]</ref>, clearly suggest a familial predisposition for developing IIMs. Indeed, Rider et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref> confirmed that HLA-DRB1*0301 and homozygosity of HLA-DQA1 represent risk factors for developing familial IIMs. Candidate gene studies in nonfamilial IIM have mainly concentrated on the HLA class II region, confirming that HLA-DRB1*0301 and the linked allele HLA-DQA1*0501 are risk factors for developing IIMs in Caucasians, but not in Mesoamerican Mestizos, Koreans, or Japanese populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref>. Gene polymorphisms other than HLA class II are also associ-ated with IIMs, including those of the IL-1 receptor antagonist <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF␣) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>, and Gm/Km allotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HLA-related differences in polymyositis/dermatomyositis</head><p>Most previous IIM candidate gene studies have analyzed adult and juvenile PM/DM patient results together, and some studies even included results from patients with inclusion body myositis (IBM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3]</ref>. Such 'pooling' reflects the sample size problems outlined, and was presumably undertaken to gain power during statistical comparisons of IIM patients with control subjects. Given the phenotypic differences (ie, of clinical, serological, and pathologic features) between IIM subtypes, a more logical approach would be to compare and contrast, rather than group, these diseases. To get over the sample size problems, and thus to address the question of whether PM and DM are genetically the same with respect to HLA class II, we recently coordinated a nationwide collaborative study of 59 physicians, constituting the UK 'Adult Onset Myositis Immunogenetic Collaboration' (AOMIC), which recruited 110 PM and 98 DM UK Caucasian patients over 4 years (Chinoy et al, unpublished data). These patients' HLA-DRB1 data were compared with those of 537 ethnically matched controls. The results confirmed that HLA-DRB1*03 was a risk factor for PM (odds ratio [OR] 4.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6-6.1) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). However, there was also a significant protective effect of HLA-DRB1*07 in PM versus controls (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.4-0.6). The results for DM patients were different, as the association with HLA-DRB1*03 was considerably weaker than for PM (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.1) and, by contrast with PM, DRB1*07 represented a risk factor versus controls (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.9). These results suggest that, at least in a UK Caucasian population, HLA-DRB1 not only plays a role in governing PM/DM disease susceptibility, through association with DRB1*03, but may also govern myositis disease phenotype, through association with DRB1*07. These alleles may be a marker for another contributory factor (eg, a different allele in linkage disequilibrium forming part of a broader haplotype, or an autoantibody).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Autoantibodies and 'elemental disorders'</head><p>It was previously thought that genetically predisposed individuals may only develop their autoimmune disease after certain interactions with environmental triggers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">14]</ref>, so is there any recent evidence to support this? Two previous studies suggested that decreasing latitude exerts an influence on the proportion of a myositis population with DM rather than PM <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15]</ref>. The findings of a more recent paper by Okada et al. <ref type="bibr">[16••]</ref> are thus of great interest. In studying 919 IIM patients in 15 global locations for 13 different climatic variables, surface ultraviolet (UV) light intensity proved the strongest contributor to the relative proportion of DM compared with PM (r = 0.939, P &lt; 4 × 10 7 ), and to the relative proportion of anti-Mi-2 antibodies (r = 0.69, P = 0.02) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). It thus appears that the greater an individual's exposure to sunlight, the greater the likelihood that, if that individual did develop myositis, it would be of anti-Mi-2 positive DM in type. These remarkable results suggest that an environmental factor may be capable of modulating the expression of both the clinical and immunologic features of the resulting myositis. The authors speculated that sunlight achieves this by playing an etiological role in the development of Mi-2 antibodies, and thus DM, via mechanisms of UV-induced immune dysregulation <ref type="bibr">[16••]</ref>. The presence of anti-Mi-2 antibodies in DM patients are very strongly associated with HLA-DRB1*0701, with Mierau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[17]</ref> demonstrating an OR of 22 versus controls, in a Caucasian population, and Shamim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref> demonstrating an association in Caucasians and Mexican Mestizos. Miller describes the concept of 'elemental disorders', where autoimmune diseases as we understand them, are the result of a specific pathogenesis due to interactions between genetic and elemental environmental risk factors to produce unique sign-symptom complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nonclassical HLA and cytokine genes</head><p>TNF␣ is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in immune response regulation, and is encoded within the MHC class III region. The TNF␣ promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position −308, resulting from a G to an A substitution, is termed TNF2 (−308A), and associations with this allele are found in juvenile DM (JDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref> and adult DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>. A recent JDM gene expression profile study led to the proposal of a novel JDM pathogenesis model, which encompasses antiviral, ischemic, and degeneration/regeneration cascades, in which TNF␣ is thought to be a key molecule <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref>. Certainly, in JDM, TNF2 (−308A) is associated with disease chronicity, pathologic calcification <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>, and increased circulating concentrations of an anti- Muscle fibers in biopsies from IIM patients in vivo, and in cultured muscle cells, express intracellular (cytoplasmic) HLA-G, a nonclassical MHC class I molecule, which exhibits a highly restricted tissue distribution under physiologic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23]</ref>. HLA-G is undetectable in normal muscle, but is found in muscle fibers, inflammatory cells, and capillaries in PM, DM, and IBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref>. Through alternative splicing of transcripted HLA-G mRNA, at least seven different isoforms have been identified, labeled HLA-G1 to -G7. HLA-G binds CD8 + cells and antigenic peptides, is thought to play an important role in immunotolerance, and more specifically, may help prevent maternal lymphocytes from attacking fetal tissue. Using in vitro models of human myoblasts and TE671 muscle rhabdomyosarcoma cells, two isoforms, transmembranous HLA-G1 and soluble HLA-G5, have been investigated recently [25•]. The HLA-G isoforms inhibited the primary alloreactive response to muscle cells, and inhibited alloreactive lysis mediated by CD4 + , CD8 + , and natural killer cells. Priming of cytotoxic T cells was also inhibited, and muscle cells were protected from antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell lysis. HLA-G1 and -G5 are therefore powerful inhibitors of the primary and secondary immune responses, and in the future these results could form the basis for developing a novel muscle cell protective agent for reducing IIM cellmediated injury.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Microchimerism</head><p>Microchimerism refers to the low-level persistence of nonself cells due to bidirectional trafficking of fetal/maternal cells during pregnancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[26]</ref>. Maternal microchimeric cells (ie, nonhost cells) have been found in the peripheral blood and muscle lesions of juvenile IIM patients ( ance and activation of chimeric cells, thereby initiating the disease process and inflammation.</p><p>The finding of loss of tolerance is in contrast to other situations where chimerism may be beneficial, such as pregnancy or organ transplantation. An interesting analogy of microchimerism is that of chronic graft-versushost disease (GVHD), where donor cells infiltrate the skin and mucous membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[35]</ref>. Recently, a large cohort of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation over a 30-year period were retrospectively reviewed [36••]. Of the 1859 patients who developed GVHD, 12 also developed a myositis syndrome (GVHD-PM), resembling idiopathic PM in many clinical and laboratory aspects. Not one of the stem cell transplant patients without GVHD developed myositis. As the host's immune system had been eliminated, the lymphocytic infiltration in the muscle of GVHD-PM patients was assumed to consist of donor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[35]</ref>. The cases of GVHD-PM, and their resemblance to IIM, suggest a common underlying pathogenesis in both conditions, with microchimeric cells in IIM forming the role of donor cells, and bolsters the hypothesis that myositis represents an allo-immune mediated disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inclusion body myositis</head><p>As IBM usually presents with distal, rather than proximal, muscle weakness, and thus mimicking peripheral neuropathy, it is rarely seen by rheumatologists. However, due to presence of inflammation in muscle biopsies, sporadic IBM is considered one of the IIMs and is therefore included in this update. Several HLA and non-HLA loci are already known risk factors for sporadic IBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3]</ref>. HLA class I and II associations have recently been examined in 47 sporadic IBM patients and 29,670 controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[38]</ref>. HLA-A*03 (OR 2.6, 95% CI Sporadic IBM muscle biopsies possess structural abnormalities similar to those in brain tissue plaques from Alzheimer's disease patients, including amyloid-␤ precursor protein (A␤PP), amyloid-␤ (A␤), and apolipoprotein E (apoE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[39]</ref>. Using an adenovirus vector, A␤ gene transfer into normal cultured human muscle fibers induced phenotypic abnormalities similar to those found in IBM, suggesting the likelihood of a key role of A␤PP/A␤ in IBM pathogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[40]</ref>. The same gene was transferred into muscle fibers from a patient with known sporadic IBM and associated cardiac amyloidosis in whom a Val122Ile transthyretin (TTR) mutation was also expressed [41•]. The resulting overexpression of the A␤ gene amplified the abnormalities found in this patient's cultured muscle fibers, including accelerated degeneration, inclusions, and vacuole formation, which were over and above those seen in the normal muscle. The TTR mutation could either be a genetic risk factor, or perpetuate the existing IBM. Polymorphisms of two further intracellular amyloid deposits, ApoE and ␣(1)-antichymotrypsin, have been tested in the peripheral blood of 35 sporadic IBM patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[42]</ref>, but no significant associations or correlations with age of onset were found. An important gene expression profiling study has also found increased expression of amyloid-␤ and ApoE in IBM, but significantly elevated levels of the same genes were also demonstrated in PM and DM, suggesting that accumu- lation of such proteins in IBM may be due to posttranscriptional events <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[43]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T cell receptors</head><p>Immunohistochemistry studies of biopsies from patients with PM have demonstrated a predominance of CD8 + T lymphocytes invading non-necrotic muscle fibers that express HLA class I on their cell surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[44]</ref>. Previous studies have demonstrated clonally expanded T cell receptor (TCR) families in muscle fibers of patients with PM. To characterize the role of these T cells further, a process of CDR3 spectratyping was combined with laser microdissection and single-cell polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to select individual pathogenically relevant T cells from PM muscle biopsies <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[45]</ref>. After examining repeat biopsies in one patient, it was shown that T cell clones could persist for many years. In another patient, several T cells had minor nucleotide changes in the CDR3 region of the T cell receptor, which did not alter the amino acid sequences, thus suggesting the presence of different T cell clones driving a common antigendriven response. Oligoclonal CDR3 spectratype peaks disappeared during immunosuppressive treatment. Recent TCR expression work has also been performed in IBM, again suggesting only a limited number of antigens drive the inflammatory reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[46]</ref>. These pathogenically relevant T cells may represent future epitopes for targeted immunotherapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Animal models</head><p>Myositis is thought to be predominantly Th1 driven, initiated by an (unknown) antigen and MHC interaction, leading to T cell expansion, maturation, and subsequent cytokine proliferation (eg, IFN-␥, IL-1, IL-18). Theoretically, dampening down of the Th1 cell response, and switching to a Th2-driven system, producing alternative cytokines (eg, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10), could dampen down the pathogenicity of autoreactive T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[47]</ref>. A strain of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice has been developed, rendered Th1-deficient by a CD2 promoter driven IFN-␥ receptor ␤-chain transgene <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[47]</ref>. An unexpected consequence was the development of an early lethal myopathy due to a CD8 + T cell-dependent myositis syndrome, characterized by a massive leukocyte inflammatory response in the muscle fibers. By interacting with other genetic components in the NOD model, the inhibition of Th1 responses may conversely have exacerbated certain autoimmune responses.</p><p>Another way of influencing the inflammatory response in muscle is through nitric oxide (NO), which can be pro-or anti-inflammatory depending on its concentration and locality. A further transgenic mouse model has been developed with muscle-specific overexpression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), driven by a human skeletal muscle actin promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[48]</ref>. Using a rodent hindlimb unloading/reloading model, overexpression of nNOS in-hibited neutrophil production, and prevented any increases in muscle membrane damage. Muscle-derived NO evidently functions as an anti-inflammatory molecule, and may provide a future potential therapeutic target.</p></div>

The results of these larger studies illustrate the importance during genetic testing of treating IIM subtypes as discrete, rather than grouped, diagnoses. Due to the rarity of IIMs, only further collaboration is likely to elucidate the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Recently doubt has been cast on the diagnostic category PM, as some patients have been shown to have IBM or muscular dystrophy[49]. mRNA microarray gene expression profiling studies may assist in a more robust molecular reclassification of the IIMs<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[43]</ref>, whilst also providing novel molecular insights into the role of genes in IIM subtypes (reviewed in [50•]). It is relatively easy to obtain muscle biopsies, allowing ready analysis of target tissue in IIM patients. Measurements of mRNA levels allow the demonstration of which genes are upregulated or downregulated (albeit without establishing cause and effect), and clarification of which genes to analyze in further candidate gene studies. A recent landmark study examined the molecular profiles of patients with IIMs, showing distinct changes from normal muscle and differing between the IIMs</figDesc><table /></figure>
