<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Myostatin, also called growth and differentiation factor-8, is a member of the transforming growth factor-b superfamily <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Myostatin is a secreted protein considered a negative regulator of muscle growth during development and of muscle mass during adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In mouse models, knocking out the myostatin gene, overexpressing proteins neutralizing myostatin, or natural mutations of the myostatin gene cause increased muscle mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In cattle, naturally occurring myostatin gene mutations leading to inactive protein cause 'double-muscle cattle' <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Recently reported was a child in whom a homozygous myostatin gene mutation that results in reduced production of myostatin protein, was associated with increased muscle bulk and strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Conversely, mature myostatin protein has been reported increased in muscle tissue of patients with HIV-associated muscle wasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and increased myostatin-precursor protein (MstnPP) mRNA reported in muscle wasting associated with osteoarthritis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Within muscle fibres, myostatin is synthesized as a MstnPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. MstnPP and its mRNA, and mature myostatin, are predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle tissue (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). MstnPP, a 375-amino-acid protein translated from a 3.1 kb mRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, consists of three structural domains: a signal sequence; an N-terminal 28 kDa propeptide, also referred to as latency associated peptide <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>; and a C-terminal 12 kDa mature myostatin peptide <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Intracellular processing of myostatin from MstnPP has been proposed to occur through furin <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>We recently showed in biopsied sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) muscle fibres that both MstnPP and myostatin dimer were significantly increased, and MstnPP was physically associated with amyloid-b precursor protein (AbPP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Moreover, by light-and electron-microscopic immunocytochemistry, MstnPP/myostatin colocalized with amyloid-b (Ab)/AbPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. s-IBM is severely progressive, the most common muscle disease of older persons, and there is no successful treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Histological hallmarks of s-IBM include: (1) vacuolar degeneration and atrophy of muscle fibres, accompanied by intramuscle-fibre accumulations of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, including Ab/AbPP; (2) muscle-fibre atrophy; and (3) mononuclear lymphocytic inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Recently demonstrated in s-IBM muscle fibres were inhibition of 26S proteasome activity and presence of aggresomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Accumulation of AbPP/Ab appears to be an early upstream step in the s-IBM pathogenesis, because: (i) abnormal accumulation of AbPP epitopes appears to precede other abnormalities in IBM muscle fibres <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>; and (ii) several aspects of the s-IBM phenotype, including Ab accumulation, proteasome inhibition and aggresome formation, were produced in cultured normal human muscle fibres (CHMFs) after long-term overexpression of AbPP in them <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The latter provides a useful IBM human-muscle tissue-culture model. The aim of the present study was to utilize this model to investigate possible mechanisms responsible for increased MstnPP and myostatin within the biopsied s-IBM muscle fibres. We cultured human muscle fibres from satellite cells obtained from six normal diagnostic muscle biopsies, as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and referenced therein. Into well-differentiated 3-week-old cultured muscle fibres we transferred a 3 kb human AbPP-cDNA encoding 751-AbPP using a replication-deficient adenovirus vector at 0.3 ¥ 10 8 pfu/ml culture medium, as detailed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. In addition, we treated some of the cultures with 1 mm epoxomicin (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, an irreversible proteasome inhibitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Four days after AbPP gene transfer and 24 h after epoxomicin treatment, control and AbPP-overexpressing CHMFs (AbPP+ CHMFs) were processed for light-and electron-microscopic immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. For all the myostatin studies, we used an anti-myostatin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA), which was shown to be highly specific in our studies and in studies by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. On immunoblots, this antibody recognizes both a 55 kDa band of MstnPP and a 26 kDa band of mature myostatin dimer, and by immunocytochemistry it recognizes both MstnPP/myostatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. For AbPP/Ab studies, we used a well-characterized mouse monoclonal 6E10 antibody (Signet, Dedham, MA, USA), diluted 1:100, which morphologically recognizes Ab/AbPP in both s-IBM muscle fibres and Alzheimer's disease brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, and by immunoblots recognizes both AbPP and Ab <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</p><p>• Single-and double-labelled immunofluorescence was performed as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, using anti-myostatin antibody diluted 1:100 and 6E10 diluted 1:150. Mouse monoclonal antibody against g-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), diluted 1:50, was used to identify aggresomes. • Double-labelled gold-immuno-electronmicroscopy was performed on nonproteasome-inhibited AbPP+ CHMFs as previously detailed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, using the same antibodies discussed above. • For immunoblotting, cultured muscle fibres were harvested in RIPA buffer, homogenized, and protein concentration measured using the Bradford method <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Denatured 40 mg protein samples were loaded onto 10% NuPage gels, electrophoresed in MOPS-SDS buffer, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoprobed overnight with anti-myostatin antibody diluted 1:500. After incubation with appropriate secondary antibody, blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system. Protein loading was evaluated by actin bands visualized with a mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Quantification of immunoreactivity was performed by densitometric analysis using the Kodak-GelLogic-440 system (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY, USA). • We performed a combined immunoprecipitationimmunoblotting, as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, to evaluate whether MstnPP physically associates with AbPP/Ab. In brief, 100 mg of homogenized protein from AbPP+ CHMFs was immunoprecipitated with either 5 mg of 6E10 antibody or anti-myostatin antibody. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 20 ml of protein-G-Sepharose-4 fast flow (Amersham-Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ, USA), washed, denatured, separated by electrophoresis, transferred to membranes, and immunoprobed with either anti-myostatin or 6E10 antibody, and then with appropriate secondary antibody, and developed. • For RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated and processed as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. One microgram of RNA was used in the RT-PCR reaction utilizing the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), with either primers (i) for MstnPP (Fw-GTGGTACCTCATGCAAAAACTGCAACT CTGT; Rv-ATGGATCCAATCTCATGAGCACCCACAGC), or (ii) for GAPDH <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and stained with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The conditions of the reactions were experimentally checked to ensure that signals were in the linear range of the PCR. Our immunofluorescence results revealed very weak cytoplasmic staining of MstnPP/myostatin within control CHMFs, and much stronger, mainly diffuse, cytoplasmic staining in AbPP+ CHMFs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,B</ref>). In 70-80% of the epoxomicin-treated AbPP+ CHMFs, strong MstnPP/ myostatin immunoreactivity was present in the form of aggregates, which also contained Ab/AbPP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C,D</ref>). Their immuno-colocalization with g-tubulin indicated that MstnPP/myostatin immunoreactive aggregates were aggresomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E,F</ref>). By gold-immuno- electronmicroscopy, within AbPP+ CHMFs, both MstnPP/ myostatin and Ab/AbPP were associated together with 6-10 nm fibrils (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) and with amorphous and floccular material (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B,C</ref>). We have previously proposed that 6-10 nm fibrils reflect a b-pleated-sheet amyloid, while amorphous and floccular material may represent preamyloid <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> Additionally, both Ab/AbPP and MstnPP/ myostatin were immunolocalized perinuclearly (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>). Immunoblots demonstrated that in our AbPP+ CHMFs a 55 kDa MstnPP was increased 2.3fold (P &lt; 0.01) as compared with control cultures (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A,B</ref>), but according to our semiquantative RT-PCR study there was no significant difference in the amount of MstnPP mRNA between control and AbPP+ CHMFs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C,D</ref>). Mature myostatin was not apparent on our immunoblots, which is consistent with a recent study demonstrating that in well-differentiated myotubes of C2C12 mouse cell-line, as well as in bovine myotubes, mature myostatin was not detected on immunoblots <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Proteasome inhibition did not appear to influence the amount of MstnPP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A,B</ref>), but MstnPP mRNA was decreased 2.5-fold (P &lt; 0.01) as compared with controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C,D</ref>).</p><p>The combined immunoprecipitation-immunoblot procedure showed that, in our IBM culture model, MstnPP and AbPP coimmunoprecipitate (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>,F ), similarly to s-IBM muscle biopsies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The present study provides a novel demonstration in cultured human muscle that overexpression of AbPP/Ab increases accumulation of MstnPP. Accordingly, this mechanism might be, at least partially, responsible for the increase of MstnPP and of mature myostatin in the biopsied s-IBM muscle fibres <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Whether lack of detectable mature myostatin dimer in our model (i) reflects its secretion to the culture medium, or (ii) is related to the sensitivity of our antibody remains to be studied.</p><p>The mechanism(s) by which AbPP/Ab increases MstnPP is presently not known. One possibility is that AbPP binding to MstnPP causes its posttranslational modification that lessens its degradation and traffic, resulting in its accumulation. This possibility would accord with the fact that in proteasome-inhibited CHMFs there is no decrease in the total amount of MstnPP despite its significantly decreased mRNA.</p><p>It is currently not definitely known whether the ubiquitin-proteasome system participates in MstnPP degradation, but in our proteasome-inhibited CHMFs, MstnPP was accumulated in aggresomes, which probably impairs its traffic and degradation.</p><p>Even though in our study AbPP/Ab overexpression does not appear to influence MstnPP mRNA, a possible enhancement of MstnPP transcription might be masked by a proteasome inhibition produced by AbPP overexpression <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and, as we have discussed above, MstnPP mRNA is decreased by proteasome inhibition. Collectively, the data in our current study support the proposal that in s-IBM muscle fibres, abnormalities of AbPP/Ab precede increased MstnPP/myostatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. As excessive myostatin may contribute to human muscle-fibre atrophy (see above), therapeutically inhibiting MstnPP or myostatin might be beneficial in various neuromuscular disorders associated with atrophy. Our culture system should provide a useful model to study regulatory mechanisms of MstnPP production and its processing in human muscle. And this culture model might be useful in developing new treatment strategies to mitigate myostatin and its effects. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
