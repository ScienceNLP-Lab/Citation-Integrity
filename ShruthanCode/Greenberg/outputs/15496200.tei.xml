<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract: Previous studies of sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) have shown a strong association with HLA-DR3 and other components of the 8.1 ancestral haplotype (AH) (HLA-A1, B8, DR3), where the susceptibility locus has been mapped to the central major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region between HLA-DR and C4. Here, the association with HLA-DR3 and other genes in the central MHC and class II region was further investigated in a group of 42 sIBM patients and in an ethnically similar control group (n ¼ 214), using single-nucleotide polymorphisms and microsatellite screening. HLA-DR3 (marking DRB1*0301 in Caucasians) was associated with sIBM (Fisher's test). However, among HLA-DR3-positive patients and controls, carriage of HLA-DR3 without microsatellite and single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles of the 8.1AH (HLA-A1, B8, DRB3*0101, DRB1*0301, DQB1*0201) was marginally less common in patients. Patients showed no increase in carriage of the 18.2AH (HLA-A30, B18, DRB3*0202, DRB1*0301, DQB1*0201) or HLA-DR3 without the central MHC of the 8.1AH, further arguing against HLA-DRB1 as the direct cause of susceptibility. Genes between HLA-DRB1 and HOX12 require further investigation. BTL-II lies in this region and is expressed in muscle. Carriage of allele 2 (exon 6) was more common in patients. BTL-II(E6)*2 is characteristic of the 35.2AH (HLA-A3, B35, DRB1*01) in Caucasians and HLA-DR1, BTL-II(E6)*2, HOX12*2, RAGE*2 was carried by several patients. The 8.1AH and 35.2AH may confer susceptibility to sIBM independently or share a critical allele.</p><p>Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) belongs to a group of acquired muscle diseases known as idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. The other diseases in this group are polymyositis and dermatomyositis. All three diseases cause chronic muscular weakness and are characterized by inflammatory infiltrates within skeletal muscle. sIBM largely affects Caucasians and is more common in males than in females <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. In the mostly Caucasian population of Western Australia, the incidence is 3.5 per 10 5 over the age of 50 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. sIBM is characterized histopathologically by nuclear and cytoplasmic filamentous inclusions and vacuoles rimmed by basophilic granules in Key words: ancestral haplotype; inclusion body myositis; MHC; microsatellite; single-nucleotide polymorphism the muscle fibers. Electron microscopy shows that these rimmed vacuoles correspond to membranous whorls in areas of cytoplasmic degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Hereditary IBM is a distinct condition that lacks the lymphocytic inflammation seen in sIBM and begins 10-30 years earlier. A role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of sIBM is supported by corticosteroid therapy having beneficial effects in some patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Endomysial infiltrates comprise macrophages and T lymphocytes, notably CD8 T cells that invade muscle fibers and induce cytotoxic necrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. However, the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of sIBM remains unclear.</p><p>sIBM occurs with other autoimmune diseases in up to 15% of patients. Associated conditions include systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjo ¨gren's syndrome, dermatomyositis, granulomatous liver disease, and scleroderma <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, supporting an autoimmune etiology for sIBM. This is consistent with observed association between sIBM and HLA alleles. A cohort of 30 patients has previously associated sIBM with carriage of DRB1*0301, DRB1*0101, DQB1*0201, and/or DRB1*0603 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. A similar cohort of Australian patients showed that the clearest association is with a MHC haplotype defined by HLA-A1, B8, DRB3*0101, DRB1*0301, DQB1*0201 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>. This is known as the 8.1 ancestral haplotype (AH) and is highly conserved, being carried by 88% of Western Australians who have the HLA-B8 allele <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</p><p>Identification of the critical MHC gene(s) affecting any disease is hampered by linkage disequilibrium, which is particularly strong in the 8.1AH. However, by comparing recombinant haplotypes generated by historical recombinations between known ancestral haplotypes in patients and an ethnically matched control population, one can begin to localize the gene or genes which have a direct effect on disease. This requires that the haplotypes are characterized by multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellite alleles. Using this approach, we have shown that the effect of class II alleles (DR3, DQ2) on type 1 diabetes is potentiated by a central MHC gene between TNFA and HLA-B <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Here, the roles in sIBM of genes in the central We also considered BTL-II (butyrophilin-like MHC class II-associated gene; also known as BTNL2), which lies at the border of the class II and central MHC regions. It encodes six exons with homology to the butyrophilin gene family. Expression analyses of the BTL-II locus on mouse tissues showed expression in skeletal muscle and gut tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. </p></div>

These analyses showed the high conservation of the central MHC and class II region of the 8.1AH in patients and controls. However, HLA-DR3 without other markers of the central MHC of the 8.1AH was seen marginally less frequently in patient than control samples (Fisher's exact test; P ¼ 0.06). A similar pattern was evident in the class II region (P ¼ 0.004). Whilst the differences were small, the trend is opposite to that seen with markers of the 8.1AH telomeric of (and including) HOX12 or centromeric of (and including) LMP7. These were at least as common in patients as controls. Some samples were also typed for the G1152 microsatellite allele which lies near HLA-DQ. The results conformed with the distribution of alleles of LMP7 (data not shown).</p><p>An alternative approach to the analysis of these results reveals that patients and controls had similar carriage of HLA-DR3 without alleles but differ at all loci telomeric of (and including) DRB3. To define the most probable location of the critical gene, all recombinant haplotypes were represented graphically (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).

Each line represents one patient. Open symbols denote adjacent markers discordant from the 8.1AH. These represent the boundary of the major histocompatibility complex segment likely to contain the critical gene(s). Missing circles at LMP7 indicate samples for which typing was not available. Slippages of one repeat element of a microsatellite are shown as hatched symbols. Price et al : Two MHC haplotypes and inclusion body myositis Tissue Antigens 2004: 64: 575-580 effect was lost rapidly as we traversed the central MHC so the critical gene is likely to be close to DRB1. The 18.2AH and the 8.1AH share HLA-DRB1*0301, DQA1*0501, and DQB1*0201 but differ in carriage of DRB3*0202 (18.2AH) rather than DRB3*0101 (8.1AH) and at all loci telomeric of this gene. DRB3alleles have been associated with susceptibility to Graves' disease in African Americans<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> and Jamaicans<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. These studies compared the class II alleles of the 8.1 and 18.2AH (although this terminology was not used). Central MHC and other class II genes were not addressed and require further consideration, as the haplotypes diverge immediately telomeric of DRB1. This provides a precedent for consideration of DRB3 as a candidate gene. Other candidates (in chromosomal order away from DRB3) are DRA, BTL-II<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, TSBP (testis-specific basic protein), NOTCH4 (a transmembrane receptor which regulates cell fate decisions)<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, and G18 (a predicted gene with no known function)<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.BTL-II lies betweenTSBP and DRA and is expressed in skeletal muscle. Carriage of allele 2 of exon 6 was more common in the patients. As BTL-II(E6)*2 is characteristic of the 35.2AH (HLA-A3, B35, DR1) in Caucasians, carriage of other haplotypic markers was investigated. A region of the 35.2AH defined by HLA-DR1, BTL-I(E6)*2, HOX12*T, RAGE*T was more common among patients than controls. As several patients carried these alleles without any component of the 8.1AH, the two haplotypes may confer susceptibility to sIBM independently or may share a critical allele. Studies of further sIBM patients, including the rare cases from other ethnic groups, may help identify MHC genes responsible for susceptibility to sIBM.</figDesc><table /></figure>
