<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose. Aging and oxidative stress resulting from overexpression of Alzheimer precursor protein (βAPP) have been studied as important factors contributing to the major agerelated (sporadic), and minor (hereditary) forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and muscle inclusion body myositis, (IBM). AD and prion proteins accumulate in plaques linked with AD and scrapie diseases, and in rimmed vacuoles of IBM. Soluble β-amyloid (Aβ) fibrillar forms are now thought to play a critical role in and outside of cells by producing oxidative stress. In lens, βAPP and Aβ increase in cultured lenses exposed to oxidative stress, and in areas of lens fiber cell degeneration in thiamine (vitamin B1) deprived mice, a classic model of systemic oxidative stress. The purpose of the present study is to extend our studies of amyloid disease-related protein expression in mammalian lenses.</p><p>Methods. Western blot, immunohistochemical detection, and RT-PCR methods were used to identify and quantitate prion protein expression in human, monkey, and guinea pig lenses.</p><p>Results. We demonstrate for the first time that prion protein gene expression increases with oxidative stress in cultured human lens epithelial cells. In addition, we detected greater prion protein gene expression in fiber cells than epithelial cells in vivo. This is consistent with increases in prion protein expression demonstrated in myoblasts and neuronal cells induced to differentiate. Our initial investigations of prion protein in human lens cataracts identified increased prion protein immunoreactivity in regions of lens fiber cell degeneration.</p><p>Conclusions. The present data indicate that prion protein expression increases during lens development, and is sub-stantially increased in cultured human lens epithelial cells exposed to oxidative stress. We also provide evidence that prion protein immunoreactivity can be increased in regions of fiber cell disorganization. These data suggest a potential role for prion protein as a marker for some types of lens pathology, and in the mechanism of oxidative stress-related lens degeneration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RNA isolation</head><p>Total RNA was isolated from whole lenses taken from euthanized animals as described elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> In some cases the epithelial cell layer was separated from the fiber cell mass before RNA extraction. Human lenses came from the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA). For immunohistochemical examination, lenses were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in pH 7.4 Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for eight hrs, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Cell culture experiments For cell culture experiments, human lens epithelial cells: SRA 01-04 (gift of V. Reddy, Univ. Michigan) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) (Gibco/ BRL Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) and supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Gibco/BRL) and 0.05mg/ml gentamycin (Gibco/BRL) in a 5% CO 2 , 37 o C incubator. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> The cells were grown until they reached 95% confluency, and were then washed with DMEM without supplements. The cell cultures were then placed in DMEM with 200µM hydrogen peroxide final concentration or an equivalent volume of water added and incubated under 5% CO 2 for three hours. The cells were then washed twice with PBS (Gibco/BRL) and harvested by lysis with RNA extraction solution (guanidinium isothiocyanate) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The number of attached viable cells did not change during the three hour incubation as determined by trypan blue exclusion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> The RNA was purified using an RNA isolation kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), followed by DNase treatment, and the integrity of the RNA was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reverse transcriptase dependent PCR (RT-PCR)</head><p>To determine the relative levels of expression of prion protein mRNA in treated and untreated cultured epithelial cells or lens tissue samples, we performed RT-PCR reactions using 300 ng of total RNA per reaction as described elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> The One Step RT-PCR system and protocol (Gibco/ BRL) was used to generate cDNAs and to amplify the prion protein cDNA products. The primer set used in experiments shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> corresponds to a region of bovine prion protein exon one and a region of exon two common to many mammalian species: (sense: 5' CCTCCAGTCGCTG-CCAGTCGCTGACAGCCGC 3'), (anti-sense: 5' CATG-GCACTTCCCAGCATGTAGCCGCCAAGGCC 3'). Primers used in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> were from human prion protein se- quence (sense: 5'-CAGCCTCATGGTGGTGGCTGG-3'), (anti-sense: 5' TAGTAACGGTCCTCATAGTCA 3'). Oligonucleotide primers for detection of human prion protein mRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) contained the following human prion protein sequences (sense: 5' GGCTGCTGGATGCTGGTTCTC 3'), (anti-sense: 5' ACCGTGTGCTGCTTGATTGTG 3'). In addition, RT-PCR was also carried out with a set of GAPDH-specific gene primers (see ref. 26 for primer sequences) for amplification of the GAPDH transcript as an internal standard. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> PCR products were examined using agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA molecular weight standards (100bp ladder, Gibco/BRL) to determine the approximate molecular weights of amplified products. Finally, PCR products were subjected to nucleotide sequence determination and BLAST search (National Center for Biotechnology Transfer, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) to confirm the identity of amplified products. Multiple primers that assayed different portions of the prion protein transcripts served as controls, and the cDNA products identified by nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed molecular weight estimations from agarose gels. Determination of relative transcript levels was made using a flatbed PC-computer assisted scanner and 'NIHimage' software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunological detection of prion protein</head><p>Western blot analyses of total proteins from clear human lenses were carried out using standard methods. A purified IgG mononclonal antibody preparation (clone 3F4) (Senetek, St. Louis MO) was used together with a horseradish peroxidase indirect immunochemical detection kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) to visualize immune complexes. For analysis of prion protein expression in clear and cataractous lenses, histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, or alternatively were processed for immunohistochemical detection of prion protein. Sections were probed with the 3F4 primary antibody (1:2000) and subsequently probed with biotinylated goat anti-mouse antisera (1:2000) (Vector Labs) followed by fluorescein linked avidin (Vector Labs) for examination using fluorescence microscopy. A monoclonal antibody that recognizes SV-40 T antigen (1:2000) (Oncogene) was used as a control. Anti-MIP26 polyclonal antibody (1:2000) served as a positive control that produces a contrasting staining pattern. This antibody preparation was used with red fluorescent-tagged avidin for double-staining experiments. This permitted us to photograph brightfield, fluorescein, and rhodamine fluorescent views of the same field of lens fiber cells. Secondary antibodies and fluorescent tagged avidin preparations were used according to the specifications of the manufacturer (Vector Labs). Standard Zeiss brand fluorescein and rhodamine fluorescence microscopy filter cubes were used.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prion protein is expressed in mammalian lenses</head><p>We detected prion protein mRNA in samples purified from guinea pig and rhesus monkey lenses using reverse transcriptase dependent PCR (RT-PCR). The amplified cDNAs shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> demonstrate that cDNAs of expected molecular weights (550bp) were produced from both guinea pig and monkey lens RNAs. The oligonucleotide amplification primers used in these experiments are derived from an upstream non-coding exon in the bovine prion protein sequence, and from a downstream protein-coding region present in all mammalian species listed in the Genbank database.

Translation of the guinea pig cDNA produced an amino acid sequence with high identity to the human prion protein. In addition, the GAPDH cDNAs amplified from guinea pig lens RNA were also sequenced and contained the expected nucleotides. The partial nucleotide sequence for guinea pig prion protein has been entered into the Genbank database (accession no. AF139166).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prion protein gene expression increases in lens fiber cells</head><p>The relative levels of prion protein mRNA were assayed using RT-PCR and RNAs purified from epithelial and fiber cells of clear adult guinea pig lenses. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows that the in vivo expression of prion protein mRNA is relatively greater in lens fiber cells compared to lens epithelial cells. The amplified cDNAs migrated with the expected molecular weight (MW) and upon nucleotide sequence determination were found to contain the expected sequences consistent with the estimated MW. As in the experiments described above, we amplified GAPDH mRNA as an internal standard for expression levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> The GAPDH levels were normalized in the epithelial and fiber cell samples. A comparison of levels of amplified prion protein cDNA in relation to GAPDH indicated that prion protein gene expression is approximately 8-10 fold greater in the fiber cells compared to epithelial cells in the guinea pig lens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prion protein expression increases in human lens epithelial cells exposed to oxidative stress</head><p>To determine the effect of oxidative stress, a known cataractogenic agent, on prion protein mRNA levels, a human lens epithelial cell line was exposed to 200 µM hydrogen peroxide for three hours (see Materials and Methods). The viability of treated and control cells as determined by trypan blue exclusion did not differ. However, RT-PCR analysis of prion protein transcripts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) revealed an approximately 8-10fold increase in the stressed cells versus the non-stressed cells normalized to the levels of GAPDH expression in the same samples. This is the first time to our knowledge that the induction of prion protein gene expression by oxidative stress has been demonstrated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detection of prion protein in human lenses</head><p>We examined samples of homogenized lens protein from clear human lenses by western blot. The results shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> demonstrate that a cross-reacting protein of approximately 28-30 kDa is detected in human lenses with the well-characterized monoclonal antibody, clone 3F4 (Senetek). The apparent molecular weight of this protein agrees with that expected for human prion protein. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunolocalization of prion protein in human lens</head><p>Human lens sections from four lenses with cortical cataracts were examined for the presence of prion protein by immunohistochemistry using the 3F4 monoclonal antibody. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Western blot detection of prion protein in human lens extract of 100 µg of total human lens protein was applied to the left lane and probed with 3F4 monoclonal antibody (Senetek). Prestained molecular weight markers were applied to the right lane.</p><p>Although prion protein in lens samples was readily detected on western blots, the immunofluorescence methodology used in this study detected little or no accumulations of prion protein in clear lenses or normal regions of these lenses with cortical cataracts. Lens regions where fiber cell degeneration is present are shown in the brightfield micrographs in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> (Panel I, A and B). A higher magnification brightfield view of disorganized fiber cells is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> (Panel I, C and E.)

Section A shows a brightfield photomicrograph of the posterior region of this lens. Section B shows immunofluorescent detection of prion protein visualized with a green fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody with staining observed only in regions of disorganization of the normal lens fiber cell pattern. Section C shows the same field probed with antibodies raised against MIP26 protein. MIP26 immune complexes were visualized using a red-fluorescenttagged secondary antibody and also photographed in black and white. In addition, no SV40 large T antigen was de-tected in any of the human lens sections analyzed in a similar manner. The staining pattern obtained using anti-MIP26 antibodies is significantly different from prion protein immunostaining. As seen in section C of Panel II, MIP26 staining is predominantly associated with the fiber cell membrane pattern seen in the brightfield photograph. The arrowheads in sections B and C of Panel II designate a fiber cell with differential prion protein and MIP26 staining.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study provides evidence that prion protein and its mRNA are expressed in human and animal lenses. Relative to the expression of the housekeeping gene GAPDH, prion protein transcripts were found to be significantly greater in fiber cells than epithelial cells in vivo. This finding agrees with experiments demonstrating increases in prion protein expression during the in vitro terminal differentiation of muscle cell myoblasts and neuronal cells into elongated cell types. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> We also demonstrate that prion protein expression increases in cultured lens epithelial cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide, a well-established cataractogenic agent.

The present study adds prion protein to this list. It has been well established that lens opacification, the medical condition of cataract, has been associated with oxidative stress. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> Together these studies linking AD and prion proteins with cataract formation further support our hypothesis that Alzheimer pathophysiology contributes to the mechanism of lens degeneration linked with oxidative stress. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> In addition, we demonstrate that prion protein expression increases significantly in cultured human lens epithelial cells exposed to oxidative stress. Since the normal lens is exposed to chronic oxidative stress, the increase in prion protein expression is consistent with data demonstrating that prion protein acts to protect muscle and brain cells against oxidative stress by modulating Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn SOD) activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> For example, expression of higher levels of prion protein in these cell types increases their resistance to oxidative stress. In summary, our data raises the possibility that prion protein may be a useful marker for lens histopathology, and suggests that further studies of a potential role for prion protein as a contributor to lens pathology are warranted.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
