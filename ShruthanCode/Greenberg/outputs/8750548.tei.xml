<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a rare inflammatory myopathy of unknown aetiology. Most cases occur sporadically, but a few familial cases have been reported. Clinical features of IBM include slowly progressive, often asymmetrical, weakness of proximal and distal muscles, and dysphagia in about 40% of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Sporadic IBM begins in the sixth or seventh decade of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> with an earlier onset in familial cases. Previous reports of familial IBM have suggested an autosomal dominant pattern restricted to males <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, autosomal recessive inheritance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> or simple autosomal dominant inheritance with no sex restriction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Light microscopy reveals a variable degree of rimmed vacuoles and inflammatory infiltrates; electron microscopy demonstrates typical cytoplasmic and/or nuclear inclusions in muscle fibres, consisting of 15-18 nm filaments <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In some cases separation from non-inflammatory myopathies with rimmed vacuoles can be difficult. Despite identical histological findings in sporadic and hereditary IBM, some familial cases display atypical clinical features including sparing of the quadriceps muscles <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> or abnormalities of the white matter of the brain on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or on cranial computed axial tomography (CT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. We report the cases of two sisters who responded well to methylprednisolone and azathioprine treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material and methods</head><p>The biopsied muscle specimens were processed according to routine techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Sections (6 mm) were stained with modified trichrome stain, haematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and oil red. Enzyme histochemical preparations included acid phosphatase, NADH tetrazolium reductase, alkaline, and acid AT-Pase. Immunohistochemical preparations used antibodies against ubiquitin (DAKO dilution 1:100) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and b-A4 amyloid (Boehringer Mannheim, dilution 1:10). Hypertrophy and atrophy factors and variability coefficients were measured and calculated according to Dubowitz and Brooke <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> with a Hewlett Packard computerized program.</p><p>The clinical examination of both patients before and after treatment was carried out by M.N. and H.R.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case reports</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case 1</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical presentation</head><p>A 60-year-old woman developed asymmetrical, proximal and distal muscle weakness predominantly affecting the lower limbs when aged 55 years. The onset was gradual, and progression was slow, leading to dysphagia 3 years after the first symptoms had started. No other family members except her sister (case 2) suffered from a muscle disorder.</p><p>Clinical examination showed moderate atrophy of proximal and distal limb muscles. In the upper extremities, weakness of the deltoid and triceps muscles was moderate, while the biceps muscles and hand and finger extensors were more severely affected. Finger and hand flexors showed only mild weakness. In the lower extremities, the quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles displayed a marked and nearly symmetrical paresis. Severe atrophy and weakness were seen in the left tibialis anterior muscle with only moderate involvement of the right side (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Neck muscles were moderately affected. Dysphagia was characterized by difficulty in swallowing solid foods and occasional choking or nasal regurgitation. No weight loss was reported. Sensation was normal. Deep tendon reflexes were absent in the lower and weak in the upper limbs. Electromyography (EMG) performed on deltoid, quadriceps and anterior tibial muscles revealed spontaneous activity at rest with fibrillations and myopathic motor unit potentials. Occasionally, repetitive high frequency motor unit discharges were seen. Nerve conduction studies were normal. Serum creatine kinase (CK) was markedly increased (530 U/l; normal up to 80 U/l). Cranial CT did not reveal any abnormality.</p><p>Muscle MRI of both legs was performed with a 1.5 T Gyroscan S 15 (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Tl-weighted scans revealed atrophy and fatty degeneration of both sartorius and quadriceps muscles predominantly affecting the vastus lateralis muscle. The left tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles were also affected. T2-weighted MRI showed an increased signal intensity within both quadriceps muscles and within nearly all muscles of the left lower leg compatible with inflammation and oedema. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Morphology</head><p>Light microscopy. Open muscle biopsy was performed on the quadriceps muscle. Frozen sections (6 p.m thick) were stained using standard procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In cross-sections, muscle fibres revealed an increased range of fibre diameters with hypertrophic and atrophic fibres, including some small angular fibres (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). There was no atrophy of type 1 fibres, whereas the atrophy factor of type 2 fibres was 71. The hypertrophy factor for type 1 fibres was 39, and 71 for type 2 fibres. The ratio of type 1 fibres to type 2 fibres was 48 to 53. In the NADH preparation, several scattered muscle fibres showed an irregular staining pattern. There was an increase in internal nuclei (25%). Numerous autophagic ("rimmed") vacuoles and occasional split fibres were present (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Some fibres contained finely dispersed lipid droplets. Scattered muscle fibres were necrotic with phagocytosis; others were regenerating. An occasional cytoplasmic body was encountered within a muscle fibre that also harboured an autophagic vacuole (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Endomysial fibrosis was minimal. There were a few small inflammatory infiltrates (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a, b</ref>) within muscle fascicles and around perimysial small vessels. Acid phosphatase activity was present within several interstitial cells and in macrophages inside muscle fibres. Vessel walls appeared regular in structure.</p><p>Electron microscopy. While the majority of sarcomeres appeared intact, several muscle fibres contained areas of minicores, frequently scattered across a longitudinally cut muscle fibre with loss of mitochondria and excessive streaming of Z-bands. Nuclei appeared rather large and a few were located in the subsarcolemmal area. Often, the sarcoplasm was rather electron-lucent with only a small electron-dense rim at the periphery. Distinct nucleoli were frequent. Nuclei were round, oval or lobulated. One nucleus contained a large aggregate of randomly arranged filaments of some 20 nm in diameter (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Numerous muscle fibres contained subsarcolemmal regions devoid of sarcomeres, but filled with finely granular material, often aggregates of cytoplasmic glycogen, mitochondria, and dense bodies. Autophagic vacuoles contained myelin-like material and other debris (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). Only rarely were collections of cytoplasmic filaments randomly deposited at the margin of autophagic vacuoles (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a, b</ref>). The nucleus containing an aggregate of intranuclear filaments was located within a muscle fibre which otherwise appeared normal, but nuclei close to autophagic vacuoles and aggregates of cytoplasmic filaments did not contain filaments. Occasionally, there were empty loops of basal lamina.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment</head><p>Immunosuppressive treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (beginning with 500 mg methylprednisolone/day for 5 days) and azathioprine (150 mg/day) was started after muscle biopsy. Dysphagia subsided completely within 3 months.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical presentation</head><p>The 58-year-old sister of case 1 developed slowly progressive proximal and distal muscle atrophy and weakness in all four limbs at the age of 48 years. The pattern of affected muscles was similar to that of her sister. In contrast, the calf muscles were only moderately affected (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Dysphagia followed several years later and consisted of difficulty in swallowing solid and later also liquid foods. Weight loss of 5 kg within 12 months was reported. Deep tendon reflexes of the lower limbs were diminished. Sensation was normal. Serum CK was elevated (380 U/l). An EMG of the biceps and quadriceps muscles revealed a myopathic pattern and spontaneous activity. The findings of nerve conduction studies were normal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> Case 2. CD8-positive lymphocytic infiltrates, x 640</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Morphology</head><p>Light microscopy. Open muscle biopsy was performed on the left lateral vastus muscle. On cross-sections, variation in muscle fibre diameters was markedly increased. Variability coefficients were 404 and 388 for type 1 and type 2 fibres, respectively, corroborating the pathological increase in fibre diameter variation. Occasional small elongated and angulated fibres were present. The atrophy/hypertrophy factors were 280/120 for type 1 and 200/360 for type 2 fibres, respectively. Five per cent of all fibres showed internal nuclei. Typical autophagic vacuoles in muscle fibres were rare. Very rarely, single necrotic muscle fibres could be seen. Endomysial and perivascular inflammatory cells were frequent (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) and consisted of a mixed CD4/CD8 T-lymphocyte population and of macrophages. In single fibres undergoing necrosis, there was an increase of acid phosphatase activity. Histochemical fibre typing showed about 35% type 1 and 65% type 2 fibres, respectively, distributed in a typical checkerboard pattern. There was no neurogenic type grouping. Immunohistochemistry with a ubiquitin antibody gave positive reactions in muscle fibres with vacuoles undergoing degeneration. No immunoreactivity could be found with a polyclonal antibody against b-A4 amyloid.</p><p>Electron microscopy. Ultrastructural changes were less prominent when compared with those seen in the muscle of her sister. Autophagic vacuoles were located as described above. Intranuclear aggregates of filaments were frequent and identical to the ones described in case 1. Streaming of Z-bands was mild and occasionally seen. The mitochondrial population appeared normal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment</head><p>Despite the fact that her sister had obvious benefit from immunosuppressive treatment, the patient refused drug therapy for many years. Only recently was immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone (beginning with 100 mg daily) and azathioprine (100 mg daily) started. After 6 months of treatment, muscle strength of the deltoid, biceps and triceps muscles improved slightly, but nearly no change of muscle force was observed in leg muscles. Dysphagia nearly disappeared. Occasional choking was reported. The CK level fell to normal values (51 U/I).</p><p>The clinical presentation of the two sisters differs in some details from other previously reported familial cases of IBM, underscoring the heterogeneity of this muscle disease. Whereas in our patients both proximal and distal muscle groups were affected, a relative sparing of the quadriceps muscle was described by Massa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and Sadeh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> as a characteristic sign in families of Iranian Jews. The same observation has been made by Hentati et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> in a Tunisian kindred who additionally showed alterations of the cerebral white matter. A new syndrome consisting of familial m y o p a t h y with changes resembling I B M and periventricular leucoencephalopathy has also been described by Cole et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. There was no evidence of leucoencephalopathy on cranial CT in case 1.</p><p>Whereas in most familial cases of IBM the initial symptoms of the m y o p a t h y occur between the second and fourth decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, onset of weakness in our patients was later. The morphological findings in both cases conform to the m y o p a t h o l o g y of IBM. In a large series of patients with sporadic IBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[ 18]</ref>, a triad of grouped atrophic fibres, inflammatory infiltrates and r i m m e d vacuoles was encountered in 88% of the patients; typical filaments could be demonstrated in 93% by electron microscopy. Some patients were considered to have I B M even in the absence of inflammatory infiltrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. In most cases sporadic I B M can be differentiated from familial forms of I B M by the usual lack of inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, paucity of fibres containing phosphorylated tau protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and paucity of Congo-red fibres in the latter <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In view of the marked inflammation our patients might have an unusual form of hereditary IBM.</p><p>In order to characterize I B M further, additional tests have been developed. Recently, use of congophilic green birefringent amyloid has been described in sporadic I B M <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">21]</ref>, but also in familial I B M <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Moreover, as in our case 2, vacuolated myofibres have been found to be immunoreactive for ubiquitin <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Reactivity for b -a m yloid protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, amyloid precursor protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, A l z h e i m e r ' s neuronal Alz-50 antigen <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and alpha-1 antichymotrypsin <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> have been described, but b -A 4 was negative in our case 2. Similar reactions to ubiquitin <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, a m y l o i d precursor protein, b -A 4 a m y l o i d and even cathepsins D and B were not only observed in muscle specimens of IBM, but also in those of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In other familial myopathies with r i m m e d vacuoles such as the "vacuolar myopathies" sparing the quadriceps <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and autosomal-recessive distal m y o p a t h y with r i m m e d vacuoles <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, rare intranuclear aggregates of filaments have also been seen.</p><p>As a rule, for unknown reasons patients with sporadic and familial IBM do not respond to immunosuppressive treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Occasionally, there may be transient yet mild improvement on high-dose corticosteroids (Dr. M. Dalakas, personal communication). Our patients experienced clear and longstanding benefit from immunosuppressive drugs and remained clinically stable during the follow-up periods of 24 months (case 1) and 6 months (case 2). Dysphagia improved significantly and more rapidly than weakness of limb muscles. The latter showed moderate improvement of muscle strength. Although transient and mild clinical improvement on steroids may also be observed as an unspecific effect in dystrophic myopathies, the longstanding benefit on azathioprine alone (case 1) argues strongly for the specific immunosuppres-sire effect in this case. Recently, successful treatment of some cases of IBM with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> has indicated that this mode of immunotherapy in IBM may be more promising than previously thought, although failure to improve has recently been noted in two patients so treated(K.V. Toyka and D. Pongratz, 1993, unpublished data). It remains unclear whether a response to immunosuppressive drugs is a characteristic feature of the hereditary form of IBM reported here, but its apparent benefit prompts us to recommend a trial with immunosuppressive treatment in otherwise typical cases of familial IBM.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. l Case 1 .Fig. 3</head><label>13</label><figDesc>Fig. l Case 1.
