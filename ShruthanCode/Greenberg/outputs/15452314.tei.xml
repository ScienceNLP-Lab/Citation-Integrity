<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Mutant ubiquitin (UBB ϩ1 ), a product of "molecular misreading," is toxic to cells because its ubiquitinated form inhibits the proteasome, contributing to accumulation of misfolded proteins and their ensuing toxicity. The authors demonstrate in 10 sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) muscle biopsies that UBB ϩ1 is accumulated in aggregates containing amyloid-␤ and phosphorylated-tau. In s-IBM, UBB ϩ1 may be pathogenic by inhibiting proteasome, thereby promoting accumulation of cytotoxic misfolded amyloid-␤ and phosphorylated-tau.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) is of unknown etiology and pathogenesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Its muscle biopsy features include 1) vacuolated muscle fibers; 2) intramuscle fiber multiprotein aggregates (inclusions); and 3) various degrees of mononuclear cell inflammation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The s-IBM muscle fiber phenotype has similarities to the Alzheimer disease (AD) brain, including accumulation of several AD characteristic proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Two major types of intracellular aggregates in s-IBM muscle fibers contain either amyloid-␤ (A␤) or phosphorylatedtau (p-tau), <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> and both types are ubiquitinated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> They stain with Congo red, crystal violet, and thioflavin-S, indicating they contain proteins in alternate conformation ("misfolded") that are assembled in the ␤-pleated sheet configuration of amyloid. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> s-IBM aggregates occur mainly in vacuole-free cytoplasm of vacuolated muscle fibers and in the cytoplasm of the nonvacuolated muscle fibers.</p><p>Both aggregate types contain several other proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Some, such as ␣-synuclein, also have a propensity to misfold and form ␤-sheet amyloid. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The "unfolded protein response" (UPR) recently was demonstrated in s-IBM muscle fibers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> UPR is considered a protective mechanism involving increased synthesis of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones in response to accumulated misfolded proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> The UPR strongly suggests that protein misfolding plays a role in s-IBM pathogenesis, including the intramyofiber formation of multiprotein aggregates.</p><p>"Molecular misreading," a newly recognized phenomenon, designates acquired, non-DNA-encoded dinucleotide deletions occurring within messenger RNA, resulting in production of potentially toxic mu-tant proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Aberrant transcripts are formed as a result of dinucleotide loss (⌬GA, ⌬GU) during or after transcription, and they can be translated from the deletion onward into the ϩ1 reading frame to produce abnormal proteins, e.g., mutant ubiquitin, termed UBB ϩ1 . UBB ϩ1 was shown accumulated in plaques (containing A␤) and neurofibrillary tangles (containing p-tau) of AD brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and in brains of some tauopathies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> UBB ϩ1 itself can become ubiquitinated, and that form inhibits the proteasome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> While some UBB ϩ1 transcripts are present in normal brains, UBB ϩ1 protein is accumulated only in brains of those with neurodegenerative disorders in which proteasomal inhibition has been proposed to play a pathogenetic role. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Accordingly, accumulated UBB ϩ1 was proposed to be a marker for proteasomal dysfunction in brain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Because misfolded proteins appear to play a role in s-IBM pathogenesis, 1,2 we asked whether UBB ϩ1 accumulates in s-IBM protein aggregates.</p><p>Materials and methods. Muscle biopsies. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously 2,5 on 10-m transverse sections of fresh-frozen diagnostic muscle biopsies obtained, with informed consent, from 27 patients with s-IBM (10), dermatomyositis (3), polymyositis (2), morphologically nonspecific myopathy (3), denervation (6), and normal muscle (3). All s-IBM biopsies met diagnostic criteria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> All 10 s-IBM muscle biopsies had 10 age-matched controls; the rest of the control subjects were younger patients.</p><p>Light microscopic immunocytochemistry. UBB ϩ1 was localized using three well-characterized rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the C-terminus of the UBB ϩ1 sequence: Ubi 2 ϩ1 (140994) and Ubi2A (180398) against epitope RQDHHPGSGAQ, and Ubi3 (050897) against epitope YADLREDPDRQDHHPGS-GAQ, 4 diluted 1:50 to 700.

Specificity of those antibodies was described, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and in our immunoblots they recognized only UBB ϩ1 (see figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Double immunofluorescence used antibodies against UBB ϩ1 in combination with one of these mouse monoclonal antibodies: 1) antibody against wild-type (WT) ubiquitin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), diluted 1:100; 2) antibody 6E10 (Signet, Dedham, MA), diluted 1:100, which recognizes A␤ in IBM muscle fibers; 5 and 3) antibody SMI-31 (Sternberger Monoclonals, Inc., Baltimore, MD), diluted 1:1000, which recognizes p-tau in s-IBM muscle fibers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> To block nonspecific binding of an antibody to Fc receptors, sections were preincubated with normal goat or rabbit serum diluted 1:10, as described previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Controls for staining specificity were omission of the primary antibody, its replacement with nonimmune sera or irrelevant antibody, and absorption of Ubi 2 ϩ1 (140994) antibody with UBB ϩ1 peptide-these were all negative.</p><p>Immuno-electronmicroscopy was done on 10-m unfixed frozen sections. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> For double immunolocalization, sections were incubated concurrently in a rabbit polyclonal antibody against UBB ϩ1 combined with a mouse monoclonal antibody: 6E10, SMI31, or antibody against WT ubiquitin.

To confirm specificity of the UBB ϩ1 antibodies, immunoblots were performed.

After electrophoresis, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then immunoprobed with antibodies against WT ubiquitin and UBB ϩ1 (see figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The blots were developed with the Western Breeze chemiluminescent kit (Invitrogen) for film exposure.

In all s-IBM biopsies, on a given cross-section, 70 to 80% of the vacuolated muscle fibers contained, mainly in their nonvacuolated cytoplasm, strong UBB ϩ1 immunoreactivity in the form of numerous well-defined, varioussized, plaquelike, dotty, or elongated aggregates (figure <ref type="figure">2,  A and B</ref>). Additionally, 10 to 15% of the nonvacuolated, otherwise normal-appearing (on a given cross-section) fibers contained similar aggregates. In all abnormal muscle fibers, aggregates immunoreactive for UBB ϩ1 were concurrently immunoreactive with antibodies against WT ubiquitin (recognizing an epitope on the first 75 amino acids of UBB ϩ1 ), A␤, or p-tau (figure <ref type="figure">2, C-H</ref>).</p><p>Other diseased and normal human muscle.

Our studies demonstrate that UBB ϩ1 accumulates within s-IBM muscle fibers, where it is associated with aggregates containing WT ubiquitin and either A␤ or p-tau. Those associations suggest that UBB ϩ1 may influence formation of the aggregates. One mechanism involved in formation of cellular aggregates composed of misfolded proteins is through inhibition of the "ubiquitin-proteasome system" (UPS). <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> UPS is the main degradation pathway for proteins, especially short-lived normal, misfolded, or otherwise damaged proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Degradation processes occurring through the 26S proteasome are ubiquitin dependent because most proteins must become conjugated to a polyubiquitin chain before entering and being degraded by the proteasome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Inhibition of proteasome function leads to accumulation of misfolded proteins and their ensuing cytotoxicity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Function of the proteasome is influenced by various cellular factors, including aging, oxidative stress, and misfolded proteins. Impaired proteasomal function has been proposed to contribute importantly to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> UBB ϩ1 , a product of molecular misreading, cannot ubiquitinate target proteins because of replacement of the essential C-terminal glycine (G76) with a 20-amino acid residue (ϩ1) extension. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> However, UBB ϩ1 itself can be ubiquitinated by WT ubiquitin, which binds to lysine residues in UBB ϩ1 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Polyubiquitinated UBB ϩ1 can accumulate and, if present in high levels, inhibits the 26S proteasome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Our study showing accumulation of UBB ϩ1 in s-IBM muscle fibers is the first demonstration in diseased human muscle of "molecular misreading" causing translation of a mutant protein. We propose that the aging cellular environment of s-IBM muscle fibers, combined with oxidative stress 1 and perhaps other detrimental molecular events, leads to abnormal production and accumulation of UBB ϩ1 . We suggest that UBB ϩ1 -inhibited proteasome cannot properly degrade several proteins, including A␤ and p-tau, resulting in their accumulation and aggregation.</p><p>Also in s-IBM muscle fibers, increased synthesis of A␤ precursor protein (A␤PP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> is associated with abnormal processing of A␤PP 1 and accumulation of its cytotoxic fragment A␤, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> which can further contribute to 26S proteasome inhibition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> P-tau also can inhibit proteasome function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Our recent demonstration in s-IBM muscle fibers of large and small aggresomes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> considered to result from proteasome inhibition, 10 further supports our proposal that proteasome inhibition and protein misfolding play a novel role in s-IBM pathogenesis.
