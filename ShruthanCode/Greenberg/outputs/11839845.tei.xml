<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: An important aspect of inclusion-body myositis (IBM) vacuolated muscle fibers (VMF) is abnormal accumulation of amyloid-␤ precursor protein (A␤PP) epitopes and its product, amyloid-␤ (A␤), and of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in the form of paired helical filaments. Lipoprotein receptors and cholesterol are known to play an important role in A␤PP processing, A␤ production, and tau phosphorylation. Methods: In 10 IBM and 22 control muscle biopsies the authors immunolocalized low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), and colocalized them with A␤, p-tau, APOE, and free cholesterol. Results: In each biopsy, virtually all IBM VMF had strong LDLR-immunoreactive inclusions, which colocalized with A␤, APOE, p-tau, and free cholesterol. VLDLR was increased mainly diffusely, but in approximately 50% of the VMF it was also accumulated in the form of inclusions colocalizing with A␤, APOE, and free cholesterol, but not with p-tau. LRP inclusions were present in a few VMF. In all myopathies, a subset of regenerating and necrotizing muscle fibers had prominent diffuse accumulation of both LDLR and free cholesterol. At normal neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) postsynaptically, LDLR and VLDLR, but not LRP, were immunoreactive. Conclusions: 1) Abnormal accumulation of LDLR, VLDLR, LRP, and cholesterol within IBM vacuolated muscle fibers suggests novel roles for them in the IBM pathogenesis. 2) Expression of LDLR and VLDLR at normal NMJ suggests physiologic roles for them in transsynaptic signaling pathways, increased internalization of lipoproteins there, or both. 3) Increased LDLR and free cholesterol in some regenerating and necrotizing muscle fibers suggest a role for them in human muscle fiber growth and repair and necrotic death.</p></div>

Median age was 60 years for IBM patients and 61 years for control subjects. Median total serum cholesterol levels were 214 mg/dL for IBM patients and 220 mg/dL for control subjects. One IBM patient who previously had hypercholesterolemia was taking pravastatin; his current cholesterol is 214 mg/dL.

Briefly, a stock solution containing 2.5 mg/mL filipin complex (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored in the dark at Ϫ20 °C. Unfixed or paraformaldehyde-fixed sections of fresh-frozen muscle biopsies were incubated with filipin diluted 1:75 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark. Subsequently, sections were rinsed in PBS, mounted in glycerol-PBS, and examined under the Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope using a G-365 exciter filter and LP-420 barrier filter (Carl Zeiss, Germany). In double-labeled fluorescence experiments, sections were first immunostained for LDLR, VLDLR, A␤, p-tau, or desmin, and then were processed for filipin staining.

It is not known whether the relative paucity of LRPpositive muscle fibers reflects 1) more limited expression of LRP, as compared with LDLR and VLDLR; 2) relative inaccessibility of LRP epitopes to the antibodies we used; or 3) LRP instability in our tissue.

Accordingly, LDLR and VLDLR, and perhaps LRP to a lesser extent, either alone or in association with their cargo molecules APOE and cholesterol, may play a role in the IBM-pathogenic cascade.</p><p>Colocalization of APOE with the accumulated LDLR and VLDLR suggests the following: 1) the dissociation of APOE from its LDL receptors that normally follow endocytosis 7 might be inhibited in the IBM pathogenic process; 2) APOE together with its receptor becomes trapped within the abnormal muscle fibers, possibly because of the known ability of APOE to bind to both A␤ and p-tau <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> ; or 3) APOE, LDLR, and VLDLR each bind independently to A␤ and the first two (but not VLDLR) also bind to p-tau.</p><p>Cholesterol is a component of native apoEcontaining lipoprotein particles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> With filipin cytochemistry, we demonstrated that IBM VMF contained accumulations of free (non-esterified) cholesterol that colocalized with LDLR and VLDLR immunoreactive inclusions, as well as with A␤ and phosphorylated tau. This may suggest that in IBM abnormal muscle fibers, the increased accumulation of free cholesterol may represent another consequence, in addition to APOE accumulation, of the increased expression and ectopic accumulation of LDLR and, to a lesser degree, of VLDLR. Whether other mechanisms known to regulate intracellular free cholesterol content <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> are also involved in IBM muscle fibers is not known.</p><p>A possible pathogenic role that abnormally accumulated free cholesterol may play in IBM muscle fibers can be considered. By biochemistry, in normal mammalian brain and various types of cultured cells, A␤PP and A␤ are concentrated in the cholesterol-rich domains of the plasmalemma and intracellular membranes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> Cholesterol influences A␤PP processing resulting in increased A␤ production, binds to A␤ and, by altering A␤ conformation, appears to enhance its amyloidogenic properties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> Experimental loading of cultured cells with free cholesterol caused increased generation of A␤ from A␤PP, whereas cholesterol-depletion exerted the opposite effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> The mechanism by which cholesterol influences A␤PP processing is not known, but one possibility may involve direct or indirect inhibition of an ␣-secretase, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> such as ADAM10 (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10). <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> Experimentally altered intracellular trafficking of cholesterol in cultured cells causes co-accumulation of aggregated A␤ and free cholesterol in the same intracellular deposits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> We propose that within IBM abnormal muscle fibers, cholesterol instead of being properly metabolized <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> is deposited in association with LDLR, VLDLR, LRP, and apoE at site(s) of A␤ accumulation and possibly at sites of A␤PP processing.

Because focal accumulations of free cholesterol also colocalized with p-tau in the IBM VMFs, it is possible that cholesterol also influenced tau phosphorylation and PHFs formation, as it is known to do in the Niemann-Pick type C disease brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> and in cell culture. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> Whether accumulated free cholesterol induces other pathogenic consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> in IBM muscle fibers, including altered gene expression, 1 remains to be elucidated.</p><p>LDLR, VLDLR, and LRP may also play a role in the IBM pathogenesis independently of their ligands. For example, LRP can directly bind to membraneassociated or extracellularly secreted A␤PP and can promote A␤ production. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> LRP and A␤PP interaction, involving the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain of 751-A␤PP, occurs at the extracellular portions of both proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> In IBM, 751-A␤PP is overproduced and accumulated intracellularly in abnormal muscle fibers, as are A␤PP-mRNA and congophilic amyloid containing A␤. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Thus, in IBM the effects of the LDLR family members and cholesterol on the A␤PP-A␤ system presumably are intracellular. Although direct binding to A␤PP appears to be a property of LRP, it is possible that LDLR and VLDLR may indirectly influence A␤PP trafficking and processing through modulating cytoplasmic adaptor proteins, such as Disabled-1 (Dab-1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> Within IBM abnormal fibers, a possible influence of LDLR and VLDLR on A␤PP metabolism is supported by their light microscopic colocalization with A␤, and their intracellular accumulation on 6-to 10-nm amyloid-like fibrils and amorphous material, both of which were previously demonstrated by immuno-electron microscopy to contain A␤. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> In the current study, LDLR in IBM fibers colocalized with p-tau, suggesting that it might directly or indirectly enhance formation of the tau-containing PHFs. VLDLR did not colocalize with p-tau, but was rather diffusely increased in IBM vacuolated muscle fibers. It might increase formation of PHFs by indirectly promoting tau phosphorylation (which is considered a prelude to formation of PHFs). VLDLR is known to participate in intracellular signal transduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> and appears to indirectly target cdk5, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> which when activated may play a role in IBM-tau phosphorylation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> (Although our observed changes in cholesterol and lipoprotein receptors could be nonspecific related to cell damage from an unknown cause, we consider this less likely.) In several ways analogous to our proposal regarding IBM, LDLR family members recently have been proposed to participate in AD pathogenesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Diffuse cytoplasmic increase of LDLR and free cholesterol in a subset of regenerating muscle fibers in all myopathies may reflect their increased demand for cholesterol, and possibly for some of their other ligands, during muscle fiber growth and repair. Human regenerating muscle fibers have increased APOE immunoreactivity. A subset of them has increased APOE mRNA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> indicating that in some stages of muscle fiber growth/repair APOE is synthesized within those fibers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> whereas in other stages it presumably is transported into the fiber. Much remains to be learned regarding the roles LDLR, APOE, and cholesterol in muscle-fiber growth and differentiation. Muscle fibers undergoing necrosis also had diffusely increased cytoplasmic free cholesterol and LDLR. Whether those components have a causative role in this common form of muscle fiber death is not known. In all muscle biopsies, LDLR and VLDLR, but not LRP, were concentrated at the postsynaptic domain of NMJ (as are several other proteins 1 pathologically accumulated in IBM fibers). This is in agreement with our previous immunolocalization of APOE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> at NMJ, and with data of others demonstrating active endocytosis at the NMJ. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> Our results suggest a previously unrecognized function of the normal NMJ in delivery of lipoproteins into the muscle fibers. Based on their anatomic location, LDLR and VLDLR may be involved in nerve-muscle signal transduction, communication, and trophic interaction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3.
