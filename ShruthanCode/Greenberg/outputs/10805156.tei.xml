<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>At a 1-day symposium held by the Registry of Toxi- cologic Pathology for Animals in Washington, D.C., in conjunction with the 18th annual conference of the So- ciety of Toxicologic Pathologists, current animal models for various human neurodegenerative diseases were presented. These animal models demonstrate promise for the evaluation of new treatments and elucidation of mechanisms of pathogenesis for the various diseases under study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRIMATE MODEL OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE</head><p>Dr Krys Bankiewicz at the National Institute of Neu- rological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health is comparing neurochemical, neuroanatomical, and clinical changes of Parkinson's disease (PD) in 2 groups of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) that are the subjects of ongoing studies. One of the groups of mon- keys was given unilateral infusions of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) via the intracarotid ar- tery (ICA). The other group of monkeys was given uni- lateral ICA injection of MPTP followed by sequential systemic doses of the toxin. The monkeys given ICA in- fusions alone developed nigrostriatal pathway degeneration ipsilateral to the site of injection and severe hemi- parkinson's disease that affected the contralateral side of the body. In contrast, the monkeys that were given se- quential systemic doses of MPTP in addition to unilateral ICA administration of the drug develop bilateral nigrostriatal pathway damage and various levels of clinical signs, depending on the total dose of MPTP given. This second group of overlesioned monkeys had histopathologic, neurophysiologic, and clinical features in common with human patients with PD. Dr Bankiewicz's research group is using positron emis- sion tomography (PET) and a dopamine tracer to ascer- tain the relationship between dopamine metabolism and the clinical stage of disease in the hemiparkinsonian mon- keys and the overlesioned monkeys that received ICA injection and various systemic dosages of MPTP The re- search group is also assessing the relationship of tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry (as a measure of nerve cell loss in the substantia nigra) to clinical disease signs and PET results. Clinical response to sinemet (L- dopa/carbidopa) is also being assessed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODEL FOR TESTING POLIOVIRUS VACCINE NEUROVIRULENCE</head><p>For more than 40 years, the monkey neurovirulence test was used to monitor for toxic effects caused by live oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) preparations produced in cell cultures. Monkeys are the only natural animal model suitable for such testing because primates are the only animals that are consistently susceptible to poliovirus. Such testing in these animals was expensive, laborious, and even dangerous to some degree. Identification of the poliovirus receptor protein on the surfaces of infected primate cells has allowed for sequencing of the receptor gene and its insertion in transgenic mice, causing these mice to be susceptible to poliovirus infection. Transgenic mice that harbor the human poliovirus receptor within their genomes can have receptor distinction between wild type and attenuated poliovirus. Different lines of the transgenic TgPVR mice, which contain different numbers of the receptor inserts, are now mass produced at the Central Institute of Experimental Animals in Tokyo.</p><p>Dr Eugenia Dragunsky's research group at the US Food and Drug Administration is using one of these transgenic mouse lines (TgPVR21) in mouse neuroviru- lence testing of OPV. Paralysis develops in these mice after intraspinal inoculation of poliovirus. The severity of histologic lesions in these mice correlates directly with the clinical severity of disease. Thus, the need for time- consuming histopathologic examination of central ner- vous system (CNS) tissue for signs of viral virulence that is required in monkeys is eliminated in these mice, saving time and expense. Dr Dragunsky's lab has observed com- plete correlation of neurovirulence test results for differ- ent vaccine lots in the mice and monkeys. Investigators in a World Health Organization study have evaluated TgPVR21 mice for control of neurovirulence of all 3 types of OPV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MONKEY MODELS OF COGNITIVE DECLINE WITH AGING OR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE</head><p>Dr Mary Lou Voytko's research group in the Department of Pathology and Comparative Medicine, Wakefo- rest University School of Medicine, is evaluating 2 populations of monkeys with the aim of determining the neu- ral basis of cognitive decline caused by aging and estro- gen loss.</p><p>Surgically menopausal cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were examined to determine whether loss of estrogen led to the same symptoms of cognitive decline in the monkeys that some postmenopausal women ex- perience. The group of young monkeys selected for study was trained and tested for a variety of behaviors that as- sess their mental abilities and motor skills. The monkeys were retested after removal of their ovaries. They were then given either estrogen or a placebo and were again tested for cognitive and motor abilities at various times after treatment was instituted. The researchers found that there was no decline in memory or learning ability with a decrease in estrogen level. The researchers did, how- ever, find that attention abilities were markedly reduced with a loss of estrogen after surgery. Attention improved in the group of monkeys that were supplemented with estrogen but continued to decline in the group that re- ceived the placebo. PET was used to assess the integrity of the cholinergic and dopaminergic systems within the brains of the monkeys by evaluating binding of ligands to the acetylcholine transporter and D2 receptors, respec- tively. Binding of the ligands in both neurochemical systems was reduced with estrogen loss but improved with estrogen supplementation.</p><p>The second primate animal model with which Dr Voytko works is a population of aged rhesus monkeys. These monkeys were evaluated for impaired cognitive function associated with increased age to determine their value as a model for the study of cognitive decline in aged hu- mans. The performance of the monkeys in all areas of cognitive and motor function paralleled the performance of elderly people in those same types of behaviors. The old monkeys exhibited no loss of motor skill (as judged by reaction time) and no loss of attention ability when compared with younger monkeys. There was quite a bit of individual variability in the old monkeys in terms of learning ability. Some of the old monkeys performed as well as young monkeys at this test, but other old monkeys performed considerably worse. All of the old monkeys had more difficulty with learning spatial location than did young monkeys. However, as with general learning abil- ity, once spatial location was learned the old monkeys differed greatly in their ability to remember the location.</p><p>PET showed an age-related decrease in binding of the cholingeric ligand in the basal ganglia in some, but not all, of the old monkeys as compared with young mon- keys. Binding of the dopaminergic ligand to D2 receptors was uniformly decreased in all of the old monkeys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MOUSE MODELS OF AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS</head><p>Of the 10% of cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gerhig's disease) that are familial, 20% are caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD]) gene. SOD] encodes for the cytosolic form of the enzyme SOD, which binds with the harmful super- oxide free radical. SOD 1 requires copper and zinc as co- factors to perform this scavenging function. Fifty differ- ent missense mutations in the 53 amino acids that make up the polypeptide within the homodimer SOD have been found in various patients with ALS. In many of these patients, various levels of SOD function remain. Transgenic mouse models have been developed to deter- mine whether these mutations cause disease by a loss of function of the enzyme or a gain of toxic effect within the enzyme. Studies involving these mice point to a gain of toxic effect as the cause of disease; some lines of the transgenic mice exhibit signs of disease in the presence of very high functional levels of SOD1. Moreover, knock-out mice that lack SOD 1 do not exhibit disease.</p><p>Dr Philip Wong's laboratory at Johns Hopkins Uni- versity is examining the role of copper and its chaperone (CCS) in the pathogenesis of SOD 1-linked cases of ALS.</p><p>To first demonstrate that CCS is required to deliver copper to mammalian SOD1, knock-out mice for the CCS gene were created. These mice were viable and had normal levels of SOD1, but they showed marked reduction of SOD1 enzymatic activity as compared with mice that were hemizygous or homozygous for the wild-type CCS gene. To next test whether copper in the mutant SOD 1 enzyme is necessary to cause disease, breeding pairs were established to generate CCS-deficient/SODl mutant mice. If copper is required for mutant SOD 1 expression and disease, the disease phenotype should be absent in these CCS-deficient mice, which have no way to deliver copper to mutant SOD 1. The results of these breeding studies will be available later this year. The results will determine whether copper and its altered delivery via its chaperone are the culprits in SOD1-linked cases of ALS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MOUSE MODELS OF POLYGLUTAMINE DISEASES</head><p>Dr Christopher Ross's laboratory at Johns Hopkins University has developed transgenic mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) and dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in collaboration with Dr Da- vid Borchelt's laboratory (also at Johns Hopkins). These disorders are 2 of a group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases that are caused by expanded CAG repeats in open reading frames of affected genes and are char- acterized by involuntary movements and incoodination, a progressive cognitive disorder, and often emotional fea- tures. These CAG expansions result in the production of polyglutamine. The mechanism by which polyglutamine is involved in neurodegeneration in these and other polyglutamine diseases is unknown at this point. Because pa- tients with both HD and DRPLA exhibit abnormal pro- tein aggregates and intranuclear inclusions within dam- aged neurons, it has been hypothesized that abnormal proteolytic cleavage products result in neuronal cell death.</p><p>The transgenic mouse models that have been devel- oped for these 2 conditions have cDNA inserts that are expressed by means of the prion protein promoter. For the HD transgenic mouse, the insert encodes the first 171 1 amino acids of the HD gene product, huntingtin. For the DRPLA transgenic mouse, the insert encodes the entire DRPLA gene product, atrophin-1. Transgenic mice with either normal or abnormal constructs of the genes have been made. The mice with normal HD and DRPLA inserts are phenotypically normal, whereas mice with ab- normal inserts exhibit a progressive disease phenotype that results in death. In both groups of affected mice, intranuclear inclusions within damaged neurons stain with antibodies to the abnormal protein products and with antibodies to ubiquitin. In the HD mice, there are also abnormal protein aggregates in axons and dendrites, as is the case with human HD patients. Western blots of neu- ronal nuclear fractions from affected DRPLA transgenic mice demonstrate increased levels of a protein of lower molecular weight than full-length atrophin-1. The data indicate that proteolytic processing, protein aggregation, and nuclear localization of the aggregates are involved in disease pathogenesis. Morphometric studies to assess the degree of neuronal loss are underway in both mouse models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRANSGENIC MODELS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE</head><p>Dr David Borchelt's laboratory at Johns Hopkins Uni- versity has generated transgenic mice to examine the role of presenilins and apolipoprotein E in amyloid deposition and generation of Alzheimer's disease. Missense muta- tions in the 2 related genes, presenilin 1 (PSI ) and presenilin 2 (PS2), have been shown to be at the root of the dementia that develops in certain pedigrees with early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). The altered gene products that result from these mutations change the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and lead to elevated levels of Ar31-42 peptides that form deposits in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. This finding has been substantiated in transgenic mice that harbor both the FAD-linked human PSI mutation and a chimeric human/ mouse gene for APP that incorporates mutant APP dis- covered in a Swedish pedigree with FAD. These mice with inserts for both mutations develop a great number of amyloid deposits at a much earlier age than do trans- genic mice that have constructs for normal human PS 1 and mutant APP or mice that harbor only the abnormal gene for APR Numerous other studies in humans have suggested that different alleles of apolipoprotein E (Apo E) influence the rate of amyloid production and deposition in the brains of people. The E4 allele is found more often that the other alleles of Apo E in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, and affected individuals with this allele exhibit greater accumulations of amyloid than do Alzheimer's patients with the Apo E2 and the Apo E3 alleles. The Borchelt research group found, however, that transgenic mice that overexpress Apo E4 could not be distinguished from their nontransgenic litter mates. They also observed that the presence of the Apo E4 gene in transgenic mice did not accelerate amyloid deposition in mice that also harbor the mutant APP gene vs transgenic mice that harbor the mu- tant APP gene alone. These data suggest that although Apo E4 influences other aspects of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's patients, it has far less impact on amyloid deposition in the brains of these patients than do the pre- senilins.</p><p>MOUSE MODELS OF INCLUSION BODY MYOSITIS, HEREDITARY MYELINOPATHY, AND CREUTZFELD-JAKOB DISEASE Dr Kondi Wong at the Armed Forces Institute of Pa- thology, in collaboration with others, is working with a number of transgenic and natural animal models of neu- romuscular degeneration. His research group is using a transgenic mouse model in which the cellular wild-type prion-related protein gene, PrPc, is overexpressed. The overexpression of this membrane protein gene in muscle in these mice results in a myopathy that resembles inclu- sion body myositis in humans. As in human patients, the mice exhibit basophilic nuclear inclusions, rimmed vac- uoles, tubulofilamentous structures (in which PrPc and B- amyloid colocalize), and mitochondrial abnormalities.</p><p>Trembler and Trembler-J mice are being studied as nat- urally occurring animal models for Charcot-Marie Tooth (CMT) syndrome, which is also known as hereditary mo- tor and sensory neuropathy type I (HMSN I). These mice exhibit hypomyelination from birth. Myelin that is pro- duced does not compact normally. The mice have a mu- tation in the peripheral myelin protein (PMP-22) gene. This gene on chromosome 17 in humans is being eval- uated as the candidate gene for CMT type Ia. PMP-22 knock-out mice have also been created to study the effects of mutations in this candidate gene for CMT type Ia, Dejerine Sottas disease (DSS), and hypertrophic neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. In mice that are heterozygous for the gene knock-out, nerve conduction is mildly slowed and numerous perineural collagen cuffs (tomaculi) are seen. In homozygous knock-out mice, demyelination is severe and nerve con- duction velocity is markedly slowed.</p><p>The peripheral myelin Po gene is the candidate gene for CMT type Ib and DSS. This gene product appears to function as an adhesion molecule that is necessary for stable apposition of myelin membranes. Gene disruption methods have been used to create heterozygous and ho- mozygous Po-deficient mice. Disruption of both copies of the Po gene in these mice leads to severe demyelination that does not improve. Disruption of only 1 copy of the gene yields mice that begin to exhibit problems with demyelination and slowing of nerve conduction af- ter the age of 4 months. Dr Wong's laboratory is also using transgenic mice to elucidate the mechanism of pathogenesis in the prion dis- ease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS). The GSS transgenic mouse has an insert that consists of 60 copies of the affected portion of the mouse equivalent of the GSS gene. A single amino acid substitution in the gene creates the mutation. Overexpression of the mutant gene in these mice results in a clinical phenotype similar to that in affected humans. Slightly less than half of the mice have characteristic spiny, Congo red-positive, protease-resistant GSS-type plaques in brain tissue. Trans- genic mice that harbor smaller numbers of the transgene do not exhibit CNS dysfunction. The research group has also generated prion protein knock-out mice, in which the normal cellular prion-like protein is missing. Complete loss of the gene does not allow prions to propagate within cells. These mice remained healthy for more than 500 days after inoculation with murine scrapie prions. Het- erozygous knock-out mice developed neurologic signs af- ter more than 400 days postinoculation. Wild-type mice, with no gene knock-out, developed scrapie by day 165 postinoculation.</p></div>		</body>
