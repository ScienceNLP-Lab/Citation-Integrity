<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLINICAL FEATURES OF SPORADIC INCLUSION BODY MYOSITIS</head><p>sIBM is the most common acquired myopathy in patients above the age of 50 years, and it affects men slightly more often than it does women. Its prevalence is estimated at between 4.3 and 9.3 per 1,000,000, rising to 35.3 per 1,000,000 for people over the age of 50 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) presents with a characteristic clinical phenotype of slow-onset weakness and atrophy, affecting proximal and distal limb muscles and facial and pharyngeal muscles. Histologically, sIBM is characterized by chronic myopathic features, lymphocytic infiltrates invading non-vacuolated fibers, vacuolar degeneration, and accumulation of amyloid-related proteins. The cause of sIBM is unclear, but two processes-one autoimmune and the other degenerative-appear to occur in parallel. In contrast to dystrophies, in sIBM the autoinvasive CD8 + T cells are cytotoxic and antigen-driven, invading muscle fibers expressing major histocompatibility complex class I antigen and costimulatory molecules. The concurrent degenerative features include vacuolization, filamentous inclusions and intracellular accumulations of amyloid-β-related molecules. Although viruses have not been amplified from the muscle fibers, at least 12 cases of sIBM have been seen in association with retroviral infections, indicating that a chronic persistent viral infection might be a potential triggering factor. Emerging data imply that continuous upregulation of cytokines and major histocompatibility complex class I on the muscle fibers causes an endoplasmic reticulum stress response, resulting in intracellular accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins and activation of the transcription factor NFκB, leading to further cytokine activation. In spite of the brisk, antigen-driven T-cell infiltrates, sIBM does not respond to immunotherapies. New therapies using monoclonal antibodies against lymphocyte signaling pathways might prove helpful in arresting disease progression.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is one of the three main subsets of inflammatory myopathies, the other two being polymyositis and dermatomyositis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> All of these conditions are characterized by inflammation in the endo mysium (hence the term inflammatory myo pathies), muscle fiber necrosis, elevation of serum muscle enzymes and a varying degree of muscle weakness. Dermatomyositis can occur in children and adults, has a subacute onset, and affects muscles and skin. Polymyositis is also a subacute myopathy that affects adults but rarely affects children, and presents with proximal muscle weakness. By contrast, sIBM is a slowly progressive myopathy that affects proximal and distal muscles, and has a distinctive histopathology characterized by autoimmune inflammatory features combined with degenerative features, such as vacuoles, filamentous inclusions (hence the term inclusion body myositis) and accumulation of amyloid-related proteins.</p><p>sIBM is often misdiagnosed as polymyositis or other diseases, and is frequently only suspected retrospectively when a patient with presumed polymyositis does not respond to therapies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> This became evident 15 years ago when we began recruiting patients who had been diagnosed with therapy-resistant polymyositis to a controlled study that investigated treatment with highdose intravenous immunoglobulin. This study was never completed, because it transpired that most of the patients actually had sIBM.</p><p>This review outlines our current knowledge of sIBM, including clinical presentation, diagnosis, pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies. sIBM causes weakness and atrophy of the distal and proximal muscles, and involvement of quadriceps and deep finger flexors are clues to early diagnosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Patients often present with falls because their knees collapse owing to quadriceps muscle weakness, or with difficulty performing certain tasks, such as turning keys, tying knots and holding golf clubs, owing to weakness of finger flexors. Neck flexors and extensors are frequently affected; head drop and camptocormia are rare manifestations. Dysphagia occurs in up to 60% of patients with sIBM, leading to choking episodes. Facial muscle weakness is common and at times prominent, although the extraocular muscles are not affected. Sensory function is usually normal; mildly diminished vibratory sensation at the ankles is sometimes observed, but this is presumed to be age-related, or attributable to a comorbidity. The tendon reflexes, although preserved early in the disease, can diminish in the late stages as the atrophy of major muscle groups becomes evident. The distal weakness does not represent a neurogenic process, but rather a primary myopathy that affects proximal and distal muscles, as confirmed by macroelectromyography. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> The weakness and atrophy are sometimes asymmetric, resembling a lower motor neuron disease. Disease progression is slow but steady, and resembles that of a dystrophy. Most patients with sIBM require an assistive device, such as a cane, walker or wheelchair, within several years of onset. 9</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DIAGNOSIS OF SPORADIC INCLUSION BODY MYOSITIS</head><p>The clinical diagnosis of sIBM is confirmed by muscle biopsy, and is aided by electromyography (EMG) and determination of serum muscle enzyme levels. Creatine kinase levels can initially be elevated up to 10-fold, but they remain only slightly elevated as the disease progresses. EMG shows increased spontaneous activity, with fibrillations, complex repetitive discharges and positive sharp waves. The voluntary motor units are myopathic, with low-amplitude polyphasic units, usually of short (but, in a few rare cases, long) duration. MRI of the forearms and quadriceps might show the selective patterns of muscle involvement even before the manifestation of clinical signs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> but it is of limited diagnostic value.</p><p>Muscle biopsy is essential for diagnosis: from the outset, there are signs of chronicity character ized by hypertrophic, atrophic and split fibers with internal nuclei and increased connective tissue, indicating that the disease process has begun long before the patient seeks medical attention. The main histological features are multifocal lymphocytic infiltrates invading non-necrotic muscle fibers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> vacuoles in fibers not invaded by lymphocytes (these 'rimmed vacuoles' contain basophilic granular deposits, consisting of membranous whorls, around the edges), and Congo-red-positive amyloid deposits. The amyloid deposits are best visualized with Texas red fluorescent filters, but can also be seen quite clearly with crystal violet (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,B</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Abnormal mitochondria characterized by ragged red fibers or cytochrome-oxidase-negative fibers are frequent (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). Electron microscopy reveals accumulation of 15-21 nm tubulofilamentous inclusions and cytoplasmic collections of 6-10 nm amyloid-like filaments that immunoreact with various amyloid-proteinrelated antibodies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Abnormal myo nuclei with intranuclear 7 nm-wide filaments are also detected in up to 3.5% of the nuclei, but their significance in vacuolar formation remains unclear. The vacuoles are not unique to sIBM, and are also seen in other myopathies, such as dysferlinopathies, myofibrillar myopathies, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and Emery-Dreifus muscular dystrophy, and even in chronic neurogenic conditions such as old poliomyelitis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> The vacuoles are most easily identified on frozen sections stained with hematoxyli n and eosin or trichrome stain; paraffin processing dissolves the granular material and the vacuoles are often missed. In some specimens, the inflammation or the vacuoles are sparse, necessitating a second biopsy from a different site.</p><p>If a patient has the typical clinical phenotype of sIBM, but the muscle biopsy shows only features of a chronic inflammatory myopathy (inflammation, large fibers, splitting, and increased connective tissue, but no vacuoles), the diagnosis is probable sIBM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> If, however, there is also strong upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens (see below), and amyloid deposits and cytochrome-oxidase-negative fibers are present (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), the diagnosis of sIBM is rather more certain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differential diagnosis</head><p>Shaking hands with a patient can provide the first indication of sIBM, because of the weak www.nature.com/clinicalpractice/neuro grip. If the patient complains of falls due to weakness at the knees and feet, has atrophic thighs, and does not report paresthesias or cramps, sIBM is very likely. Diagnostic dilemmas arise when the weakness and atrophy are slightly asymmetric or limited to the lower extremities, raising the possibility of a lower motor neuron disease. Motor neuron disorders, however, can be distinguished from IBM by the presence of hyper reflexia, cramps, fasciculations and large motor units on EMG.</p><p>sIBM is most often misdiagnosed as polymyositis, based on the simplistic view that creatine kinase elevation with endomysial inflammation denotes polymyositis. In contrast to sIBM, however, polymyositis starts subacutely (over weeks to months, compared with months to years in sIBM), causes proxi mal and sym metrical muscle weakness, and is often associated with higher creatine kinase levels. In addition, the biopsy lacks the chronicity signs of sIBM. The distinction between sIBM and the other, mostly hereditary vacuolar myopathies, such as myofibrillar myopathies or hereditary inclusion body myopathy with mutations in the glucosamine (UDP-N-acetyl)-2-epimerase/ N-acetyl mannosamine kinase (GNE) gene, might be more subtle because these myopathies also affect distal muscles and the vacuoles are identical to those of sIBM. Endomysial inflammation accompanied by MHC class I expression, and the aforementioned typical clinical phenotype in patients above the age of 50 years, should, however, point to sIBM. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISEASE MECHANISMS IN SPORADIC INCLUSION BODY MYOSITIS</head><p>sIBM is a complex disorder, the underlying cause of which is unclear. The observation that the intact muscle fibers are invaded by T lymphocytes, whereas the vacuolated fibers lack T-cell autoinvasion but show strong expression of MHC class I antigens, has led to the suggestion that two processes might occur in parallel: a primary immune process due to T-cell-mediated cyto toxicity, and a non-immune process character ized by vacuolization and intracellular accumulation of amyloid-related molecules, probably due to MHC class I-induced</p><p>stress. An interplay between inflammatory mediators and stressor or degenerative molecules is likely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunogenetics</head><p>Genetic factors are presumed to play a role in sIBM, on the basis of an association between sIBM and certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, especially the DRβ1*0301 and DQβ1*0201 alleles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> Alleles of the 8.1 ancestral haplotype in the center of the MHC class II region seem to confer susceptibility to IBM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> The B8-DR3-DR52-DQ2 haplotype is found in 67% of sIBM patients, similar to the frequency of this haplotype in myasthenia gravis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> The B8-DR3-DR52-DQ2 haplotype is also associated with earlier disease onset, indicating that immuno regulatory genes are inherently connected with the manifestation of symptoms. Apolipoprotein E ε4 has also been associated with sIBM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> but no linkage to amyloid precursor protein or prion protein genes has been observed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> The features of sIBM have been observed in siblings in several families, a condition that has been termed familial inflammatory sIBM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> These cases are distinct from the hereditary inclusion body myopathies (hIBM), a heterogeneous group of non-inflammatory, inherited syndromes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> A subset of hIBM that spares the quadriceps muscles results from mutations in the GNE gene. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Autoimmune features</head><p>Evidence for an autoimmune basis for sIBM is supported by numerous observations (Box 1), including association with other auto immune diseases, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> common variable immunodeficiency, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and autoantibodies in similar frequencies to those seen in classic auto immune disorders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Also, as in many other autoimmune disorders, sIBM occurs in family members of the same generation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> and there is a strong immunogenetic asso ciation, as described above. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> sIBM is associated with paraproteinemias in up to 22.8% of patients-much greater than the 2% frequency found in age-matched controls-indicating disturbed immunoregulation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> There is also an association with retroviruses (see below), <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> and evidence of formation of immunological synapses between autoinvasive cytotoxic T cells and muscle fibers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).

In sIBM, however, MHC class I is ubiquitously expressed even on muscle fibers remote from the inflammation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> In other chronic myopathies or dystrophies, MHC class I is either absent or only present in degenerating/regenerating fibers. Furthermore, in dystrophies, the few autoinvasive T cells are clonally diverse and do not express cytotoxicity markers. It is probable that in sIBM, cytokines are the main inducers of MHC class I expression, because in human myotubes, proinflammatory cytokines upregulate MHC class I. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> As we discuss later in the review, the chronic upregulation of MHC class I exerts a stressor effect in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which might lead to a self-sustaining T-cell response. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> The autoinvasive CD8 + cells contain perforin granules, which, on release, are known to induce cell necrosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> In sIBM, the perforin pathway, as opposed to the Fas-Fas-L-dependent apoptotic process, is the cytotoxic effector mechanism, in spite of the fact that Fas antigen is expressed on muscle fibers, and Fas-L is expressed on T cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> T cells recognize an antigen via the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the T-cell receptors (TCRs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> The TCRs form heterodimers of α and β chains encoded by multiple gene families. During T-cell development, billions of different TCRs are generated by rearrangement of TCR genes in the precursor T cells. The progeny of a single precursor cell is called a T-cell clone, and all members of the clone express the same antigen-specific TCR with unique nucleotide sequences in the CDR3 region. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> When exposed to the relevant antigen, a clone is stimulated to divide, leading to clonal expansion. In sIBM, but not in dermatomyositis or dystrophies, only T cells expressing certain TCR families are recruited to the muscle from the circulation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> Furthermore, the autoinvasive-but not the perivascular-T cells are clonally expanded, indicating that they are driven by specific antigens to invade the muscle fibers. Interestingly, such clonally expanded autoinvasive T cells persist over time, as confirmed with sequential muscle biopsies, even from different muscles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> The MHC class I molecules present antigenic peptides to TCRs of CD8 + cells only in the presence of costimulatory molecules and their counter-receptors. In sIBM, the costimulatory molecules BB1 (also known as CD80 or B7-1) and ICOSL are expressed on MHC class I-positive muscle fibers, and they make cell-to-cell contact with ligands on CD8 + cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> BB1 and ICOSL are induced by interferon-γ or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on human myoblasts, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> and might confer antigen-presenting-cell function on the muscle fibers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T-cell transmigration, cytokine signaling and chemokine receptors</head><p>Certain cytokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-2, IL-5, IL-10, TNF and transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β]) and chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1α, Mig and IP-10) are variably overexpressed in sIBM, and might contribute to costimulation, T-cell activation and trans migration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> The chemokine receptors CCR1-CCR5, CCR2A and CCR2B are up regulated on the endothelium and inflammatory cells, enhancing the local immune circuitry. Various adhesion molecules and their ligands are also overexpressed on the endo thelium or activated T cells, and these molecules facilitate the transmigration of lymphocytes towards the muscle fibers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> Because human myotubes can be stimulated by cytokines to express or secrete immunologically important soluble molecules such as TGF-β, MCP-1, MIP-1α, IL-1β, β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP), cell adhesion molecules, chemokine receptors, MHC and costimulatory molecules, the muscle cells are active modulators rather than passive targets, and they contribute to the persistence or chronicity of the immunopathologic process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Viruses as possible triggering factors</head><p>Although paramyxoviruses and mumps have been indirectly associated with sIBM, molecular techniques have failed to confirm their presence in muscle. The best evidence points towards a connection with retroviruses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> At least seven HIV or human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1-positive patients with sIBM have been reported, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and we have seen six more cases in the past 3 years, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> indicating that the disease might be more common in patients who live longer and harbor this virus for several years. In these patients, the virus does not persist or replicate within the muscle fibers, but is present only in occasional endomysial macrophages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> The disease is triggered by clonally driven subpopulations of activated CD8 + cells that expand in situ and invade muscle fibers expressing MHC class I, as seen in retrovirus-negative poly myositis and sIBM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> These cells are retrovirus-specific, because their CDR3 region contains aminoacid residues that are specific for viral peptide bound to HLA molecules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> The retroviral infection, combined with immune recognition of the retrovirus, is sufficient to trigger the inflammatory process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INFLAMMATION AND DEGENERATION IN INCLUSION BODY MYOSITIS</head><p>Evidence for a degenerative process in sIBM is provided by the presence of vacuoles (almost always in fibers not invaded by T cells) and the intracellular deposition of Congo-red-positive amyloid and β-amyloid-related molecules (e.g. β-APP, phosphorylated tau, presenilin-1, apo lipoprotein E, γ-tubulin, clusterin, α-sy nuclein, gelsolin), and oxidative stress proteins. These accumulations are not unique to sIBM, and they are observed to a similar extent in other vacuolar myopathies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">49</ref> In contrast to the other vacuolar myopathies, however, the vacuolated fibers in sIBM strongly express MHC class I molecules, which have been implicated in inducing ER stress. <ref type="bibr">50</ref> The assembly and folding of MHC class I occurs in the ER. It begins with the association of a heavy chain glycoprotein with β2 microglobulin, forming an unstable heterodimer complex that matures only when it binds to an antigenic peptide (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). 51,52 Antigenic www.nature.com/clinicalpractice/neuro peptides are synthesized in the cytosol by immuno proteasomes, and are transported to the ER by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). The ER maintains quality control by processing, folding and exporting MHC molecules loaded with antigen. If an MHC molecule does not bind to an appropriate antigen, the heavy chain glycoprotein is misfolded and removed from the ER and transported to the cytosol for degradation.</p><p>In sIBM, the muscle fibers are overloaded with MHC molecules, and the antigenic peptides might not undergo proper conformational change to bind to the MHC class I complex, leading to ER stress and further protein misfolding. This model is supported by several observations, including enhanced immuno proteasome activity, 50,53 enhanced MHC class I assembly activity, 54 misfolding of glycoproteins and a cell stress response, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">50</ref> upstream upregulation of αB-crystallin in intact fibers, <ref type="bibr">55</ref> and colocaliza tion of αB-crystallin with MHC molecules (J Schmidt and MC Dalakas, unpublished observations). Such stressor effects are also seen in transgenic mice that overexpress MHC class I, indicating that overexpression of MHC class I alone might be sufficient to induce ER stress. <ref type="bibr">50</ref> Accordingly, the following mechanism for the pathogenesis of sIBM can be proposed. Triggering factors, possibly viruses, could initiate the process leading to clonal expansion of T cells and T-cell-mediated, MHC class I-restricted cytotoxicity via the perforin pathway (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The released cytokines upregulate MHC class I molecules, which cannot exit the ER, resulting in increased levels of the 'MHC-peptide-loading complex' , and an ER-stress response. The ER stress results in accumulation of misfolded amyloid-related glycoproteins and activation of the transcription factor NFκB, both of which promote expression of inflammatory-mediator genes for cytokines and chemokines, thereby further stimulating the MHC/CD8 complex and inducing a self-sustaining inflammatory response. Such crosstalk between inflam matory and degenerative processes is supported by recent observations that in sIBM muscles there is a linear relationship between the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of cytokines and chemokines and that of β-APP, Tau and ubiquitin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr">56</ref> Furthermore, in human myotubes, cytokines enhance the expression of β-APP, tau and ubiquitin mRNAs. <ref type="bibr">56</ref> Additionally, in the muscles of individuals with sIBM, cytokines such as IL-1β, TGF-β and metalloproteinases co-localize with MHC class I and β-amyloid (J Schmidt and MC Dalakas, unpublished observations). Recent observations that autophagic vacuoles and protein aggregates accumulating in perinuclear inclusions, called aggresomes, are sites of viral replication, and that certain viruses induce the formation of aggresomes, 57 provide credence to The heavy chain of MHC class I molecules associates with the chaperone protein cln, binds β2m, and incorporates into a complex containing chaperone proteins such as ERp57, GRP78, GRP94, crt, TAP and tPN, forming the 'MHC class I-peptide loading complex'. Antigenic peptides (derived from degradation of proteins in the cytosol and synthesized by immunoproteasomes that contain two MHC-encoded subunits, LMP2 and LMP7) are transported to the ER by TAP and bind to the MHC class I-peptide loading complex. High-affinity antigenic peptides induce a conformational change in the MHC class I molecules, thereby promoting the release of these molecules from the loading complex. <ref type="bibr">51</ref> In the muscle, the assembled MHC class I-peptide complexes traffic to the cell surface of the muscle fiber, where they are recognized by CD8 + T cells.

Viral triggers lead to clonal expansion of CD8 + T cells and T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity via the perforin pathway.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>sIBM remains a challenging muscle disease in which inflammatory features coexist with degenera tion. Although evidence indicates that there is interplay between the inflammatory mediators associated with T-cell cytotoxicity and the degeneration-associated molecules, it is unclear what triggers the T cells to invade muscle fibers, how the vacuoles are formed, and what role the intracellularly accumulated amyloid-related proteins have. Most remarkably, it remains a mystery why sIBM does not respond to immunotherapies in spite of the primary role of cytotoxic T cells in forming immunological synapses with the muscle fibers, and the strong upregulation of cytokines, chemokines and costimulatory molecules. Further studies are needed to identify the antigens that trigger T-cell activation, the pathogenic role of intra cellularly accumulated proteins, and the molecular events that lead to cell stress, misfolding of glyco proteins and vacuoliza tion. At the clinical level, the natural history of the disease needs to be established with quantitative measurements of muscle strength to assess whether newly applied therapeutic interventions can arrest disease progression. A large longitudinal study that we conducted at the NIH is now near completion. Future therapies should target T-cell signaling, costimulatory or T-cell transmigration molecules, and the factors that are responsible for the ER stress and accumula tion of amyloid-related proteins. </p></div>

It is hypothesized that the disease begins when viruses break tolerance, and CD8 + T cells, on receiving putative antigens by macrophages that serve as antigen-presenting cells, become activated. The released cytokines upregulate VCAM1 and ICAM1, thereby allowing the transgression of T cells through the endothelial cell wall to reach the muscle fiber. The released cytokines upregulate MHC class I, chemokine receptors, costimulatory molecules and ICAM1 on the muscle fibers, allowing the invading T cells to scan for antigens and initiate the formation of immunological synapses between MHC class I and the T-cell receptors. The engagement of the costimulatory molecules BB1, ICOS and CD40 on the muscle fibers with their ligands CD28, CTLA4, ICOSL and CD40L on the autoinvasive T cells completes the synapse and activates the T cells. Muscle fiber necrosis occurs via perforin granules released by the autoinvasive cytotoxic T cells. The muscle fibers are also active modulators because they secrete cytokines and chemokines, which further activate the invading CD8 + T cells thereby contributing to the persistence and chronicity of the immunopathologic process.
