			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To investigate the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathies and the amyloid formation in sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM). Background: MMPs comprise a family of calcium-dependent zinc endoproteinases induced by cytokines and secreted by inflammatory cells. They enhance T-cell migration or adhesion and degrade components of the extracellular matrix proteins. Some MMPs also have been implicated in the formation of ␤-amyloid. Methods: We examined the expression of MMPs with single and double immunocytochemistry using antibodies against MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-9, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, CD8 ϩ cells, macrophage, and ␤-amyloid precursor protein (␤-APP) on serial muscle biopsy sections from patients with s-IBM, polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), and disease control specimens. The enzyme activity of MMPs was measured by gelatin substrate zymography. Results: Only the gelatinases, MMP-9 and MMP-2, were expressed in the muscle. In s-IBM and PM, but not the control specimens, MMP-9 and MMP-2 immunostained the non-necrotic and MHC class-I-expressing muscle fibers, and MMP-9, but not MMP-2, immunostained the autoinvasive CD8 ϩ cytotoxic T cells. Zymography in muscle homogenates confirmed the increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzymatic activity. MMP-2, but not MMP-9, immunostained the rimmed vacuoles in s-IBM and colocalized with ␤-APP, suggesting a possible involvement with the amyloid deposits. Conclusions: Because collagen IV is prominent on the muscle membrane, the overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9 on the non-necrotic muscle fibers in polymyositis (PM) and sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) may facilitate lymphocyte adhesion and enhance T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity by degrading extracellular matrix proteins. The findings may have practical implications in considering therapeutic trials with MMP inhibitors in patients with PM and s-IBM.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods.</head><p>Frozen sections of muscle biopsy specimens from well-characterized patients with inflammatory myopathies, including seven patients with s-IBM, three with PM, and three with DM, were studied. Control specimens from three patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), two with ALS, and two normal subjects were concurrently examined. The tissues were processed for single and double immunocytochemistry and gelatin zymography as follows:</p><p>Single immunocytochemistry. Five-micrometer serial sections were fixed in acetone at 4 °C for 10 minutes, rinsed in 0.05 mol/L Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) for 15 minutes, and incubated for 30 minutes with a blocking solution containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum or 5% horse serum, as described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with one of the following antibodies: (1) mouse monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) against human MMP-3 (dilution 1:400; Chemicon, Temecula, CA); (2) mouse monoclonal IgG against human MMP-7 (dilution 1:50; R &amp; D System, Minneapolis, MN); (3) rabbit polyclonal IgG against human MMP-2 (dilution 1:400; Chemicon, Temecula, CA); and (4) goat polyclonal IgG against human MMP-9 (dilution 1:50; Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA). These affinity-purified antibodies are well-characterized and do not cross-react with each other. After being washed for 30 minutes in Trisbuffered saline, the sections were incubated with biotinylated goat antimouse IgG (for MMP-3 and MMP-7), biotinylated goat antirabbit IgG (for MMP-2), or biotinylated horse antigoat IgG (for MMP-9) followed by fluorescent isothiocyanate (FITC) avidin D.</p><p>Double immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging. Double immunofluorescence was performed to examine whether MMP-9 and MMP-2 are present on the CD8 ϩ cytotoxic T cells, macrophages, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I-expressing muscle fibers, or on the ␤-APP-positive amyloid deposits. For double staining, frozen sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the polyclonal antibodies against MMP-9 or MMP-2, followed by biotinylated secondary antibodies and fluoresceinconjugated avidin (green), as described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> In brief, after rinsing and blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal goat serum, or 5% horse serum, the same sections were incubated with one of the following mouse IgG monoclonal antibodies against: (1) ␤-APP (dilution 1:10; Zymed, South San Francisco, CA), (2) CD8 (dilution 1:100; Couter, Miami, FL), ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) macrophage (Ber-Mac3, dilution 1:100; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), or (4) MHC class I (dilution 1:100; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) followed by TRITC (trimethylrhodamine isothiocyanate)-conjugated secondary antibody against mouse IgG (red). The slides were mounted and examined with a Zeiss photomicroscope equipped with epifluoscence optics. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used for more accurate colocalization of the antigens expressed on the surface of cells or muscle fibers. To avoid cross-reactivity, despite blocking, we reconfirmed the results in serial sections stained separately for each of the primary antibodies.</p><p>Gelatin zymography. Ten percent polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), impregnated with 1 g/mL gelatin (Novex, San Deigo, CA), were used to detect gelatinolytic MMPs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Five 10-m-thick sections of muscle tissue were weighted, homogenized, and mixed with sample buffer (63 mmol Tris-HCL, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.0025% bromophenol blue) under nonreducing conditions. Protein concentration was determined with a modified Bradford dye-binding procedure (Bio-Rad protein assay; Bio-Rad, Herts, UK). SDS protein electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C to prevent gelatin degradation loading an equal amount of protein in each gel. The gels were washed with zymogram-renaturing buffer (Novex) containing Triton X-100 to remove the SDS, followed by incubation in a zymogram-developing buffer (Novex) for 24 to 72 hours at 37 °C. Subsequently, the gels were stained for 6 hours in 30% methanol: 10% acetic acid containing 0.1% (wt/vol) Coomassie blue R250 and destained in the same buffer without dye. Gelatinase activity was detected as an unstained band on blue background representing areas of gelatin digestion.

The antibodies against MMP-3 and MMP-7 did not stain inflammatory cells or muscle fibers in any of the studied specimens. In contrast, the antibodies against MMP-9 and MMP-2 immunostained muscle fibers and inflammatory cells in the diseased, but not the normal, muscles as follows:</p><p>In s-IBM and PM, but not DM, DMD or the other disease controls, MMP-9 and MMP-2, was found expressed on the muscle membrane of the healthy, non-necrotic, and MHC class-I-expressing muscle fibers surrounded or invaded by the CD8 ϩ cytotoxic T cells (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The non-necrotic nature of these fibers was shown in a serial section stained with hematoxylin-eosin, as shown in the inset (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The membrane of some healthy, MHC class-Iexpressing muscle fibers remote from the areas of inflammation was also weakly positive for MMP-9 or MMP-2, as shown with confocal microscopy (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Most of the autoinvasive CD8 ϩ T cells were positive for MMP-9 but not MMP-2 (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Although quantitative assessment was not performed, it appears that most of the CD8 ϩ cells were MMP-9-positive. Some of the macrophages were also MMP-9-positive (data not shown). The membrane of the MHC class-I-positive, healthy muscle fibers, invaded or not by CD8 ϩ T cells, was MMP-2-and MMP-9-positive only in PM and s-IBM but not in DM and DMD, probably because of the relative absence of such fibers in the latter condi-</p></div>

In contrast, in all the specimens, including DMD and DM, the membrane and the cytoplasm of the regenerating muscle fibers and the endothelial cells of the blood vessel walls immunostained strongly with antibodies against MMP-2 and MMP-9 (not shown).

A unique finding in s-IBM was the immunostaining of several rimmed vacuolated fibers with antibodies against MMP-2 but not MMP-9 (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>).

With zymography, two major bands of varying gelatinolytic activity, a 92-kd band corresponding to MMP-9 and a 72-kd band corresponding to MMP-2, were detected in all muscle biopsy specimens, including s-IBM, PM, DM, and DMD (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4A</ref>). A weaker band was also noted in the normal and ALS muscle, probably because of the presence of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in the blood vessels (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4A</ref>). Semiquantification of the gelatinolytic activity showed that MMP-2 and MMP-9 were increased in the inflammatory myopathies and DMD compared to ALS and control specimens (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4B</ref>). In DMD, the high activity most likely corresponds to enhanced expression of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in the regenerating muscle fibers. A minor 62-kd band of MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity, attributed to an activated form of 72-kd gelatinase, was observed in all the myopathic conditions but not the ALS or control specimens (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4A</ref>).</p><p>Discussion.

However, unique to PM and s-IBM, but not the disease control specimens, was the upregulation of MMP-9 and MMP-2 on the muscle membrane of the healthy, MHC class-I-expressing muscle fibers invaded by CD8 ϩ T cells and the colocalization of MMPs with MHC class-I antigen. The findings suggest that in PM and s-IBM, the MMP-9 and MMP-2 may play a role in promoting the adhesion of autoinvasive T cells to the muscle, as proposed for other autoimmune diseases such as MS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> Guillain-Barre syndrome, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and rheumatoid arthritis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> The gelatinase MMP-2 secreted by a range of cells and the gelatinase MMP-9 secreted mainly by inflammatory cells have the ability to degrade many extracellular matrix components, including proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminin, glycoprotein, and various types of collagen, especially type-IV collagen. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> The skeletal muscle fibers are surrounded by a basement membrane (basal lamina) that contains predominantly type-IV collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and heparin sulfate proteoglycan. Because the substrate specificities of MMP-9 and MMP-2 are similar to the natural components of the basal lamina, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> the noted upregulation of MMPs in the muscle membrane of patients with PM and s-IBM may play an active role in disrupting of the integrity of the muscle fibers by the autoinvasive cytotoxic T cells. The presence of MMP-9 on some CD8 ϩ T cells is consistent with the observation that MMP-9 is produced by activated T cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Cytokines, including tumor necrotic factor-␣ (TNF-␣), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and transforming growth factor-␤ (TGF-␤), <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> which are variably increased in PM and s-IBM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> are also known inducers of MMP production and may serve as an additional source for upregulating MMP and facilitating T-cellmediated myocytotoxicity.</p><p>Another finding in the current study was the colocalization of MMP-2, but not MMP-9, with the ␤-APP-positive areas within the vacuoles of s-IBM. MMP-2 can cleave the full-length ␤-APP and may have an amyloidogenic effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> Conversely, amyloid peptides can induce in vitro the expression of MMPs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> Of interest, in the brains of patients with AD, there is elevation of MMP-2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> The inflammatory and amyloidogenic potential of MMP-2 may be analogous to IL-1␤, which is also expressed in the vacuoles of s-IBM and the amyloid plaques of AD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> It can be proposed that in s-IBM, the chronic inflammation may induce the production of both cytokines and MMPs, which have the potential to enhance amyloid formation. In turn, the formed amyloid may contribute to the chronicity of inflammation and cytotoxicity by enhancing the production of MMPs, as proposed for IL-1␤ in s-IBM and AD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> The upregulation of the gelatinases (MMP-9 and MMP-2) in inflammatory myopathies may offer the opportunity for therapeutic interventions.
