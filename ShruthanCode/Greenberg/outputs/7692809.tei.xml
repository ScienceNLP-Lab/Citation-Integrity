<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) and hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hIBM) are severe and progressive muscle diseases, characterized pathologically by vacuolated muscle fibers that contain 15-to 21-nm cytoplasmic tubulofilaments (CTFs). Those vacuolated muscle fibers also contain abnormally accumulated ubiquitin and P-amyloid protein (AP), and they contain amyloid in 0-pleated sheets as indicated by Congo red and crystal violet positivity. Using several well-characterized antibodies, we have now demonstrated that, in addition to AP, two other epitopes, N-terminal and C-terminal, of the P-amyloid precursor protein (PPP) are abnormally accumulated in IBM vacuolated muscle fibers and similarly in hlBM. At the light microscopy level, immunoreactivities of N-and C-epitopes of PPP closely colocalized with AP and ubiquitin immunoreactivities. However, by immunogold electronmicroscopy, even though N-, C-, and AQ epitopes of PPP and ubiquitin colocalized at the amorphous and dense floccular structures, only AP was localized to the 6to 10-nm amyloid-like fibrils and only ubiquitin was localized to CTFs. PPP immunoreactive structures were often in proximity to CTFs, but CTFs themselves never contained PPP immunoreactivities.</p><p>The fact that AP but not C-or N-terminal epitopes of PPP localized to the 6to 10-nm amyloid-like fibrils suggests that free AP might be generated during PPP processing and, after aggregation, may be responsible for the amyloid present within IBM muscle fibers. Our study demonstrates that three epitopes of PPP accumulate abnormally in diseased human muscle, and therefore this phenomenon is not unique to Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome brain, and Dutch-type cerebrovascular amyloidosis.</p></div>

By routine histochemistry, IBM can be difficult to distinguish from polymyositis. Electronmiuoscopy (EM) reveals that abnormal muscle fibers contain cytoplasmic tubdofilaments (CTFs), <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref>-to 21-nm external and 3to 6-nm internal diameter; these have been considered the characteristic ultrastructural feature of IBM {l-51.

The pathogenesis of these hereditary disorders is unknown.</p><p>Vacuolated muscle fibers of both sporadic and hereditary IBM have recently been shown to contain <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> abnormal accumulations of ubiquitin (Ub) and Pamyloid protein (AP) <ref type="bibr">[13-161, and</ref> (2) Congo red positivity indicative of amyloid in P-pleated sheets [171.</p><p>By light microscopy, Ub and AP colocalized with each other; however, by immuno-EM Ub was localized to CTFs 113, 141, while AP was localized to amorphous, poorly defined structures and to 6to IO-nm amyloid-like fibrils { 161. Abnormally accumulated alantichymotrypsin immunoreactivity was also demonstrated in the vacuolated muscle fibers of sporadic and hereditary IBM by light microscopy 1181. There is a pathological similarity between abnormal muscle fiber intracellular inclusions of IBM and the extracellular senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain because both contain accumulations of amyloid fibrils, Ub, AP, and a,-antichymotrypsin ({13-211, reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr">231)</ref>.</p><p>of the much larger P-amyloid precursor protein (PPP) 124-261. Abnormal accumulation of AP in AD brain is thought to result from abnormal proteolytic cleavage of PPP, which produces the amyloidogenic fragment AP (reviewed in 127, 28)). In the dystrophic neurites of senile plaques of AD brain, in addition to AP there are abnormally accumulated C-terminal and Nterminal sequences of . In respect to sporadic and hereditary IBM, we now have asked whether other epitopes of PPP, in addition to A@, are abnormally accumulated in IBM and, if so, how they relate ultrastructurally to AP and Ub immunoreacrivities. Using both light and EM immunocytochemistry, we localized three sequences of PPP, viz, the N-terminal 45-62, C-terminal 676-695, and AP sequence, and coloched them with each other and with Ub.</p></div>

For fluorescence staining, the procedure was essentially the same as for PAP except that the secondary antibodies were labeled either with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or rhodamine. In some instances, the secondary antiserum was biotinylated and the reaction product was visualized by streptavidin-Texas red. Double immunolocalization of PPP epitopes with each other and with Ub was performed with double fluorescence labeling using FITC, Texas red, or rhodamine as described 116, 43, 443.</p></div>

The embedded section in the dish was viewed under phase-contrast microscopy and compared with an adjacent cross section that had been incubated with the same antibody as for EM but stained with the PAP reaction. The exact same muscle fibers that contained PAP-positive inclusions were identified in the adjacent gold-labeled Epon-embedded section, marked, and l-mm- diameter cores drilled out E45, 461.

In the hereditary IBM biopsy, some muscle fibers contained a strong, wide subsarco-lemma1 accumulation of PPP sequences that extended to the interior of the fiber (Fig 3  When the primary antibody was omitted, absorbed, or replaced by a nonimmune serum, the immunoreaction did not take place.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study demonstrated that N-, C-, and AP epitopes of PPP were abnormally accumulated in the vacuolated muscle fibers of sporadic and hereditary IBM. Most of those accumulations were Congo red and crystal violet positive, indicating amyloid in p-pleated sheets. However, some vacuolated fibers in sporadic IBM and all the vacuolated fibers in our 1 patient with hereditary IBM had three-epitope PPP positive accumulations that were Congo red negative, suggesting that their AP sequences were not in an amyloid P-pleated sheet configuration, but perhaps still in relatively intact PPP molecules. Accordingly, such accumulations may represent early changes of this IBM feature. The Congo red negativity of these A@-containing loci is like that of diffuse plaques in A D brain, which are considered to be an early abnormality {40, 501. The presence of PPP accumulations deeply internal within some muscle fibers suggests their origin was intracellular.</p><p>Even though immunoreactivities of PPP epicopes colocalized with each other and with Ub at the light microscopic level, their ultrastructural localization differed. While all three PPP epitopes were colocalized to several types of abnormal subcellular structures, only AP was locahzed to the 6to 10-nm-diameter amyloid-like fibrils. None of the PPP epitopes was localized on the 15-to 21-nm-diameter CTFs; these contained only strong Ub immunoreactivity.</p><p>In some very abnormal muscle fibers, the accumulations of PPP appeared to extend outside the muscle fiber boundary. This may have been due to a fragility of the fiber's surface membrane, which could have been transiently broken. Sometimes associated with those fibers were a few PPP structures intermingled with collagen fibrils, either inside the muscle fiber or outside but very close to it. Because collagen fibrils are an extracellular component, the occasional PPP structures intermixed with them just outside the fiber may have been generated (1) inside the muscle fiber but emerged through a broken membrane or by exocytosis, or <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> outside the fiber. The first possibility appears more likely because (1) it has been reported that PPP is synthesized in the normal adult muscle fiber {Sl}, (2) PPP is present within normal human muscle fibers at the postsynaptic domain of the neuromuscular junction 1437, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">( 3 )</ref>  Prior to our studies of 1BM muscle, abnormal accumulation of PPP epitopes was reported only in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> brain senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome, and (2) cerebral blood vessels of Alzheimer's disease and Dutch-type hereditary cerebral hemorrhage (reviewed in 122, 27, 281). Our results demonstrate that all three epitopes of PPP (N-terminal, C-terminal, and AP) are abnormally accumulated in vacuolated muscle fibers of sporadic and hereditary IBM. Further studies will be required to answer several questions. Does this accumulation result from increased generation of PPP, abnormal processing of it, or both? Is PPP abnormality the initial step in a cascade of pathogenic events leading to sporadic and hereditary IBM, including formation of CTFs, or is it secondary to another pathogenic mechanism? Is the Ub increase a primary pathogenic process or is it secondary to a need for Ub to facilitate degradation of abnormal proteins? Do similar abnormal PPP accumulations occur in any other muscle disease that we have not yet studied?</p><p>The fact that AP, but not C-and N-terminal epitopes of PPP, is localized to the amyloid-like fibrils suggests that free AP is generated during PPP processing and may be responsible for the amyloid present in IBM muscle fibers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our study indicates that abnormal accumulation of PPP occurs in diseased human muscle and thus is not unique to the brain and cerebral vessels. Normal and pathological human muscle, including use of cultured normal and genetically abnormal (such as hereditary IBM) muscle [SS}, should provide living human tissue more readily accessible than brain for a wide range of molecular studies of PPP synthesis and processing. Such analyses could lead to a better understanding of sporadic and hereditary IBM, Alzheimer's disease, and perhaps other diseases. Whether there is a mutation of the PPP gene in hereditary IBM remains to be determined. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig I .</head><label>.</label><figDesc>Fig I .

PPP, the product of a chromosome-21 gene [52], exists in virtually all tissues (reviewed in {22)). PPP is considered to be a cell-surface glycoprotein containing a large extracellular N-terminal domain, a transmembrane AP domain, and a short cytoplasmic C-terminal domain 124-261. The PPP gene produces at least three alternatively spliced transcripts, encoding PPP containing 695, 751, or 770 amino acids. The last two contain in their extracellular region an insert of a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (reviewed in {22, 28)). The biological functions of PPP are unknown, but it may play a role in (1) cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interaction [52-561, (2) neurite growth 1531, and (3) maintaining cell integrity and shape 1571. The recent demonstration that PPP epitopes are strongly accumulated postsynaptically at normal human neuromuscular junc-tions 1431 suggests that PPP may have an important function there.</figDesc></figure>
