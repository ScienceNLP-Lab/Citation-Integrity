<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is defined clinically by a characteristic pattern of progressive proximal and distal limb muscle weakness and resistance to steroid therapy, and histologically by the presence of distinctive rimmed vacuoles and filamentous inclusions as well as a mononuclear infiltrate in which CD8 + T cells are predominant. Muscle damage is believed to be mediated by autoimmune mechanisms, but very little information is available on the immunogenic features of IBM. MHC class I and DR antigens were typed on 13 caucasoid patients with IBM using standard serological techniques or by allele-specific oligonucleotide typing. Complement components C4 and properdin factor B (Bf) were typed by immunofixation after electrophoresis. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) in the class III region were analysed using cDNA probes for C4 and 21-hydroxylase (CYP21) after Taq 1 digestion. IBM was associated with DR3 (92%), DR52 (100%) and HLA B8 (75%). The phenotype data were examined for likely haplotypes by considering together the alleles at the class I, DR and complement loci along with the C4 and CYP21 RFLP. Ten of the DR3 + subjects had a 6 4-kb C4-hybridizing fragment characteristic of a deletion of C4A and CYP21-A. These patients probably carried all, or at least the class II and III regions, of the extended haplotype marked by B8/C4A*QO/C4Bl/BfS/DR3/DR52, which has been associated with several autoimmune diseases and is present in 11 % of the healthy caucasoid population. Of the remaining subjects, two had evidence of the extended haplotype marked by B18/C4A3/C4BQ*0/BfFl/DR3, which is present in less than 5% of the healthy population and has been associated with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. These data provide support for an autoimmune etiology for, and genetic predisposition to, IBM.   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is now recognized as a separate form of chronic inflammatory myopathy with distinctive clinical and pathological features [1 -3]. It can be distinguished clinically from polymyositis and dermatomyositis by the characteristic distribution of affected muscles, the absence of skin involvement (cf. dermatomyositis) and its relative resistance to corticosteroid, and other immunosuppressive, therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Histopathological criteria include the demonstration of characteristic rimmed vacuoles, which show immunohistochemical evidence of ubiquitin or beta amyloid and, at the electron-microscopic level, the presence ofmicrotubular filaments within cytoplasmic or nuclear inclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The inflammatory infiltrates characteristically contain a high proportion of CD8 + T cells, which are often closely associated with non-necrotic muscle fibres <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Electron- microscopic examination often reveals invasion of non-necrotic muscle fibres by the lymphocyte processes [4]. Thus, CD8 + T cell-mediated cytotoxicity is believed to be the primary immu- nopathological mechanism; a possibility supported by the sarcolemmal expression of class I MHC antigens in the vicinity of invading T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. The disease is believed to be auto- immune in nature, although the target antigen is unknown.</p><p>In most diseases in which an autoimmune mechanism is suspected there is evidence that immunogenetic factors such as those encoded within the MHC are involved in the predisposition to the development of disease. The products of the genes in this region play a fundamental role in the immune response. Class I and class II antigens are directly responsible for antigen presentation, others form part of the complement cascade (e.g. C4 and properdin factor B (Bf)), and others code for cytokines which are crucial in regulating and mediating immune responses (e.g. tumour necrosis factors (TNF)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In both polymyositis and dermatomyositis associations with HLA DR3 and HLA B8 have been described in caucasoids, although these associations have generally been relatively weak (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). When only patients with polymyositis and antibodies to histidyl-tRNA synthetase (Jo-1) are considered, however, this association is stronger <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Very little information has been published with regard to the immunogenetics of IBM.</p><p>In this study we describe a detailed analysis of the MHC of a group of caucasoid patients with IBM, and demonstrate a significant association with the extended haplotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> marked by HLA B8, C4A*QO and DR3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PATIENTS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p>All 13 patients (nine males, four females) were caucasoid and were derived from the neuromuscular clinic at Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, Western Australia. Their ages ranged from 42 to 87 years (six in their sixties, three in their seventies, two in their eighties and two in their forties). All patients had the characteristic pattern of muscle involvement seen in IBM, with particularly severe involvement of the quadriceps femoris muscles in the lower limbs and of the forearm flexor muscles in the upper limbs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Only one patient (patient 3) had shown any response to corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy. The diagnosis of an inflammatory myopathy was confirmed by muscle biopsy in all but one patient (patient 1 1). In all the other 12 patients the presence of typical inclusion bodies and rimmed vacuoles was confirmed by light or electron- microscopy. Antibodies to Jo-1 were assessed in the Department of Clinical Immunology, Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, using a standard immunodiffusion assay. None of the 11 patients on whom sera were available were Jo-i HLA typing Class I HLA typing and serological DR typing were performed in the Department of Clinical Immunology, Royal Perth Hospital, by standard microcytotoxicity techniques using defined antisera obtained from local and international histocompatibility workshops. Allele-specific oligonucleotide typing for DRB1, DRB3 and DRB4 genes was performed on genomic DNA in the tissue typing laboratory, Royal Melbourne Hos- pital, or at the ARC Epidemiology Research Unit, Manchester, UK, using primers and techniques described in the 11th International Histocompatibility Workshop [11].</p><p>Complement typing Alleles of C4 and Bf were defined after separation by gel electrophoresis and immunofixation with specific antisera <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Null alleles were assigned after densitometry, as prevously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Southern analysis DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes using a standard phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol technique [13]. Ten micrograms of DNA were digested with Taq 1, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Digested DNA was electrophoresed through 0-6% agarose gels and transferred to Genescreen Plus membrane (Dupont, Boston, MA) using standard Southern blotting procedures.</p><p>The C4 cDNA probe was a BamH I -Kpn I fragment derived from the 5' end of the clone pAT-A <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The probe for the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21) was pC21/3c <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Hybridiza- tion and washing were as described previously [16]. Washed blots were exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham, Aylesbury, UK) at -70'C for 1-7 days. Exposed blots were stripped with 0-4N sodium hydroxide before reprobing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>HLA typing Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> lists the MHC class I, class II and complement alleles which were detected in each patient, and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> provides a summary of the frequencies of selected alleles. Significant increases in the frequencies of DR3 (P &lt; 0 005), B8 (P &lt; 0-01) and C4A*QO (P &lt; 0005) were observed in the patient group as demonstrated by x2 analysis. Control frequencies for DR were recently derived from the Western Australian caucasoid population (Department of Clinical Immunology, Royal Perth Hospital) and those for B8 and C4 null alleles have been published previously [17,18].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Complement allotyping</head><p>Of the 10 patients on whom C4 allotyping was performed, densitometry suggested that six had a C4A*Q0 allele and one a C4B*QO (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). C4 null alleles could not be assigned in the remainder. All patients tested were positive for BfS, and in two of those tested BfFI was detected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class III RFLP</head><p>When genomic DNA is digested with Taq 1 and probed with a C4 cDNA probe which can hybridize to the 5' end of the gene, at least four polymorphic fragments may be resolved <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>: (i) a 70- kb fragment which most often represents a C4A gene; (ii) a 6-4- kb fragment which is virtually always found on the extended haplotype marked by B8/DR3, and probably represents a hybrid C4A/C4B gene which is a marker for a deletion encompassing C4A and CYP21-A <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>; (iii) a 6-0-kb fragment which most often *Control frequencies for DR alleles derived from a panel of 40 healthy caucasoid individuals compiled in the Department of Clinical Immunology, Royal Perth Hospital, Western Australia (unpublished data).

Control fre- quencies have been previously published [18]. encodes a C4B allele; (iv) a 5-4-kb fragment which virtually always encodes a C4B allele. Taq 1 digestion and hybridization with a CYP21-specific probe can produce two major fragments. The 3 7-kb fragment represents CYP21-B, the active form of 21- hydroxylase, and the 3 2-kb fragment represents CYP21-A, which is a non-functional pseudogene [15,20].</p><p>Of the 12 patients whose DNA was subjected to this analysis, 10 had the 6-4-kb C4-hybridizing fragment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), suggesting the presence of a C4A*QO allele. CYP21 analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) showed that in six patients (patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and I 1) the ratio of 3 7-3 2 kb fragments was approximately 2, indicat- ing a deletion of the 32kb fragment (CYP-21A) on one haplotype. It is likely that in each patient this deletion was present on the haplotype marked by the 6-4-kb C4 hybridizing fragment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. In two patients (patients 5 and 8) there was no 3 2-kb fragment (lanes 8 and 11, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>), indicating the absence of CYP21-A from both chromosomes. Patient 5 had no C4 bands characteristic of C4B, and the bands at 7-0 kb and 6-4 kb were of equal intensity, suggesting that the composite C4A/B hybrid gene (6-4 kb) was present on one chromosome and that the second chromosome carried a deletion of C4B and CYP21-A. This patient was probably DR3 homozygous, since repeated allele-specific oligonucleotide DR typing failed to detect a second DRB1 gene. It is likely that B8, C4A*QO, C4B1, BfS and DR3 were all present on the one haplotype. The BfF1 carried by this patient was likely to be on the second haplotype, which probably also carried a deletion of C4B and CYP-21A. Thus the class II and III regions of this haplotype were characteristic of the extended haplotype usually marked by B18/C4A3/C4B*QO/ BfFl/DR3 [16]. Patient 8 had exactly the same C4 and CYP21 fragments as patient 5, and probably also carried the B8/C4A*QO/DR3 haplotype. In this case the deletion of C4B and CYP21-A was probably carried on a haplotype marked by Al 1/B35/C4A3/DRI (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) [10].</p><p>In patient 7 the intensities of the two CYP21 bands were similar (lane 2, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>), and four complement bands of equal intensity were present (lane 2, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). It seems likely that one chromosome carried a deletion of C4A (evidenced by the 6 4-kb fragment), and probably CYP21-A, while the other chromo- some had a duplication of the C4 gene, and presumably the CYP21-A gene (i.e. three copies of C4 and three of CYP-21). The order is (1) patient 2, (2) patient 7, (3) patient 12, (4) patient 3, (5) patient 1, (6) patient 6, (7) patient 4, (8) patient 5, (9) patient 9, (10) patient 11, (11) patient 8. DNA from patient 13 was run on a separate blot and had C4 hybridizing fragments at 7 0, 6-4 and 6 0 kb (data not shown). No DNA was available on patient 10. -n Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Probable class III gene arrangements in the patients with inclusion body myositis (IBM) derived from the analysis of C4 and CYP21 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), complement typing, and previous knowledge of extended haplotypes and C4 and CYP21 combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. The genes are labelled according to the size of the corresponding Taq 1 RFLP. DNA was unavailable from patient 10, and in patient 13 RFLP data for C4 but not CYP21 was obtained. Therefore probable rearrangements for these subjects are not shown.</p><p>Two patients did not show evidence of the 6-4-kb C4 fragment. Patient 9 had C4-hybridizing bands of equal inten- sity at 7 0kb and 5-4 kb (lane 9, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), but the ratio of the 3.7-kb to 3-2-kb CYP21 bands approximated 3, suggesting a deletion of CYP21-A on one chromosome and duplication of CYP21-B on the other. This is consistent with the possibility that the DR3-bearing haplotype in this patient carried a deletion of C4B and CYP21-A and the other haplotype carried a duplication of C4B and CYP21-B <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. A likely arrangement of these genes on each chromosome is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. By contrast, in patient 12 the 3-2-kb fragment hybridized more strongly than the 3 7-kb fragment (lane 3, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>), and the relative intensities of the C4 fragments suggested a ratio of 2:2:1 for the fragments at 7 0kb, 6 0kb and 5-4kb, respectively (lane 3, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), i.e. the presence of five C4 genes: three on one chromosome (with two copies of CYP21-A and one of CYP21 -B) and two on the other (with one copy each of CYP2 1-A and CYP21-B). Other combinations are however possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. The interpretation of the class III region restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) data is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, in which the RFLP fragments at each of the C4 and CYP21 loci are represented as distinct blocks. Absence of a block indicates a deletion. The arrangements of the class III regions on both chromosomes are shown for each patient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extended haplotypes</head><p>When the class I and II HLA typing are considered together with the class III RFLP data and previous published data <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, it is possible to make predictions as to the likely presence of certain extended haplotypes. All 10 patients with the 6-4-kb C4 fragment had DR3, and of these eight had HLA- B8. When taken together with the CYP21 data, this suggests that all 10 carried the extended haplotype marked by B8/ C4A*QO/DR3, or at least the class II and III regions of it. Of these 10 patients, in at least four there was evidence of deletion or duplication among the class III genes on the second chromosome. Patients 5, 7 and 8 have been discussed above. In patient 2 the detection of two C4A alleles (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) in the presence of the B8/C4A*QO/DR3 haplotype suggests the possibility of a duplication at the C4A locus on the second chromosome. A C4A: C4B densitometric ratio of greater than 1 (data not shown) also suggests that the haplotype contains a duplication at C4A and a deletion at C4B. An extended haplotype consisting of A3/B35/C4A3, C4A2/BfF/DR1 (all present in patient 2-see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) containing a null allele at C4B has been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p><p>Of the remaining patients, patient 10 probably had the extended haplotype B18/C4A3/C4B*Q0/BfFI/DR3 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), while patient 9 probably had a C4B/CYP21-A deletion charac- teristic of this haplotype on one chromosome and a duplication of these loci on the other. Patient 12 probably had one haplotype with a C4/CYP21 duplication. Thus of the 26 haplotypes present in these 13 patients, 18 had evidence of either deletion or duplication in the class III region. Of these, 14 at least can be assigned to recognized extended haplotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>These data provide the first detailed analysis of the MHC in a group of patients with IBM. The demonstration that DR3 is so strongly associated with IBM confirms and extends previous reports that DR3 was moderately increased in frequency in IBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Further, we have provided strong evidence that the DR3 in these patients most frequently occurs on haplotypes marked by C4A*QO which contain all or part of the extended haplotype characterized by B8/C4A*QO/C4B1/BfS/DR3/ DR52. Interestingly, in two of the patients who did not have the B8/DR3 extended haplotype, the DR3 was probably present on haplotypes marked by B18/C4A3/C4B*QO/BfFl/ DR3, which has been strongly associated with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Although the patient numbers in this study are small, the frequencies of DR3 and B8 reported here are greater than those reported previously for polymyositis and dermatomyositis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> and for well recog- nized DR3-associated diseases such as IDDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, myasthenia gravis [24] and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [25]. The most significant HLA association previously described in inflammatory muscle disease is that between DR3 and DR52, and the presence of both interstitial lung disease and antibodies to Jo-l in myositis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. None of the patients tested in this study had antibodies to Jo-i, and pulmonary involvement was not a clinical feature.</p><p>The strong linkage disequilibrium between the class II and III regions, and particularly between genes in the DR/DQ region <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, makes it difficult to define the locus which is primarily involved in determining disease susceptibility. The high fre- quency of C4 null alleles (at least 10 C4A*QO plus at least two C4B*QO) might suggest a role for partial C4 deficiency in this disease, as has been suggested for SLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. However, as has been discussed previously [27], dissecting the effects of the C4 null alleles on disease susceptibility from those ofgenes at other loci is extremely difficult. There is evidence for deletions or duplications in the class III region on at least 18 of the 26 haplotypes in this patient group, so that it is tempting to speculate, as has been done in other diseases [28], that a gene, or genes, in this region may play a role in determining disease susceptibility.</p><p>On the other hand, the presence of DR3 in all but one patient supports a direct role for a class II gene product. Histological data suggest that IBM is mediated primarily by CD8 + T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Thus if DR3 itself, or a class II locus allele in strong linkage disequilibrium with DRB1*0301 [26], is responsible for confer- ring disease susceptibility, then it probably acts at the level of the CD4' helper cells, presumably during initiation of disease.</p><p>Analysis of anti-muscle responses of T cell clones or lines derived from these patients may help determine the relative importance of DR3 versus linked class II genes or alleles on the second haplotype in defining anti-muscle activity. Certain other immunological abnormalities, such as aberrant TNF production <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, have, however, been associated with the B8/ DR3 extended haplotype. It remains a possibility that the interaction of alleles at more than one locus on this extended haplotype confers susceptibility to the development of autoim- munity. The nature of the precipitating agent and other host immunogenic factors may in turn determine which target antigen and which tissue (e.g. muscle versus pancreas) is affected.</p><p>In conclusion, we have described a highly significant association between IBM and DR3. The DR3 most fre- quently, but not invariably, formed part of the extended MHC haplotype marked by B8/C4A*QO/C4BI/BfS/DR3, which is known to be associated with various forms of auto- immune diseases, including other forms of myositis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
