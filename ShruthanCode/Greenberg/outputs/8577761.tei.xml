<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As in Alzheimer-disease (AD) brain, vacuo- lated muscle fibers of inclusion-body myositis (IBM) contain abnormally accumulated g-amyloid precursor protein (f3APP), including its 8-amyloid protein epitope, and in- creased jAPP-751 mRNA. Other similarities between IBM muscle and AD brain phenotypes include paired helical fila- ments, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, apolipoprotein E, and mitochondrial abnormalities, including decreased cyto- chrome-c oxidase (COX) activity. The pathogenesis of these abnormalities in IBM muscle and AD brain is not known. We now report that direct transfer of the f3APP gene, using adenovirus vector, into cultured normal human muscle fibers causes structural abnormalities of mitochondria and de- creased COX activity. In this adenovirus-mediated 3APP gene transfer, we demonstrated that j8APP overproduction can induce mitochondrial abnormalities. The data suggest that excessive IAPP may be responsible for mitochondrial and COX abnormalities in IBM muscle and perhaps AD brain.</p><p>3-Amyloid precursor protein (,3APP), whose gene is on chro- mosome 21, is a cell surface glycoprotein containing a large extracellular N-terminal domain, a transmembrane /3-amyloid protein (A,B) domain, and a short cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (1). The ,BAPP gene produces several alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different ,BAPP isoforms. The two largest isoforms, ,BAPP-751 and /3APP-770, contain in their extracellular region an insert of a Kunitz-type protease- inhibitor (KPI) (1).</p><p>,BAPP is considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) (1-3). The f3APP epitope AP3, a 39-to 43-residue polypeptide, is the major component of amyloid fibrils in blood vessels and senile plaques of AD brain. In AD, abnormal accumulation of AP3 is thought to be due partially to increased generation of ,3APP as well as to abnormal processing of it (1, 2).</p><p>Inclusion-body myositis (IBM) is the only human disease in which pathologic accumulation of ,BAPP, including the A,B epitope, and increase of ,BAPP-751 mRNA have been identi- fied outside the brain (4-6).

In addition to accu- mulation of ,BAPP epitopes, there are other striking similari- ties between IBM muscle and AD brain. For example, IBM vacuolated muscle fibers contain amyloid evidenced by Congo red positivity (8) and abnormal accumulation of several pro- teins characteristic of AD brain, including apolipoprotein E (9), ai-antichymotrypsin (10), and ubiquitin (11). By electron microscopy, IBM vacuolated muscle fibers contain 15to The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.

To determine whether overexpression of the ,BAPP gene in muscle and the resultant ,3APP protein overproduction can cause at least some aspects of the IBM phenotype, we utilized replication-deficient ade- novirus as the vector to mediate transfer of /3APP cDNA encoding /3APP-751 into primary cultures of normal adult human muscle. [Replication-deficient recombinant human adenoviruses are suitable to transfer foreign DNA into post- mitotic cells, and they induce a high level of long-lasting expression of the transferred genes (reviewed in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref>).]</p><p>We report that transfer of the ,3APP gene into well- differentiated cultured human muscle fibers resulted in de- creased cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) activity and striking mitochondrial abnormalities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIAL AND METHODS</head><p>Cultured Htlman Muscle. Human muscle cultures were established, as previously described, from satellite cells of portions of diagnostic muscle biopsies (obtained with informed consent) from patients who subsequently were considered free of muscle disease after all tests were performed (14-16). In brief, dissociated myoblasts were purified by double preplating and low-density plating and then were seeded at a concentra- tion of 3 X 105 cells per 60-mm Petri dish and 1 x 105 cells per 35-mm Petri dish <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Cultures were maintained in F14 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), insulin (10 Zg/ml; Sigma), and an antibiotic/ antimycotic mixture (Sigma). This medium promotes differ- entiation of aneurally cultured human muscle and enables its maintenance for several weeks (14). Fifteen independent experiments were performed, each from a different person's muscle biopsy.</p><p>Construction of an Adenovirus Vector Carrying f3APP cDNA. Two adenoviruses, containing the ,3APP gene in sense and antisense orientation, were constructed. Most of the procedures were performed as described by Graham and  Prevec (17).</p><p>In brief, pACCMVpLpA was prepared by modifying the pAC vector (18, 19), accomplished by replacing a region of the adenovirus genome between map units 1.3 and 9.1 with the cytomegalovirus (CMV) early promoter. A cloning cassette was also inserted immediately downstream from the CMV promoter, followed by a fragment of the simian virus 40 genome that Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer disease; ,BAPP, /3-amyloid precursor protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; COX, cytochrome-c oxidase; IBM, inclusion-body myositis; pfu, plaque-forming unit(s). *To whom reprint requests should be addressed.</p><p>FIG. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Phase-contrast micrographs of 4-week-old cultured muscle 2 weeks after I3APP gene transfer (A), control noninfected sister-cultured muscle (B), and sister-cultured muscle infected with recombinant wild adenovirus (C). There are various degrees of vacuolization in the P3APP-overexpressing cultured muscle fibers (A), whereas same-age control muscle fibers are healthy and cross-striated (B and C). Lower-power photomicrograph of 4-week cultured muscle infected for 2 weeks with adenovirus vector carrying f3APP gene in antisense orientation illustrates healthy muscle fibers (D). (A-C, X2400; D, x600.) included the small-t-antigen intron and the polyadenylylation signal. A 3-kb human f3APP cDNA encoding ,3APP-751 con- taining the KPI insert (20) was inserted into pACCMVpLpA.</p><p>Two recombinant viruses were then obtained by cotrans- fection of 293 cells (AdElA-transformed human embryonic kidney cells) with appropriate pACCMVpLpA plasmids and pJM17 plasmid (21). The pJM17 plasmid encodes a full-length adenovirus 5 genome interrupted by the insertion of the bacterial plasmid pBRX at position 3.7 map units, allowing one to exceed the packaging limit for adenovirus (21). Homolo- gous recombination in 293 cells between the pJM17 plasmid and the recomnbinant pACCMVpLpA-f3APP and pACCMV- af3APP (,3APP cDNA in antisense orientation) generated two replication-deficient viruses, which were carrying ,3APP cDNA in sense and antisense orientation. The presence of these DNAs was confirmed by Southern blotting. Viruses were amplified by growth in 293 cells. The appropriate viral plaques were expanded and purified and were stored at -20°C.</p><p>Transfer of the BAPP Gene in Adenovirus Vector into Cultured Human Muscle Fibers. Human muscle fibers cul- tured for 2 weeks (which was 5-7 days after the myoblasts completed their fusion) were infected with doses of I3APP adenovirus ranging from 0.3 x 108 to 1.5 x 108 plaque-forming units (pfu) adenovirus per ml of culture medium. Virus was allowed to remain in the medium for 2 hr and then was removed by several washes. Controls were sister cultures infected with: (a) adenovirus carrying ,3APP cDNA in anti- sense orientation, (b) adenovirus carrying a f3-galactosidase gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, and (c) replication-deficient recombinant "wild" adenovirus vector, composed of the same two plasmids as f3APP adenovirus but not carrying any other foreign cDNA except the CMV promoter gene and the simian virus 40 polyadenylylation signal (22). Experimental and control cul- tured human muscle fibers were studied concurrently. Over- expression of the ,BAPP gene was studied by Northern blots, immunoblots, in situ hybridization, and immunocytochemistry, as previously described (5, 6, 23). Immunofluorescence studies utilized the following rabbit antibodies: (a) R37, against C-terminal sequence 681-695 of ,BAPP (C-,3APP) (24), di- luted 1:200; (b) T97, against N-terminal sequence 18-38 of   ,3APP (N-,BAPP) (24), diluted 1:200; and (c) R1282, against AP3 sequence 1-40 (25), diluted 1:500. For immunoblots, R37 antiserum was used at a dilution of 1:3000.</p><p>Processing of Cultured Muscle for Electron Microscopy (EM) Studies. Cultures grown in 35-mm Petri dishes were fixed in 1.25% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde, postfixed in 1% OS04, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon, as described (26).</p><p>After embedding, the areas of interest were identified by phase-contrast microscopy, marked, and core-drilled out <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. These cores were glued into Epon blanks and thin-sectioned (26).</p><p>COX Staining for Light and Electron Microscopy. This was performed as described (27). For light microscopy, cultures were air-dried and stained for 4 hr. For ultrastructural visu- alization of COX, the cultures were fixed as above and then stained for 7-12 hr in the COX solution. Subsequently, cultures were postfixed in 1% Os04 and processed for EM as above.</p></div>

B3APP adenovirus at 1.5 x 108 pfu/ml caused pronounced vacuolization of muscle fibers and their degeneration within 3-5 days after infection. A dose of 1 x 101 pfu/ml resulted in pronounced vacuolization 10-16 days after infection (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Smaller doses, 0.5 or 0.3 x 108 pfu/ml, also produced degeneration of most of the muscle fibers, but only several weeks after ,BAPP gene transfer; these doses were used in the present study.

The P3APPoverexpressing cultures show strikingly increased immunoreactivity of all ,3APP epitopes (A-C), whereas the uninfected control (D) is negative. (In other control cultures, staining with antibodies against AP3 and N-terminal ,BAPP was also negative.) (x900.) in 80% of the muscle fibers (Fig. <ref type="figure">SA</ref>). COX histochemical reactivity was decreased in both normal-looking nonvacuolated cultured muscle fibers and the vacuolated fibers. At the same 2-week time point, control cultures infected with the recombinant wild adenovirus vector and noninfected cultures had strong COX reactivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5 B and C</ref>).</p><p>Ultrastructural histochemistry of COX, performed 1 week after 3APP gene transfer, revealed that the majority of muscle fiber mitochondria were COX-negative, even though their ultrastructure appeared normal (Fig. <ref type="figure">SD</ref>). Two to 3 weeks later, most of the mitochondria were abnormal; they were either COX-negative or had COX positivity on only a few remaining cristae (Figs. 5 G-I). The mitochondrial amorphous ?, aV '!t -* .. 1:</p><p>.,,. reaction is negative in the ,3APP-overexpressing cultured muscle fibers 15 days after ,3APP gene transfer, whereas sister-cultured muscle fibers infected with the recombinant wild adenovirus vector (B) and uninfected control sister-cultured muscle fibers (C) have very strong COX staining. Ultrastructural cytochemistry of COX reactivity in cultured human muscle 4 days after ,BAPP gene transfer (D), in a sister-cultured muscle infected with the recombinant wild adenovirus vector (E), and in a sister noninfected-control cultured muscle (F) shows that there is strong COX reactivity in the mitochondria of muscle fibers in both controls. ,3APP-overexpressing muscle mito- chondria do not manifest structural abnormalities but they are devoid of COX reactivity (except for one mitochondrion). G-I illustrate examples in abnormal mitochondria of COX activity that is located only in patches on a few remaining cristae (G and H) or on the inner mitochondrial membrane (I).

Four weeks after ,BAPP gene transfer, many mitochondria have lost their cristae and matrix (D).

At the same 2-to 3-week time points, the mito- chondria in control cultures infected with the recombinant wild adenovirus vector and in noninfected cultures had strong COX reactivity on the cristae and inner membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5 E  and F</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">:* i.</formula><p>Transmission EM. Ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormal- ities in ,3APP-overexpressing cultured muscle included their significant enlargement, disorganization, and paucity of cristae, paracrystalline inclusions, vacuolization, and accumula- tion of amorphous material (Figs. 5 G-I and 6 A-C). Mito- chondrial abnormalities increased with the duration of ,3APP overexpression. For example, even though 1 week of 13APP overexpression caused reduction or elimination of COX ac- tivity in the majority of mitochondria (see above), the paracrystalline inclusions were not evident until 3 weeks of overexpression. Clusters of very enlarged and ballooned mitochondria were typically present 4 weeks after 13APP gene transfer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6D</ref>), sometimes in muscle fibers without myofibril disorganization or other features of muscle fiber degen- eration. At the same time points, the mitochondria in control cultures infected with the recombinant wild adenovirus vector and in noninjected cultures had normal mitochondria (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> E and F).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Our studies provide the evidence that overexpression of the f3APP gene and overproduction of 13APP in human muscle fibers can cause decreased COX enzymatic activity and struc- tural abnormalities of mitochondria. The degree of abnormal- ity correlated with the duration of fAPP overexpression.</p><p>Decreased COX activity preceded mitochondrial structural abnormalities. These changes were not simply caused by the adenovirus itself, since there were no mitochondrial abnor- malities in our controls consisting of cultured human muscle infected with recombinant wild adenovirus, adenovirus carry- ing ,BAPP cDNA in antisense orientation, or adenovirus carrying the f-galactosidase reporter gene. Mitochondrial COX deficiency and structural abnormalities were not sec- ondary to the other recognized aspects of f3APP-induced muscle degeneration, since the mitochondrial changes were present earlier, in muscle fibers lacking other signs of degeneration, as well as later in vacuolated muscle fibers. Moreover, our preliminary light-microscopy histochemical studies per- formed in three experiments indicated no differences in succinate dyhydrogenase, a nuclear gene-encoded mitrochondrial enzyme, between cultures overexpressing the 83APP gene and control muscle cultures (data not shown).</p><p>Ragged-red fibers (RRFs), as originally described (29) and defined by their characteristic appearance on Engel-Gomori trichrome staining <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, are an important indicator of mito- chondrial abnormality in human muscle. RRFs and COXnegative muscle fibers are known in IBM muscle biopsies <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>. Mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities and multiple deletions of mitochondria DNA were reported in IBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. Even though RRFs and multiple DNA deletions occur also in aged, otherwise-normal muscle, the percent of RRFs in IBM muscle is higher than that seen in age-matched control muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>.</p><p>Abnormalities of the COX system have been described in AD. For example, COX enzymatic activity and the mRNA for a mitochondrial gene-encoded COX II subunit are decreased in AD brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. Platelets from AD patients also have reduced COX activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>. In addition to decreased COX activity in AD brain, there is generalized depression of elec- tron-transport-chain activity compared with age-matched controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</p><p>COX is a holoenzyme composed of 13 subunits (38). The three largest subunits, COX I-III, are encoded in the mito- chondrial genome, whereas COX IV-XIII subunits are en- coded in the nuclear genome, making COX activity dependent on both mitochondrial and nuclear genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>. The great majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA and are imported from the cytoplasm through complex translocation machinery under the control of the nuclear genome (39). Mitochondrial abnormalities can result from a DNA malfunction within the mitochondria themselves or within the nucleus, or from disturbed import of proteins into mitochondria or alterations of cytoplasmic proteins that in- fluence mitochondria.</p><p>The cause of mitochondrial abnormalities in IBM muscle and AD brain is not known.</p><p>Our study demonstrated a relationship between ,BAPP overexpression and abnormality of COX and mitochondrial structure. Whether the f3APP effect on mitochondria was direct or indirect is not known. Perhaps increased P3APP can affect DNA stability, repair, or transcription.</p><p>A relationship between oxidative stress, mitochondrial ab- normality, and neural degeneration has been proposed (re- viewed in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref>). This mechanism has not yet been explored in muscle tissue. Our preliminary immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies show that superoxide dismutase 1 immunoreactivity and mRNA are increased in ,BAPP- overexpressing cultured muscle fibers. Whether this increase reflects a homeostatic mechanism in response to an increase of free radicals, a direct effect of the overexpressed (3APP, or another phenomenon is not known.</p><p>Our model of human muscle tissue culture offers several advantages for studies of ,BAPP gene overexpression, for example: it enables culturing to a rather mature state the human cells primarily affected by the disease, namely, the muscle fibers (reviewed in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref>); and since human muscle Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 (1996)   1319 fibers can be cultured for several weeks, it is possible to study chronologically the changes consequent to PAPP overexpres- sion. Because adult human neurons cannot be cultured for studying AD, long-term transfer of the 3APP gene into cultured human muscle may provide important information regarding the role of PAPP relevant to the pathogenesis of AD as well as IBM.</p><p>By demonstrating that jAPP gene transfer causes decreased COX activity and structural abnormality of mitochondria, our study suggests that 3APP may play a key role in the induction of those abnormalities, both in AD and in IBM, and provides an excellent experimental model for further molecular studies of mitochondrial abnormalities due to ,3APP overexpression.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>FIG. 2.
