<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients and Methods</head><p>Two sisters (BV and BA), 4 years 4 months and 6 years 5 months old, respectively, were referred to our hospital because of mental retardation and severe language delay. Neurological examination did not show any focal symptom.</p><p>The girls were born to healthy unrelated Italian parents after uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. They started walking unaided at 24 months and started speaking the first words at 30 months. The younger sister had a febrile seizure at 18 months. Routine blood and urine analysis and extensive investigation for neurometabolic disorders (including screening for mitochondrial disorders and metabolic screening of a 24-hour sample of urine with assessment of amino acids, organic acids, oligosaccharides, and mucopolysaccharides) were normal. Despite these preliminary results, the girls underwent conventional MRI and 1 H MRS scanning of the brain, following our standard clinical protocol.</p><p>Magnetic resonance (MR) studies were performed in the same setting, using a 1.5-T clinical MR scanner (Advantage Signa 1.5; GE, Milwaukee, WI), as described previously. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Localized MR spectra were determined by using a singlevoxel short echo time (TE) stimulated echo acquisition mode technique (STEAM; repetition time [TR] ϭ 2,010 mec; TE ϭ 30 msec; mixing time ϭ 13.7 msec; 256 scans; volume of interest dimension ϭ 3.4 ml). Spectra were processed <ref type="bibr">8</ref> off-line with the Spectral Analysis GE/Interactive Data Language (SAGE/IDL), and evaluation of metabolites concentration was performed by using a method similar to that described by Ernst and co-workers. <ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">10</ref> MRI was normal, but <ref type="bibr">1</ref> H MRS revealed the total absence of the Cr/PCr peak in the paraventricular white matter, in the cerebellum, and in the parieto-occipital cortex (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The Cr biosynthetic pathway was therefore investigated.</p><p>Blood concentrations of Cr and GAA turned out to be within normal values, thus excluding a systemic Cr synthesis deficit (serum Cr: in BV and BA, 122 and 95 mol/L, respectively; normal, 10 -200 mol/L; serum guanidinoacetate: in BV and BA, 0.3 and 0.5 mol/L, respectively; normal, 0.4 -3.0 mol/L). Therapy was first attempted with oral administration of L-arginine (300 mg/kg/day) to rule out a possible deficit of the first biochemical step of endogenous Cr synthesis (ie, arginine:glycine amidinotransferase). Because <ref type="bibr">1</ref> H MRS revealed no Cr increase after 2 months of L-arginine treatment, oral Cr monohydrate was subsequently started at a dose of 400 mg/kg/day. The effects of treatment were monitored by consecutive <ref type="bibr">1</ref> H MRS scanning performed after 3, 9, and 16 months of continuous Cr intake. After 3 months of therapy, brain Cr concentration reached 40% of normal value, and after 9 months it reached 80%. At this time, blood Cr had increased to 344 mol/L in BA and 328 mol/L in BV. After 16 months, brain Cr was restored to normal in the gray matter and cerebellum, but it was still slightly less than the normal value in the hemispheric white matter (Fig 2).</p><p>Nonverbal intelligence, visual-perceptual abilities, and fine motor skills were rated before and during therapy. For this purpose, we applied the performance and the eye-hand coordination subscales of the Griffiths Developmental Scales in the younger sister (BV), <ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12</ref> and we used the Leiter In-ternational Performance Scale (LIPS) <ref type="bibr">13</ref> and the Visual Motor Integration Test (VMI) <ref type="bibr">14</ref> with the older sister.</p><p>Before starting therapy, BV was 4 years 4 months old and had a performance score of 42 and an eye-hand coordination score of 57, as measured by using the Griffiths Developmental Scales. After 16 months of therapy, the scores increased to 68 and 62, respectively, thus demonstrating an acceleration of the rate of cognitive development (corresponding to 20 months of progress in 16 months). It was only feasible to assess BV's visual-perceptual abilities after 16 months of Cr supplementation, because at the time of the first evaluation she was not even able to copy the simplest figures of the VMI. At this time, she received a standard score of 77, which was in the borderline range for her chronological age. Language abilities also improved but at a slower rate, compared with nonverbal skills, and were discrepant with respect to mental age expectation.</p><p>At the time of the first observation, BA was 6 years 5 months old and she achieved an LIPS IQ score of 65 and a VMI standard score of 60. After 16 months of therapy, her LIPS IQ score was almost unchanged, but the VMI standard score had increased to 77. Therefore, in a similar manner as her sister, she made an unusually rapid progress in the acquisition of visual perceptual and fine motor skills, whereas the rate of general cognitive development, as assessed by LIPS, was slow.</p><p>Concerning language outcome, a constant lag in the acquisition of different language skills was observed, when assessed by standardized tests of productive and receptive vo-cabulary and grammar. However, analysis of spontaneous speech (ie, free conversation with parents and/or peers, and play situations) revealed a marked improvement in communicative intent, together with a better capacity to correctly follow simple verbal commands and a more adequate use of language, because she expressed herself in a coherent and intelligible way. She also demonstrated better socioemotional behavior, with improvement of attention span, mood control, and social skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The first report of an inborn error of Cr metabolism was described by Stockler and associates 2 in a 22month-old boy with progressive muscular hypotonia and extrapyramidal symptoms. The baby had systemic depletion of Cr and extremely low excretion of creatinine. A brain MRI scan revealed signal abnormalities in the globus pallidus, and 1 H MRS scanning showed the absence of brain Cr and high concentrations of guanidinoacetate, both in plasma and in the brain. Clinical symptoms and biochemical abnormalities improved after oral treatment with Cr monohydrate. On the basis of these observations, an enzyme defect in Cr Overlapped in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectra of the parieto-occipital cortex in a patient with brain creatine deficiency. The solid tracing spectrum was determined before treatment; the dotted tracing spectrum was determined after 9 months of oral treatment with creatine. Resonance assignments are the result of N-acetylaspartate (NAA; at 2.01 ppm), creatine and creatine phosphate (Cr/PCr; at 3.05 ppm), cholinecontaining compounds (Cho; at 3.20 ppm), and myoinositol (mI; at 3.56 ppm).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig 2. Time course of brain creatine restoration (as percentage of normal concentrations in young healthy adult controls) detected by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 2 sisters</head><p>with brain creatine deficiency (dotted tracing ϭ Patient BA; solid tracing ϭ Patient BV ). The graph refers to a 16month period of therapy with oral creatine administration at a dose of 400 mg/kg/day. biosynthesis was first hypothesized and subsequently proved at the level of GAMT activity, in the liver of the patient. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The authors also identified the mutation in the GAMT alleles of this patient, which established the genetic nature of the disorder. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Two additional cases were subsequently identified by Schulze and associates <ref type="bibr">5</ref> and by Ganesan and colleagues <ref type="bibr">6</ref> in a 4-year-old girl and in a 5-year-old boy. Both had the same biochemical and brain spectroscopic abnormalities, and, clinically, they presented the same movement disorder described previously, with dyskinesia and dystonias in addition to tonic seizures that were resistant to antiepileptic drugs. A brain MRI scan confirmed the abnormalities in the globus pallidus and also showed a diffuse signal alteration in the hemispheric white matter.</p><p>In the present report, we describe 2 cases of a new error of Cr metabolism characterized by different clinical and biochemical features. In fact, differently from the patients previously reported, the 2 sisters only suffered from mild mental retardation and severe language delay, whereas their blood concentrations of Cr and GAA and brain MRI scans were normal. In other words, the Cr deficiency was only confined to the brain. Because Cr synthesis is currently believed to occur only in the liver and pancreas, <ref type="bibr">1</ref> it is likely that the 2 sisters suffer from a specific dysfunction of the central nervous system Cr transporter. Nonetheless, as in the GAMT deficit cases, oral administration of Cr monohydrate restored the Cr concentration of the brain and led to obvious clinical improvement.</p><p>Biosynthesis and physiological functions of Cr have been addressed, but still little is known about brain Cr uptake and brain Cr distribution. <ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16</ref> Brain Cr contents of our patients increased linearly to 80% of the normal values during the first 9 months of therapy. In contrast, the patient with GAMT deficiency reached the same amount of brain Cr during a longer period of therapy and with a biphasic trend-a fast phase (in the first 3 months) and a slower phase (in the following 22 months). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> In our cases, it might be assumed that the Cr transporter function has been forced by markedly increasing blood Cr concentration, which thus indicates hypofunction of the transporter protein complex.</p><p>In conclusion, these data suggest the existence of a new Cr metabolism disorder that might be caused by either defective Cr brain transport or other unknown defects. Because blood tests were normal in these patients, <ref type="bibr">1</ref> H MRS scanning proved to be the only diagnostic tool and the only means to monitor the efficacy of treatment. This disorder is treatable; therefore, its early diagnosis might be critical, to prevent irreversible brain damage. It must be considered in the differential diagnosis of the broad range of unexplained neuropsychiatric disorders in children and it can be ruled out only by us-ing in vivo <ref type="bibr">1</ref> H MRS, which, at present, is available in many clinical MR systems and is easy to perform. Holoprosencephaly is a brain malformation caused by impaired midline cleavage of the embryonic forebrain. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> It can be graded according to the degree of severity as alobar, semilobar, or lobar holoprosencephaly. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Various degrees of facial dysmorphism are associated with this disorder, graded from hypotelorism or single maxillary central incisor to cyclopia, single median eye. The incidence of holoprosencephaly was estimated as 0.4% among induced abortions. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> It is usually sporadic and occasionally associated with numerous chromosomal abnormalities, especially with trisomy 13, and in most cases the cause is unknown. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Cytogenetic analysis defined as many as 12 loci implicated in the pathogenesis of holoprosencephaly. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene on chromosome 7q36 has been identified as a gene responsible for holoprosencephaly in humans. <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6</ref> The Shh gene consists of three exons spanning about 15 kb, encoding a polypeptide of 462 amino acids. The SHH protein is a secreted protein that is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum and cleaved of its signal peptide. Then, it undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage into a 19-kd amino-terminal product (SHH-N) and a carboxy-terminal product of 25-kd (SHH-C) in the endoplasmic reticulum. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> To date, 9 of 42 families with familial autosomal dominant holoprosencephaly have been reported to have Shh gene mutations. In contrast, only 1 of 184 sporadic cases of holoprosencephaly was attributable to Shh gene mutation. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> All mutations previously reported are distributed in the SHH-N and SHH-C domain, and none have been found in the sequence of the signal peptide.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case Report</head><p>The patient was the first child of unrelated healthy parents. His mother caught a common cold at the fifth month of gestation. He was born at term by cesarean section because of premature rupture of the membranes and velamentous insertion. Birth weight was 2,680 g, length was 44.8 cm (Ϫ2.7 SD), and head circumference was 29.5 cm (Ϫ2.9 SD). He was nursed in an incubator for 1 week because of respiratory disturbance and poor sucking. He had a septonasal recess and peculiar face at birth. At 1 month of age, he showed three generalized tonic-clonic convulsions with fever. He underwent craniotomy with early closure of cranial sutures at 7 months of age. He showed severe psychomotor delay, however, but no regression. He has been institutionalized since 3 years of age.</p><p>At the age of 19 years, he showed small stature (body height, 121 cm [Ϫ8.8 SD]; body weight, 14.8 kg), microcephaly (head circumference, 43.2 cm [Ϫ9.8 SD]), and lowgrade body temperature (mean, 34.0°C). He had many minor anomalies (hypotelorism, low nasal bridge, hypoplasia of nasal septum, macroglossia, micropenis, and cryptorchidism) and joint contractures at knees and ankles. Neurological examination disclosed severe psychomotor developmental delay as follows: no walking, no speech, and no response to spoken commands. There were no abnormal laboratory findings in the biochemical analysis, including liver and renal functions and serum electrolytes. Chromosomal analysis was 46, XY. Electroencephalogram revealed no paroxysmal activity. Brainstem auditory-evoked potential and short latency somatosensory-evoked potential were normal. Cranial computed tomography showed mild dilatation of the posterior part of the lateral ventricles, or colpocephaly. A cranial magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed partial agenesis of the anterior part of the corpus callosum and fusion of the frontal lobes and basal ganglia across the midline, which indicates holoprosencephaly (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).

Clinical variety has also been observed among the affected members of the same family. Studies of familial cases have indicated that there is no genotype-phenotype correlation between the type of mutation and its location in the Shh gene. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Genotype-phenotype correlation in the isolated cases, or the phenotype of the case reported here carrying the mutation in the signal peptide, are still unclear. The factors that modulate the clinical severity remain to be clarified. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Fig 1 <ref type="figure">.</ref> T2-weighted axial (A) and sagittal (B) magnetic resonance imaging scans of the patient.

A heterozygous T-to-C transversion at position 50, which results in an amino acid change of leucine (CTG) to proline (CCG), was shown.</head><p>In this study, we showed that the patient had a heterozygous mutation in the sequence of the signal peptide of the Shh gene. Signal peptides have three domains, ie, an amino-terminal positively charged region, a central, hydrophobic part (h-region), and a more polar carboxy-terminal domain. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The h-region, which consists of strings of leucine residues, is critical for translocation. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The amino acid replacement of leucine with proline, in the h-region in our case, did not markedly change its hydrophobicity but influenced formation of the beta structure of the peptide. It probably disturbs the translocation of the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum and may lead to holoprosencephaly because of haploinsufficiency of Shh.</p><p>Our case showed partial agenesis of the anterior portion of the corpus callosum. Agenesis of the corpus callosum is frequently associated with multiple pathogenetic factors. In partial agenesis, the posterior part is usually missing because the corpus callosum develops in an anteroposterior manner. However, anterior agenesis can occur with a mild type of holoprosencephaly. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The SHH protein induces ventral neurons in the forebrain, <ref type="bibr">13</ref> and holoprosencephaly lacks the division of hemispheres, especially in the anterior part of the forebrain. There have been few studies of the Shh gene mutation related to the associated brain anomalies. Our case suggested that the signal peptide mutation of the Shh gene may result in a milder type of holoprosencephaly. Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is a syndrome dominated by childhood-onset dystonia and is characterized by a dramatic and sustained response to levodopa. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> There are two known types of DRD, namely, autosomal dominant GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH)deficient DRD and autosomal recessive tyrosine hy-droxylase-deficient DRD. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> Using usual genomic DNA sequencing of the gene (GCH1) coding for GTPCH, the enzyme which catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (the cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase), more than 50 different GCH1 mutations have been found in patients with DRD. <ref type="bibr">1,2,4 -14</ref> However, approximately 40% of genetically examined DRD patients have no mutations in the coding region (including the splice sites) of GCH1, although it is assumed that most patients with dominantly inherited DRD probably have a GT-PCH dysfunction. Thus, the present conventional genomic DNA testing for the autosomal dominant form of DRD is not suitable for routine clinical practice. In this investigation, we sequenced the GCH1 coding region in four DRD pedigrees and identified independent mutations in three families but not in a three-generation family. To evaluate whether this "mutation-negative" family with DRD has a large deletion in GCH1 that cannot be detected by usual genomic DNA sequencing of this gene, we conducted GCH1 cDNA sequence and genomic Southern blot analyses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In Family A, we found no mutation in either the coding region or the splice sites of GCH1 by conventional genomic DNA sequencing of this gene, whereas we identified independent heterozygous mutations in the three other families (see Table <ref type="table">)</ref>. Karyotype analysis demonstrated no abnormality in the proband of Family A. Additional genomic DNA sequencing of the essential part of the 5Ј region and the poly(A) signal on the 3Ј end of GCH1 in this index patient failed to reveal any mutation. However, in 6 subjects (4 affected members [I-1, II-2, II-4, and III-4] and both twins [III-1 and III-2]) in Family A, four GCH1 mRNA transcripts (the normal cDNA and three different mutant cDNAs lacking either exon 3, exons 3 and 4, or exons 3, 4, and 5) were detected by sequencing of the nested RT-PCR products (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">1B</ref>). Each mutant cDNA had a predictable premature termination codon caused by a frameshift. Southern blot analysis of HindIII-digested genomic DNA, using the RT-PCR or exon 2-PCR product probe, revealed an aberrant band (7.8 kb) in all of the 6 subjects (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">2A</ref>). This abnormal band was not detected in their 2 unaffected siblings (II-3 and III-3) and 2 spouses (I-2 and II-5) and in 20 normal controls. A normal band (9.0 kb) shown by the exon 2-PCR product probe was also hybridized with the exon 3-PCR product probe (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">2B</ref>), indicating that both GCH1 exons 2 and 3 are located in this normal fragment. However, the 7.8-kb aberrant band, which is derived from the 9.0-kb normal band, disappeared when the exon 3-PCR product was used as a probe. Thus, there was a large heterozygous deletion (ϳ1.2 kb genomic deletion in GCH1, based on Southern blotting of HindIIIdigested genomic DNA) involving exon 3 in the 6 subjects in Family A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report of a large GCH1 deletion in DRD, which cannot be detected by usual genomic DNA sequencing of GCH1.</p><p>In previous reports on DRD, in which a relatively large number of families was examined genetically, 30 of 74 pedigrees had no mutations in the coding region (including the splicing junctions) of GCH1. <ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> Because the 30 pedigrees include families having an apparently sporadic patient or only a few affected siblings, <ref type="bibr">9 -12</ref> there is a possibility that some of these families might have autosomal recessive tyrosine hydroxylase-deficient DRD. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> However, for dominantly inherited mutation-negative pedigrees with DRD, possible explanations are the following: (1) a mutation in noncoding regulatory regions of GCH1, (2) a large deletion of GCH1, (3) an intragenic duplication or inversion of GCH1, and (4) a mutation in regulatory genes having an influence on GCH1 expression. An earlier chromosomal study failed to reveal any largescale deletions or gene rearrangements at the DRD locus on chromosome 14q. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Although the essential part of the 5Ј region was sequenced in 10 DRD families, a In Family A (English-Canadian), no mutation in either the coding region or the splice sites of the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene (GCH1) was identified.</p><p>b Mutations in Family B (European-American) and Family C (African-American) have been found in other dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) pedigrees previously. <ref type="bibr">7,12 c</ref> A novel missense mutation in Family D (German/Irish, American Indian/French) affects a highly conserved amino acid residue. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> only one family had two point mutations on one allele; the functional significance of these mutations remains uncertain because mRNA was not analyzed. <ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">13</ref> The poly(A) signal on the 3Ј end was also sequenced in six of the 10 pedigrees, but none of the six pedigrees demonstrated mutations. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> These previous negative findings of GCH1 analyses would have made the possibility of a mutation in, as yet undefined, regulatory genes in coding region mutation-negative pedigrees with DRD more likely. However, our finding of the deletion in Family A suggests that the possibility of a large deletion in GCH1, which is undetectable by the conventional genomic DNA sequence analysis of this gene, should be considered before examination of a mutation in other genes.</p><p>In Family A, our data indicate that the large GCH1 deletion probably includes the entire region of the exon 3-PCR product (from intron 2 to intron 3); however, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that a small part of one of the ends of this region might not be deleted. Sequencing of the whole introns 2 and 3 was not conducted, because the normal intronic sequence of these relatively long introns is unknown. In addition to the large genomic deletion with probable involvement of both splicing junctions of exon 3, variable skipping of the downstream exon(s) (exon 4 or exons 4 and 5) occurred in some mutant mRNA transcripts in Family A. A mutation that abolishes a splice site typically causes loss of an adjacent single exon because of defective splicing. <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">18</ref> However, skipping of the additional exon(s) and complex patterns of exon skipping have been reported in other genes. <ref type="bibr">18 -20</ref> Although we cannot explain the reason for skipping of exon 4 or exons 4 and 5, the large GCH1 deletion may have had an influence on the recognition or processing of the downstream exons.</p><p>All of the mutant alleles found in our four DRD families most likely produce dysfunctional GTPCH proteins. However, the reason for intrafamilial phenotypic variability in Family A (4 affected members vs relatively unaffected twins) is unknown as is the case in many previously reported DRD pedigrees that showed marked variation in expressivity of GCH1 mutations. <ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">14</ref> Other genetic and/or environmental factors probably modulate the outcome of a GCH1 mutation.</p><p>In conclusion, our finding of a large GCH1 deletion Parkinson's disease (PD), one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, is usually sporadic, but, in familial forms, can be caused by mutations in the ␣-synuclein gene. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> Two mutations, A53T and A30P, were found in different families with PD.

Brains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and blocks were cut from various cortical and subcortical regions, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin and by the Kluver-Barrera method. In each case, 4-m-thick sections of the temporal lobe, midbrain, and upper pons were cut and immunostained by using the avidin-biotinperoxidase complex method with diaminobenzidine as a chromogen.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>LBs are neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions that consist of filaments and granular structures, which contain ␣-synuclein as well as other proteins. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> In this study, we have identified synphilin-1 as a component of LBs in patients with PD. That synphilin-1 was not found in AD protein aggregates indicates specificity and suggests that synphilin-1 deposition could be specific for lesions in which ␣-synuclein is a major component. Although synphilin-1 was detected in most LBs analyzed, we did not observe deposition of synphilin-1 in Lewy neurites. Lewy neurites are dystrophic neurites that occur in addition to LBs. The role of Lewy neurites is still unknown, but they have a similar immunohistochemical profile as LBs. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Thus, our data suggest that LBs and Lewy neurites may have a heterogeneous composition and that they could be associated with different aspects of the disease.</p><p>In our material, the central cores of LBs often contained synphilin-1, which suggests that synphilin-1 is not secondarily deposited on preexisting inclusions and that it could play a role in LB formation. Synphilin-1 was detected in 80% to 90% of LBs not only in substantia nigra but also in other regions of the brain characteristically affected in PD, such as locus ceruleus, oculomotor nucleus, and cerebral cortex. That synphilin-1 could not be detected in 10% to 20% of LBs could be the result of low sensitivity of the synphilin-1 antibody used for this study. An alternative explanation is that LB formation does not require synphilin-1. Generation of other synphilin-1 antibodies may help clarify the exact extent of synphilin-1 deposition in LBs.</p><p>In cell culture, synphilin-1 promotes the formation of inclusions, which can be labeled for both ␣-synuclein and synphilin-1. Our data suggest that an analogous process may occur in vivo. ␣-Synuclein can aggregate by itself in vitro, <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr">[19]</ref> but relatively high concentrations are required, which suggests that synphilin-1 could accelerate the deposition of ␣-synuclein within the cell.</p><p>The genetic loci for most PD cases have not been identified yet. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Our data provide a rationale to a search for mutations in synphilin-1 as possible contributors to familial PD. Similarly to ␣-synuclein, the function of synphilin-1 is unknown. The presence of ankyrin domains within synphilin-1 protein suggests that it could be a cytoskeletal-related protein. Future studies on the function of synphilin-1 may be helpful to understand the normal function of ␣-synuclein as well as to clarify the role of ␣-synuclein and synphilin-1 in the formation of LBs and the pathogenesis of PD. Oxidative stress has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. Supporting evidence of oxidative stress comes from a variety of in vitro studies that show that free radicals are capable of mediating neuronal degeneration. Nitric oxide (NO) is cytotoxic, especially to neurons, under certain conditions. NO contains an unpaired electron that can combine with free radicals such as superoxide to form peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite leads to lipid per-oxidation, dysfunction of enzyme, and DNA damage. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> Particularly in mitochondria, peroxynitritemediated injury induces inhibition of the electron transport chain, <ref type="bibr">3</ref> followed by opening of the permeability transition pore located on the mitochondrial inner membrane. These events cause cell death. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Recent reports have demonstrated the widespread nitration of tyrosine residues in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) brains. <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6</ref> When transition metal ions or certain metalloproteins such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) are present, the rate of tyrosine nitration is high. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> This nitration has been suggested to be pathologically important in certain neurodegenerative diseases. Although peroxynitrite can react with both copper/zinc-SOD (Cu/Zn-SOD) and Mn-SOD, the latter is inactivated by the nitration. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The activities of Mn-SOD and Cu/Zn-SOD in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are correlated with certain neurogenic diseases. <ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9</ref> These findings expanded our interests toward the study of tyrosine nitration in the protein of CSF. Hence, we analyzed nitrotyrosinecontaining proteins by using nitrotyrosine antibody in the CSF of patients who demonstrated intracerebral degenerative processes.</p></div>

The protein-transferred membrane was also treated with sheep polyclonal anti-human Mn-SOD (1:1,000 dilution; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) antibody. Further treatment of the membrane was the same as above, using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-sheep Ig antibody from rabbit (Amersham). The x-ray film was scanned by using a densitograph system. The levels of nitrotyrosine-and SODpositive proteins were presented as relative density ratios to those of the internal standard. The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Continuous variables were compared by the Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.</p></div>

The level of the nitrated 96-kd protein in patients with PSP, spinocerebellar degeneration, cerebrovascular disease, and normal pressure hydrocephalus was almost equal to that in control group. In Mn-SOD analysis, PSP patients showed significantly higher levels than the control group ( p Ͻ 0.01). Neither sex difference nor age-related correlation in the 96-kd protein, detected by either nitrotyrosine antibody or Mn-SOD antibody, was observed. The amount of nitrotyrosine-positive protein did not correlate with that of Mn-SOD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This is the first report that identifies a nitrotyrosinecontaining protein in human CSF. The 96-kd protein recognized by the nitrotyrosine antibody was also stained by the Mn-SOD antibody. This 96-kd protein was dissociated into 48-and 24-kd proteins. Human Mn-SOD is a homotetramer (96 kd) containing one manganese atom and nine tyrosine residues in each subunit. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Thus, the 96-kd protein was considered to be a tetrameric Mn-SOD. The presence of Mn-SOD in CSF is supported by several reports. <ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9</ref> However, se-quencing of this protein by the microsequence technique failed because of insufficient sample amounts (data not shown). The proteins, which showed higher molecular mass bands than monomeric Mn-SOD (see Fig 1), stained only after immunoprecipitation. As the same phenomenon has been reported previously, 1 the characteristics of these bands were unknown. Peroxynitrite can also react with Cu/Zn-SOD. However, nitrated Cu/Zn-SOD, which should be 32 kd of homodimer proteins, was not observed. Mn-SOD is a primary antioxidant enzyme that functions to remove superoxide radicals in mitochondria. Nitration of the tyrosine residue of Mn-SOD leads to inactivation of this enzyme <ref type="bibr">7</ref> and an increase in  mitochondrial reactive oxygen species level, and consequently damage to other mitochondrial proteins and mtDNA. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> In the present experiment, the amount of nitrated 96-kd protein, possibly Mn-SOD, was higher in PD, AD, and ALS groups than in the control group. These findings agree with recent reports that have demonstrated the widespread nitration of tyrosine residues in AD and PD brains. In PD patients, the presence of nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity has been observed in Lewy bodies within melanized neurons and in amorphous deposits associated with intact and degenerating neurons. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Good and associates 6 also reported colocalization of nitrotyrosine with the neurofibrillary tangles of AD. Amyloid ␤-peptide is known to stimulate NO production. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> The signature of peroxynitrite involvement has also been demonstrated in ALS. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> The cause of ALS has recently been linked to glutamate through convincing clinical evidence. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Motor neurons in the spinal cord are selectively injured by chronic exposure to glutamate and this is mediated by the formation of NO in nonmotor neurons. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">21</ref> Peroxynitrite may affect neurofilament assembly and cause neurofilament accumulation in motorneurons. The inactivation of Mn-SOD might be implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS. These observations could link oxidative stress caused by NO with a key pathological mechanism in PD, AD, and, especially, ALS. Nitration of Mn-SOD in CSF may be a marker for peroxynitritemediated oxidative stress in several neurodegenerative diseases. In contrast to PD, AD, and ALS, nitrated tyrosine residue-containing protein was not elevated in PSP patients, whereas obvious elevation of Mn-SOD was observed. This finding indicates that oxidative stress caused by factors other than NO might be one of the important factors in the pathogenesis of PSP, although the cause of this disease is quite obscure. The precise pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still unknown, although genetic and toxic factors are postulated to contribute to the development of PD. Many previous studies have investigated genetic factors of PD. In recent twin studies, one large study indicated that no genetic component was evident when the disease began after age 50 years. However, genetic factors seemed to be important when disease began at or before age 50 years. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Another twin study that used positron emission tomography has revealed a strong genetic influence in PD. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Polymorphism of the ␣-synuclein gene, <ref type="bibr">3</ref> the cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 gene, <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and glutathione transferase gene <ref type="bibr">5</ref> have been investigated for causing sporadic PD. As models of toxic factors, 6-hydroxydopamine, and 1-methyl-4phenylpyridinium (MPP ϩ ), an active metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, cause parkinsonism. <ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7</ref> These neurotoxins are taken into dopaminergic neurons via dopamine transporter (DAT). The distribution of DAT resembles closely the pathological lesion of PD, <ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9</ref> and the loss of dopaminergic neurons remarkably parallels the level of DAT mRNA. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Furthermore, mutants of DAT have been reported to enhance the transport of MPP ϩ selectively. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> These results show that DAT could be related to the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons.</p><p>In our previous study, we determined structure and organization of the DAT gene. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> To clarify whether polymorphisms of the DAT gene are associated with PD, we screened polymorphisms out of all coding regions of this gene by using the direct sequence and capillary electrophoresis system-based singlestrand conformation polymorphism (CE-SSCP), and we compared their distribution between patients with PD and normal control subjects.</p></div>

Direct sequence of the exon 9 fragment revealed an A3 G transition at nucleotide 1215 (1215A/G) (the translation starting site in cDNA of the DAT gene is designated as ϩ1), and that of the exon 15 fragment revealed a T3 C transition at nucleotide 1898 (1898T/C) (Fig) <ref type="figure">.</ref> Both transitions were single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

Totally, we screened 48 subjects and 96 alleles of the DAT gene in PD subjects and controls, and we screened out all major polymorphisms whose allelic frequency was more than 5%, with a significance level of 7.27 ϫ 10 Ϫ3 . Probably, there is no other polymorphism that contributes mainly to the pathogenesis of PD in all exons of the DAT gene.</p><p>We studied the distribution of these two polymorphisms in all of the subjects by using dot blot hybridization analysis with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">1</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the present study, we screened the polymorphisms out of the entire coding region of the DAT gene and compared the differences in their distribution between patients with PD and normal controls. Our results indicate that there are two polymorphisms in all the exons of the DAT gene and that one (1215G) is significantly more frequent in the controls than in the patients with PD. The results suggest that 1215G is associated with decreasing the susceptibility to PD.</p><p>Previous studies reported that polymorphism of the DAT gene was not associated with PD. <ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">17</ref> However, these studies examined only a variable number of tandem repeat polymorphisms in the 3Ј-untranslated region, and these did not cover exonal polymorphisms. The exonal polymorphisms will be more related to the function of the gene and more conservative than a variable number of tandem repeats in the untranslated re- gion. Therefore, investigation of exonal polymorphisms in this gene might lead to determination of their contribution to PD. Furthermore, polymorphisms of the cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 gene <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and glutathione transferase gene <ref type="bibr">5</ref> have been investigated in recent studies. Polymorphisms of the cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 gene were reported to be associated with PD at first, but this notion was not reproduced by all groups. Although the studies on these genes suggest that toxic factors contribute to the development of PD, such a genetic predisposition cannot fully explain the mechanism for selective neurodegeneration.</p><p>At the beginning, we assumed that nucleotide variations with amino acid substitutions might cause a change in the protein functions of DAT. However, we found only two polymorphisms in all coding regions, and they caused no amino acid substitutions. In this sense, DAT is much conserved in both the nucleotide and the protein levels. If 1215G was associated with development of PD, there would be a mechanism other than one using the protein function of DAT. Therefore, a few possibilities could be suggested. The first possibility is that 1215G would link to the polymorphisms of other genes near the locus. The second and most likely possibility is that the polymorphisms in other regions of the DAT gene would link to 1215G and might decrease the expression level of DAT mRNA. The lowered expression of DAT mRNA might decrease the uptake of toxic factors via DAT and prevent the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. In fact, the angiotensinogen gene has two mutations, and these mutations are linked to each other. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> The mutation in the 5Ј-flanking region affects the basal transcription rate of the angiotensinogen gene and contributes to essential hypertension.</p><p>However, our study needs some cautionary notes. First, we enrolled subjects from an ethnic population. Second, our patients were diagnosed as having PD only clinically. All those in the PD group will not have idiopathic PD despite careful clinical selection. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Therefore, further and larger studies that recruit subjects from other ethnic populations or patients diagnosed pathologically would reveal a more obvious relationship between DAT and PD, and clarify the mechanism that would explain how the DAT gene contributes to the pathogenesis of PD.</p><p>In conclusion, we found two polymorphisms in the exons of the DAT gene, and one of them was associated with decreasing the susceptibility to PD. The investigation on the transporter-based mechanism might explain selective cell loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD and provide a new clue for the prevention of the disease. myopathy, 2 myotubular myopathy, <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and congenital fiber-type disproportion. However, many patients remain with the clinical characteristics of congenital myopathy with nonspecific diagnostic morphological features.</p><p>Apoptosis, originally defined by morphological changes mainly in the nuclei, <ref type="bibr">4</ref> is an active cell death under genetic control. Many apoptotic signaling pathways have been identified. Many of them require the sequential activation of caspases, the final step of which is the activation of caspase-3. Activated caspase-3 processes the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD), which results in activation of the caspaseactivated DNase (CAD) that causes DNA fragmentation. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Caspase-9, which is upstream of caspase-3, is activated by cytochrome c/apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1); cytochrome c released from mitochondria binds to Apaf-1 and then activates caspase-9. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The release of cytochrome c is inhibited by Bcl-2, and Bax functions conversely. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The apoptotic process is involved in many diseases including cancers, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and other pathological conditions. Several muscle diseases are also reported to be related to apoptosis, but whether they are is still being debated. <ref type="bibr">8 -11</ref> We report a patient with an unusual congenital myopathy with pronounced myonuclear changes on light microscopic examination. To determine whether an apoptotic process was involved in this case, we examined muscle sampled for biopsy by electron microscopy, by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method, and by immunohistochemistry. The results strongly support the presence of apoptotic degeneration in our patient.</p></div>

These findings suggest that this patient shares a pathogenetic mechanism that leads to muscle fiber degeneration in common with these two diseases.</p><p>As a rule, cells involved in apoptosis finally form ap-optotic bodies; ie, fragments of the degraded apoptotic cell are enclosed by a cell membrane and phagocytosed by macrophages or neighboring cells. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> However, there were no visible apoptotic bodies in this patient. The muscle cell is a multinucleated cell, and it is unlikely that all the nuclei in a cell undergo apoptosis. Instead, a single or a limited number of myonuclei scattered throughout the cell may undergo apoptosis independently. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Therefore, apoptosis does not occur throughout a long muscle cell but does so focally or segmentally with myofibrillar degeneration around the apoptotic myonuclei. Although the cause of myofibrillar degeneration in this patient is unknown, it may have been initiated by activated caspases that have the capacity to cleave actin, <ref type="bibr">16</ref> and calpains, <ref type="bibr">17,</ref><ref type="bibr">18</ref> which are subsequently processed by proteasomes. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Finally, only focally degraded cellular debris in a muscle cell is removed and, therefore, no apoptotic bodies are formed.</p><p>In this patient, although we detected 40% of abnormal myonuclei, mainly showing chromatin condensation, only 2% of myonuclei were TUNEL positive. This may reflect a difference in the molecules that carry out chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. For example, apoptosis-inducing factor causes chromatin condensation but fragments DNA into nucleosome size. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> We demonstrated immunohistochemically the activation of caspase-9 and the subsequent caspase-3 activation in the same fibers. In this patient, down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression, which is weakly expressed in type 2 fibers in normal muscle, <ref type="bibr">20</ref> and up-regulation of Bax, which shows no expression in normal muscle, may also reflect the proposed apoptotic process. We could not find activated caspase-3-and TUNEL-positive myonuclei in the same fibers, perhaps because the apoptotic signaling process occurred too rapidly.</p><p>In conclusion, this morphological study strongly suggests that apoptotic mechanisms play a role in the pathogenesis of this newly recognized congenital myopathy.</p><p>We thank Prof S.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients and Methods Patient</head><p>A 46-year-old German woman presented with gait disturbance that had progressed for 3 years, urinary urge incontinence, and hearing loss. Neurological examination showed moderate spastic tetraparesis, generalized symmetrical hyperreflexia except for depressed ankle jerks, bilateral extensor plantar response, diminished vibration sensation in the legs, and impaired superficial sensation in a stocky pattern. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated confluent areas of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images in the periventricular white matter. Brainstem auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials were impaired bilaterally. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography indicated a sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy with mixed axonal and demyelinating features. Complete neurological and neurophysiological examination of her two symptomatic daughters (ages 14 and 21 years) was normal. Sural nerve biopsy in the patient revealed a neuropathy with an approximately 40% decrease of large myelinated fibers. Occasional clusters of regenerated axons and axons with thin myelin sheaths were observed. Many fibers showed axonal spheroids. Electron microscopy revealed that they were composed of osmiophilic granules and irregular filaments characteristic of polyglucosan bodies (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). GBE activity in the patient's leukocytes was 20% of the lower limit of the normal range (0.02 nmol/min/mg of protein; normal, 0.1-0.5 nmol/min/mg of protein; n ϭ 40). The two daughters displayed intermediate levels of GBE activity of 80% (0.08 nmol/min/mg of protein) in leukocytes. In the patient's leukocytes, phosphorylase a (a ϩ b) [5.7 (19.3) nmol/min/mg of protein; normal, 5-20 (10 -50) nmol/ min/mg of protein; n ϭ 40] and glycogen [2.7 mg/dl; normal, 0 -10 mg/dl; n ϭ 40] as well as phosphorylase kinase in erythrocytes (218 mmol/min/g of hemoglobin; normal, 100 -300 mmol/min/g of hemoglobin; n ϭ 40) were normal. The clinical, biochemical, and neuropathological findings were described in detail in a previous report. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The patient refused a muscle biopsy. However, to analyze a possible muscle involvement in APBD, skeletal muscle energy metabolism in the patient was measured noninvasively by 31 P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy according to a standard protocol. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Energy metabolism was monitored continuously from the right gastrocnemius muscle at rest, during aerobic and anaerobic isometric muscle contraction at 30% of the force at maximum voluntary contraction for 3 min- utes, and during recovery from exercise. Values for the levels of phosphocreatine (PCr), ATP, ADP, inorganic phosphate (Pi), intracellular pH, the rates of [PCr] ϩ [ATP] decrease per force-time integral, and the time constants for PCr recovery after contraction were normal (data not shown). Thus, noninvasive 31 P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicates normal glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle. Purification of RNA and genomic DNA from deep-frozen blood samples was performed according to standard procedures. The complete GBE coding sequence was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and analyzed by direct cycle sequencing by using an automated fluorescence sequencer (ABI 377; Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). The following primer pairs deduced from the human cDNA sequence <ref type="bibr">12</ref> were used to amplify the complete GBE coding sequence in six overlapping fragments: fragment 1: forward primer 1F, 5Ј-ATTCGGTCCCAGCTAGAGC-3Ј and the reverse primer 1R, 5Ј-TCAGCACATCTGTG-GACGC-3Ј; fragment 2: 2F, 5Ј-CATTGGAGAAAATGAAG-GTGG-3Ј, and 2R, 5Ј-AAGGCCTTTGATTCTTGGTAG-3Ј; fragment 3: 3F, 5Ј-GAGTTTAAGCATTCCAGACC-3Ј, and 3R, 5Ј-AGGCAAACAATCTGCTATCC-3Ј; fragment 4: 4F, 5Ј-TCATTCTGGACCTAGAGGG-3Ј, and 4R, 5Ј-ATGCACTTTTCAAGGTAGCG-3Ј; fragment 5: 5F, 5Ј-AG-ATGAAGACTGGAACATGG-3Ј, and 5R, 5Ј-ACTCACG-TAGGCCTGTGG-3Ј; and fragment 6: 6F, 5Ј-GGAAGAA-AGATATGGTTGGC-3Ј, and 6R, 5Ј-AGCTGTGTGAC-AGTGATAAC-3Ј.</p></div>

To confirm the mutations in the patient and to analyze both asymptomatic daughters as well as normal control subjects, PCR of genomic DNA was performed with the forward primer 6A, 5Ј-CAAACATGAGTGTCCTGACTCC-3Ј, and the reverse primer 6B, 5Ј-ACCAAGCCCATGCGT-AATGAG-3Ј. PCR products were digested with BclI and TaqI and analyzed on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel with 1 ϫ Trisborate EDTA (TBE) buffer at 10 V/cm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Two novel G-to-A transitions in the GBE gene were identified, one at nucleotide 1634 and the other at nucleotide 1661 (nucleotide positions of the cDNA and protein sequence are numbered according to data from Thon and co-workers 12 ) (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>). The first mutation is a missense mutation that changes the CGT codon for arginine at amino acid position 515 into a CAT histidine codon (Arg515His). The second is another missense mutation that changes the arginine codon at amino acid position 524 into a CAA glutamine codon (Arg524Gln). The remainder of the coding sequence was identical to that of the wild-type GBE gene. Both mutations are localized within a region of the human GBE coding sequence (codon 512-528) that is identical to the coding sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Both mutations were confirmed by PCR on genomic DNA from the patient, followed by BclI and TaqI digestion (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">3B</ref>). Restriction enzyme analysis revealed that the asymptomatic daughters with intermediate GBE activity in leukocytes both carry one of the mutations, which thus demonstrates that the two missense mutations were located on different alleles. One was heterozygous for Arg515His and the other heterozygous for Arg524Gln (see Fig 3).</p><p>Both missense mutations were shown to be absent in a panel of 50 unrelated German healthy control subjects, which suggests that they are disease-causing mutations and not common polymorphisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Two novel missense mutations in the GBE gene, Arg515His and Arg524Gln, were identified in the first non-Ashkenazi patient with APBD and GBE deficiency in leukocytes. Two asymptomatic daughters both had intermediate GBE activity in leukocytes and were shown to be heterozygous mutation carriers. We conclude that both substitutions are disease-causing mutations for the following reasons: first, no other alterations were detected in the remaining GBE coding sequence; second, these mutations were not detected in 50 control persons; and, third, the mutations were associated with decreased GBE activity in the asymptomatic daughters of the patient. It is noteworthy that both Arg residues are conserved between the human GBE coding sequence and that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. <ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">13</ref> The present study adds two new mutations to the previously characterized six mutations in the GBE gene (Leu224Pro, Phe257Leu, Tyr329Ser, Arg515Cys, Arg524Stop, 210-bp deletion). <ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">14</ref> Our data confirm, for the first non-Ashkenazi family, that APBDs associated with GBE deficiency and GSD IV are allelic disorders encoded by mutations in the same GBE structural gene. Thus, GSD IV occurs in very different clinical presentations-hepatic (M. Andersen) and neuromuscular forms as well as APBD. The molecular mechanisms underlying this pronounced clinical heterogeneity of GSD IV remain enigmatic and have been discussed in detail elsewhere. <ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">14</ref> Defects in tissuespecific isoenzymes encoded by different genes expressed in different tissues are unlikely, because there is no clear evidence for the existence of isoenzymes of the GBE. Different isoforms of GBE encoded by one GBE gene might exist that are expressed tissue specifically. Differential sensitivities of the mutant enzyme to proteases or to posttranslational modifications in different cell types and additional genetic or extrinsic factors may also contribute to the heterogeneity of GSD IV. It is noteworthy that codons 515 and 524 of the GBE gene, in the APBD family reported at present, were also mutated in 2 patients with GSD IV (Arg515Cys and Arg524Stop) who had progressive liver cirrhosis and failure. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> This region may therefore be a mutation hotspot in patients with GSD IV.</p></div>

The non-Jewish patient described here has two different missense mutations in the GBE gene.

Further studies of the GBE gene in more patients may help in understanding the genotype/phenotype correlation in GSD IV. The molecular basis of APBD with normal GBE activity in leukocytes and peripheral nerves also remains to be determined.</p></div>

They presented with developmental regression, extrapyramidal movement abnormalities, and intractable epilepsy, and they improved with treatment of creatine monohydrate. We report 2 unrelated boys with a creatine synthesis defect and nonspecific presenting signs of psychomotor retardation, behavioral problems, and, in 1, mild epilepsy. Metabolic urine screening revealed elevations in all metabolites, expressed as millimoles per mole of creatinine, which suggests decreased creatinine excretion. This finding led to the correct diagnosis. We propose to include the assessment of the overall concentrations of amino acids and organic acids relative to creatinine in routine metabolic urine screening. van  Recently, an inherited metabolic disorder, caused by a defect in the synthesis of creatine, has been discovered. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Creatine and creatine phosphate are essential for the storage and transmission of phosphate-bound energy in muscle and brain. They are catabolized to creatinine. For maintenance of the body pool, the daily urinary loss of creatinine must be replenished by en- dogenous synthesis and dietary intake. A deficiency of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) is the first inborn error of creatine synthesis reported in humans. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> It results in depletion of body creatine and accumulation of guanidinoacetate. The urinary excretion of creatinine, which is directly proportional to the body creatine pool, is low in defects of creatine synthesis.</p><p>The only 3 patients described thus far presented with developmental delay followed by regression, <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref> muscle hypotonia, 1 extrapyramidal movement abnormalities, <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">3</ref> and intractable epilepsy. <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref> The neurological problems were progressive. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> Supplementation with creatine monohydrate led to considerable neurological improvement but not to normalization. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> Developmental regression, intractable epilepsy, and extrapyramidal movement disturbances are current indications to pursue a creatine synthesis defect. However, considering the small number of patients reported, the entire clinical spectrum and, with that, the range of indications for screening may not be known.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient Reports</head><p>Patient 1 is a boy who presented at 2.5 years because of developmental delay. He could stand with support at 13 months, but at 2.5 years he could still only walk with support. He had no language skills, neither receptive nor expressive. His development was progressing slowly but steadily. Mild temporary regressions were noted during febrile illnesses. The parents of the patient were healthy and nonconsanguineous. There was a healthy sister.</p><p>Physical examination revealed normal height, weight, and head circumference; there were no abnormalities of the internal organs. His behavior was autistic. He did not make eye contact, whereas there was no evidence of decreased vision. He avoided interpersonal interaction. Neurological examination revealed no abnormalities apart from a generalized moderate hypotonia. Ophthalmological examination was normal.</p><p>A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain revealed mildly retarded myelination. Chromosomes were normal. DNA analysis revealed no evidence of fragile X syndrome. Blood ammonia was normal. Metabolic screening of a 24hour-sample of urine revealed a generalized elevation of the concentrations of amino acids, organic acids, and uric acid. Because these concentrations are expressed as millimoles per mole of creatinine, a low creatinine excretion related to a creatine synthesis defect was considered. Serum creatinine concentration was normal (38 mmol/L; normal, 25-75 mmol/L).</p><p>Patient 2 is a boy with developmental delay and mild hypotonia. Independent walking was achieved at 2 years. At 2.5 years, several epileptic seizures occurred during episodes of fever. With valproate therapy, he was seizure-free for 2 years; valproate was discontinued. At that time, his electroencephalogram showed no epileptic activity. At 5 years, he still had poor receptive and no expressive language skills. He was se-verely retarded mentally, hyperactive, and difficult to handle. The parents were nonconsanguineous. They had 2 other healthy children.</p><p>Physical examination revealed normal height, weight, and head circumference; there were no abnormalities of the internal organs. He displayed hyperactive behavior. Although he offered eye contact, interpersonal interaction was poor. Neurological examination revealed no abnormalities apart from minor hypotonia.</p><p>A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain was normal. Laboratory examinations revealed normal creatine kinase, lactate, pyruvate, and chromosomes. DNA analysis revealed no evidence of fragile X syndrome. Metabolic screening of a 24-hour sample of urine revealed a generalized elevation of the concentrations of amino acids, organic acids, sialic acid, and uric acid as expressed as millimoles per mole of creatinine. A creatine synthesis defect was considered. Serum creatinine concentration was low (25 and 15 mmol/L).</p></div>

Shortly before starting treatment, a febrile convulsion occurred in Patient 1. Subsequently, frequent minor seizures occurred, with staring and subtle myoclonus for a few seconds. Electroencephalography revealed multifocal epileptic activity. After 1 month of treatment with creatine monohydrate, the seizures stopped without the use of anti-epileptic drugs. He became less hypotonic and, within 1 month, he could walk without support. His autistic behavior improved. However, he was hyperactive and had a short attention span. Seizures did not recur, but his electroencephalogram still showed multifocal epileptic activity. At 4 years, the boy has not developed any expressive language, but he understands simple sentences. After initiation of treatment, Patient 2 became more interactive and attentive. There was a temporary increase in hyperactivity, but in the course of 9 months his behavior normalized.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Our patients differ from the reported patients with GAMT deficiency <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> in that they had a much milder presentation and lacked specific neurological findings. Their main problems consisted of a psychomotor retardation, developmental dysphasia, and behavioral problems. Both had mild epilepsy with a delayed onset. They showed improvement on initiation of treatment with creatine monohydrate, although, as in the patients described before, <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> they did not become normal. In Patient 1, there was a rapid improvement of motor skills after initiation of treatment. The behavior in both patients improved significantly, but they remained severely retarded mentally, with significant language problems.</p><p>The absence of complete recovery can be explained by irreversible damage acquired before treatment, the persistent elevation of guanidinoacetate, the failure of brain creatine concentrations to normalize, or, most likely, a combination of these. The first issue can be addressed by diagnosing and treating patients early. Guanidinoacetate is neurotoxic in high concentrations. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Further reduction of its concentration through competitive inhibition of arginine:glycine amidinotransferase by additional substitution of ornithine failed. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Cerebral creatine concentrations do not normalize, <ref type="bibr">12</ref> even with higher creatine monohydrate dosages of 600 mg/kg/day. This can be ascribed to the fact that neurons lack an active high-capacity creatine transport/uptake system <ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">14</ref> and that part of cerebral creatine is probably synthesized locally. <ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16</ref> Considering that GAMT deficiency is at least a partially treatable condition, probably more so if the condition is detected early, screening of appropriate patients is important. Screening by determination of serum creatinine is not adequate, because the values can be within the normal range. Schulze and colleagues 3 recommended assessment of cerebrospinal fluid creatine and creatinine concentrations for screening purposes. The most reliable tests for screening are the estimation of guanidinoacetate in urine, plasma, or cerebrospinal fluid by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, <ref type="bibr">8</ref> and the assessment of cerebral creatine concentration by proton MRS. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> In the presence of developmental regression, extrapyramidal movement abnormalities, and intractable epilepsy, these tests are justified. However, it seems hardly realistic to perform the tests in the numerous patients presenting with mental retardation, developmental dysphasia, and behavioral problems, with or without mild epilepsy. As a rule, "routine" metabolic urine screening will be performed in such cases. In both patients, we found a generalized increase in concentrations of all metabolites relative to creatinine, which led to the consideration of a creatine synthesis defect. Thus, we suggest that an assessment of the overall concentrations of amino acids and organic acids relative to creatinine should be included in the interpretation of routine metabolic urine screening results and that, in the case of a generalized increase, the possibility of a creatine synthesis defect should be investigated.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This is the first description of an association between s-IBM, cardiac amyloidosis, and the TTR gene mutation Val122Ile. Unique for s-IBM were TTR and A␤ immunoreactive muscle blood vessel amyloid, and TTR amyloid deposits within vacuolated muscle-fibers. Unusual for s-IBM were the intrafiber amyloid depos-its' being virtually always in plaquette configuration rather than squiggles, 1,2 and a relative paucity of phosphorylated-tau-positive PHFs.</p><p>TTR is a 55-kd, 508 -amino acid, tetrameric protein encoded by a gene on 18q12.1. It is involved in transport of thyroxin and retinol-loaded retinol-binding protein. <ref type="bibr">14,</ref><ref type="bibr">15</ref> TTR constitutes the major amyloid protein in different forms of amyloidosis. <ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">14,</ref><ref type="bibr">15</ref> More than 60 distinct point mutations having been reported. TTR-derived amyloidosis is manifest usually as an autosomal dominant peripheral neuropathy or cardiomyopathy, <ref type="bibr">14,</ref><ref type="bibr">15</ref> in which TTR amyloid is commonly deposited extracellularly in blood vessel walls and perimysium. In patients with the TTR Val122Ile mutation, TTR was identified in cardiac amyloid, <ref type="bibr">9</ref> but A␤ was not sought. TTR amyloid was also found in blood vessels of some other organs, but muscle was not examined. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> The TTR Val122Ile mutation has not yet been found in non-African Americans. <ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">16</ref> In our patient, the following are possible:  1. The TTR mutation made him susceptible to development of s-IBM or was the major cause of it.</p><p>Although no other patients with TTR Val122Ile cardiac amyloidosis are known to have s-IBMlike muscle weakness, it might have been unrecognized or attributed to cardiac insufficiency. 2. There are two independent processes, (a) TTR Val122Ile mutant amyloid of heart and skeletal muscle blood vessels and (b) s-IBM, with possibly a partial influence of one or the other. In the blood vessels, the TTR amyloid probably provoked the A␤ accumulation, because in ordinary s-IBM, immunoreactive A␤ is not detectable there. Similarly, TTR Val122Ile might enhance the s-IBM-determined A␤ accumulation and fibrillogenesis within VMFs. The muscle fiber intracellular TTR accumulation probably was due to its being the Val122Ile mutant, because wildtype TTR does not accumulate within s-IBM fibers 3 (Askanas, unpublished observation, February, 1998). In our patient, the Val122Ile TTR may be bound to A␤, since they colocalized. An aspect of the muscle fiber IBM milieu, such as A␤ accumulation, might have provoked the TTR Val122Ile accumulation there.</p><p>Experimental relationships of wild-type TTR and A␤ were described. In vitro, wild-type TTR can sequester A␤ and prevent amyloid formation. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, wild-type TTR prevents intracellular accumulation of A␤. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> In AD patients, cerebrospinal fluid wild-type TTR is decreased <ref type="bibr">19</ref> but of unknown significance. In general, perhaps wild-type TTR enhances A␤ catabolism while mutant TTR Val122Ile does not, thereby promoting A␤ amyloidogenesis.</p><p>In our patient, the TTR mutation has existed since conception, but both cardiomyopathy and IBM developed late in life, suggesting that aging of the cellular and extracellular milieu might be a contributing factor. Of interest is whether other elderly African-American patients with the Val122Ile allele and cardiac amyloidosis have IBM-like pathology or muscle blood vessel amyloid containing A␤ and TTR. If the TTR Val122Ile allele is determined to be a susceptibility gene for s-IBM, other susceptibility genes should be sought.</p><p>This study was supported in part by NIH grants NS 34103 and AG 16768, and an MDA grant (all to V.A.).

Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed a lobar type of holoprosencephaly and partial agenesis of the anterior corpus callosum. He was treated for craniosynostosis at 7 months of age. All three exons of the Shh gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA of the patient and controls. Sequencing analysis of the polymerase chain reaction fragments, screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, revealed a heterozygous mutation of a T-to-C substitution at nucleotide position 50. This mutation predicted an amino acid replacement of leucine to proline at codon 17 located in the signal peptide of SHH protein. It probably disturbs the translocation of the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum and may lead to holoprosencephaly because of haploinsufficiency of Shh.

(A) By using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product for exon 2 of the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene (GCH1) as a probe, an aberrant band (7.8 kb) was detected in 6 subjects (4 affected members [I-1, II-2, II-4, and III-4] and both twins [III-1 and III-2]) but not in an unaffected sibling (III-3) and a normal control (for individual numbers, see Fig 1A). This abnormal band was not observed in another unaffected sibling (II-3), 2 spouses (I-2, II-5), and 19 other normal control subjects examined (data not shown). (B) By using the GCH1 exon 3-PCR product as a probe, the 7.8-kb aberrant fragment disappeared, whereas a normal fragment (9.0 kb) shown in A was also hybridized with this probe. ␣-Synuclein is believed to play an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD).
