			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Intracellular deposition of the ␤-amyloid (A␤) peptide is an increasingly recognized pathological hallmark associated with neurodegeneration and muscle wasting in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and inclusion body myositis (IBM), respectively. Previous reports have implicated dysregulation of ␤-amyloid precursor protein (␤APP) expression in IBM. Accumulation of full-length ␤APP, its various proteolytic derivatives including A␤, and phospho-tau into vacuolated inclusions is an early pathogenic event. We previously reported on a statistical tendency favoring fast twitch fiber involvement in IBM, reminiscent of the tissue specific patterns of misfolded protein deposition seen in neurodegenerative diseases. To test this principle, we generated an animal model in which human wildtype (WT) ␤APP expression was limited to postnatal type II skeletal muscle. Hemizygous transgenic mice harboring increased levels of holo␤APP751 and A␤ in skeletal muscle fibers became significantly weaker with age compared with nontransgenic littermates and exhibited typical myopathic features. A subpopulation of dissociated muscle fibers from transgenic mice exhibited a 2-fold increase in resting calcium and membrane depolarization compared with nontransgenic littermates. Taken together, these data indicate that overexpression of human ␤APP in fast twitch skeletal muscle of transgenic mice is sufficient for the development of some features characteristic of IBM, including abnormal tau histochemistry. The increase in resting calcium and depolarization are novel findings, suggesting both a mechanism for the weakness and an avenue for therapeutic intervention in IBM.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Human inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most common muscle disorder affecting the elderly. Despite intense efforts to understand IBM, its etiology remains unknown. Sporadic IBM (sIBM) is an inflammatory condition, but clinical and pathological features also support a primary degenerative cause <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. IBM shares several pathological hallmarks with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Deposits of nonmutant AD-associated proteins ␤-amyloid precursor protein (␤APP), ␤-amyloid (A␤), hyperphosphorylated neurofilaments and Tau, ubiquitin, and various shared chaperones and kinases are thought to play pathological roles in the cognitive decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> and muscular failure (3) that define sporadic AD and IBM, respectively. An interesting distinction between neurodegeneration in AD and IBM involves the accumulation of fibrillar A␤ in extracellular brain parenchyma and intracellular myoplasm, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</p><p>Misfolded mutant gene products appear to attack specific brain regions in the various inherited neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, mutant ␣-synuclein causes degeneration of the substantia nigra in PD <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>, specific sets of striatal neurons are affected in Huntington's disease by expansion of polyglutamine repeat within the Huntingtin protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>, and motor neurons are sensitive to mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD) in amytrophic lateral sclerosis <ref type="bibr">(9 -13)</ref>. In Alzheimer's disease, early degeneration preferentially occurs in the entorhinal cortex in association with increasing amyloid load <ref type="bibr">(14 -17)</ref>. In IBM, evidence points to an excess of ␤APP transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> and protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Induction of ␤APP overexpression by myotubes in culture can recreate some of the hallmarks of IBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>. Intracellular inclusions bearing AD-associated pro-teins are relatively sparse, occurring in scattered, nonnecrotic angulated myofibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. These and other data suggest that clinical muscle weakness arises from a more widespread metabolic defect <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. In previous work, we suggested that a more generalized mismetabolism of calcium could be one such defect <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. Excessive calcium could result in muscle weakness and arise from an exaggerated release or leak involving ryanodine receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, reduced sarcoplasmic, or endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) reuptake or influx from A␤-forming pores <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</p><p>In two previous reports, transgenic mice that overexpress the C-terminal 100 amino acid (C100) fragment of ␤APP displayed some of the pathology associated with IBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>. More recently we have shown in humans and in a transgenic mouse line that expresses a non-IBM related mutant ␤-APP under the control of a general muscle creatine kinase promoter that type II fibers are to a modest degree more vulnerable to pathological changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</p><p>To study the hypothesis that ␤APP gene expression, when confined to a specific muscle fiber type, can reproduce both the disease phenotype and defect in calcium homeostasis in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse in which ␤APP production is restricted to fasttwitch fibers through control by a myosin light chain (MLC) 1/3 promoter/enhancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. These mice develop myopathological and clinical features resembling those associated with IBM, including colocalization of immunoreactivities to ␤APP and A␤-sequence-containing peptides, and ultrastructural and histopathological changes that indicate myodegeneration and skeletal muscle weakness. In addition, an alteration in muscle membrane potential and dysregulation of calcium homeostasis was discovered.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generation of transgenic mice</head><p>The complete ␤APP 751 open reading frame (in Bluescript, gift of C. Abraham) was cloned into pMEX-M2-myc3 expression vector downstream of the 800 bp 5Ј flanking sequence of the myosin light chain (MLC) 1/3 promoter (SacI restriction site) and upstream of the Simian virus 40 polyadenylation sequence and the MLC enhancer flanking the 3Ј end (gift of Drs C. Neville and N. Rosenthal, Massachusetts General Hospital). The entire expression cassette containing the promoter, the cDNA, and the enhancer can be isolated as a single fragment using one of the infrequent Srf I cutting enzymes engineered on either side of the cassette (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1A</ref>).</p><p>Pronuclear stage zygotes were harvested from B6/C3F1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Cambridge. MA, USA). The linearized expression cassette was injected into the male pronucleus and between 25 and 30 embryos each were implanted per pseudopregnant CD1 foster mother. After delivery of litters, distal tail samples were collected from each offspring and the DNA was extracted in Hot Shot reagent (2.5 mM NaOH, 0.2 mM disodium EDTA) and neutralized in 40 mM Tris-HCl. Transgenic mice were identified using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based assay. To avoid the amplification of endogenous mouse DNA, we designed the sense primer from the rat MLC 1/3 promoter (5Ј-GCG TGT GTC AAG GTT CTA TTA GGC-3Ј) and antisense strand primer (5Ј-ACA TCC GCC GTA AAA GAA TG-3Ј) from the KPI domain of human ␤APP 751. Both PCR-derived cDNAs generated from transgenic and control mice genomic DNAs and total genomic DNA digested with EcoR1, were electrophoresed and transferred to a charged nylon membrane. Southern blots were hybridized with a probe generated using the 1.2 kb PCR product derived from the MLC-APP751 cDNA construct (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1A</ref>) as template and random priming with ␣-32 P dATP (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA, USA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunocytochemical and histological analysis of skeletal muscle</head><p>Immunohistochemistry was performed on 10 micron-thick muscle sections. ␤APP 751 was probed with 22C11 (1:800) mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Chemicon International; Temecula, CA, USA). A␤ was probed with 6E10 (1:600) mouse mAb (Signet; Dedham, MA, USA). Specific anti-A␤ 1-42 antibodies included a rabbit polyclonal (1:60) (Chemicon International) and a mouse monoclonal (21F12; 1:60) (gift of Dr. Dennis Selkoe, Brigham and Women's Hospital. Boston) to probe for A␤ 1-42 immunoreactivity. Total tau was probed with tau-5 (1:500) mouse mAb (Biosource International, Inc. Camarillo, CA, USA). Immunolabeled specimens were immunoperoxidase stained using a VECTASTAIN avidin-biotin complex (ABC) system (Vector Laboratories, Inc.; Burlingame, CA, USA) and counterstained with hematoxylin.

Prior to testing, the gauge was zeroed and set horizontally in recording mode to measure maximal strength in gram force (g-force). The animal was trained to grasp with either fore-or hind-paw a T-bar or triangular grasping ring, respectively. Using one hand, the animal is grasped about three-fourths of the way up toward the base of the tail and steadily pulled (ϳ1 in/s) away from the ring/T-bar in line with the transducer axis until the grip is broken and maximal force is digitally recorded. Typically 15 recordings were taken for each animal with an intertrial interval long enough to record the data and zero the gauge meter for next trial.

Transgenic founders were backcrossed to B6/C3F1 mice (Jackson Laboratories; Bar Harbor, ME, USA). One female founder gave rise to a line consisting of at least 5 transgenic males nos. 27 and 28 (DOB 6/1/2002), nos. 10 and 15 (DOB 7/20/03) and no. 19 (DOB 7/25/03). One male founder gave rise to at least one transgenic female no. 24 (DOB 6/12/2002). Transgenic 10, 15, and 19 were backcrossed with WT B6/C3F1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transgene-derived expression of ␤APP in MLC-␤APP mice</head><p>Steady-state levels of transgene-derived human ␤APP were determined by Western blot analysis on total protein extracted from skeletal muscle of transgenic mice. Human ␤APP was detected in skeletal muscle extracts from transgenic mice (nos. 24, 27, and 28) aged 2.5 years (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1D</ref>). We detected 4-to 5-fold more ␤APP in skeletal muscle homogenates of transgenic mice compared with nontransgenic littermates. The ␤-amyloid peptide derived from ␤and ␥-secretase mediated ␤APP proteolysis was also detected in total protein extracted from skeletal muscle of transgenic mice (nos. 24, 27, and 28) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1E</ref>) compared with nontransgenic littermates. Age-dependent analysis of transgene expression showed a steady presence of ␤APP in transgenic mice as early as 3 months of age compared with age-matched nontransgenic littermates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1F</ref>). ␤APP levels remain constant throughout development. Monomeric A␤, on the other hand, accumulated in an age-dependent manner, first detected at 3 months of age. Oligomeric A␤ was also increasingly evident in an age-dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1G</ref>). No noticeable difference in ␤APP expression in the brain, liver, kidney, and heart (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1H</ref>) was detected between transgenic and nontransgenic littermates.</p></div>

The same deposits were immunoreactive for antibodies vs. A␤ (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2C</ref>). The proteinaceous aggregates were shown to correspond with large intramyofiber vacuoles easily identified on Gomori trichrome-developed sections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2D</ref>). We confirmed ␤APP immunoreactivity in serially sectioned triceps from transgenic mouse no. 27, where ␤APP deposits (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2E</ref>) were exclusively localized to fast twitch fibers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2F</ref>). Subsarcolemmal inclusions were confirmed by Gomori trichrome staining in a cross section of tibialis anterior of transgenic animal 27 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2G</ref>). The paler cytosolic stain suggests relative mitochondrial paucity, such as characteristic of type II fibers, which are expected to bear the transgene. We next probed for immunoreactive A␤ deposits (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2H</ref>) in serially sectioned hamstring from animal no. 15 and confirmed that A␤ immunoreactivity was localized to fast-twitch muscle fibers. Thus, A␤-bearing myofibers were ATPase 4.6 negative (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2I</ref>) and were fast myosin heavy chain positive (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2J</ref>). We probed for A␤ 1-42specific immunoreactivity using either of two antibodies, followed by thioflavin S staining, in cross sections of hamstring from transgenic animals 27 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2K</ref>) and 28 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2M</ref>). A␤ 1-42 -positive fibers were also thioflavin S positive (Fig 2L <ref type="figure">, N</ref>), suggesting the presence of betasheet structures. ␤APP and A␤ immunoreactivity were not widely distributed throughout tissue, but tended to affect clusters of fast-twitch muscle fibers within discrete fascicles.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The MLC1/3-␤APP transgenic mouse exhibited many of the clinical and myopathological features character-istic of the human IBM condition. Among these changes, ␤APP and A␤ deposition, inclusion formation, centralized nuclei, increased creatine kinase levels, and skeletal muscle weakness with atrophy featured prominently. This is the first demonstration that WT holo␤APP expression in skeletal muscle tissue is sufficient to produce these disease markers in vivo and, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1E</ref>, G, to lead to the age-dependent accumulation of A␤ monomer and oligomers. The expression of ␤APP, then gradual accumulation of A␤ into inclusions in an age-dependent manner, also resemble sIBM, a disorder affecting aged adults, and was orchestrated by the MLC 1/3-promoter/enhancer, which is expressed postnatally <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. These results are consistent with culture-based models of ␤APP mismetabolism in muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>. Furthermore, the observed increase in resting calcium and relative membrane depolarization in muscle fibers of MLC-␤APP transgenic mice represents a mechanism relating ␤APP mismetabolism to altered calcium homeostasis and clinical weakness.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE</head><p>The MLC-␤APP transgenic mouse exhibited many of the clinical and myopathological features characteristic of the human IBM condition. Directed overexpression of human WT ␤APP751 into type II skeletal muscle leads to A␤ accumulation into vacuolar inclusions affecting only fasttwitch skeletal muscle. Intramyofiber accumulation of ␤-amyloid is associated with membrane depolarization and an increase in the level of resting calcium in skeletal muscle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). This is the first demonstration that WT holo␤APP expression in skeletal muscle tissue is not only sufficient to produce these disease markers in vivo, but also when restricted to fast twitch myofibers. The gradual accumulation of A␤ 42 over time into aggregates also resembles sIBM, a disorder affecting aged adults. Our results are consistent with culture-based models of ␤APP and A␤ mismetabolism in muscle. Furthermore, the observed increase in resting calcium and relative membrane depolarization in muscle fibers of MLC-␤APP transgenic mice provides a mechanism relating ␤APP mismetabolism to abnormal excitation-contraction coupling and clinical weakness (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Myocellular degeneration, muscle injury, and atrophy also contribute.</p><p>WT ␤APP expression was selectively targeted to postnatal fast-twitch skeletal muscle by choosing the developmentally sensitive MLC 1/3 promoter/enhancer. In previous models, the mutant ␤APP and mutant C99 fragment transgene products were controlled by a general ␤-actin/ cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and were contrived to accelerate A␤ genesis. Accordingly, they are removed to a degree from the central WT ␤APP-IBM hypothesis. Several features of IBM, however, were not represented in this mouse model, including a lack of endomysial inflammatory infiltrates, small angulated myofibers and dense aggregates of phosphorylated neurofilaments. However, changes in tau expression and conformation were observed in our model (see full text). Further studies are planned to identify the molecular cause of calcium derangement and correct the phenotypic changes by manipulations of calcium handling, amyloid load, and survival signal pathways. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">SPECIFIC AIMS</head><p>The intracellular deposition of the ␤-amyloid (A␤) peptide in skeletal muscle fibers is a recognized pathological feature of human inclusion body myositis (IBM). An abnormal up-regulation of ␤APP gene expression is one possible contributing factor. We found that overexpression of A␤ is detrimental to the ionic homeostasis and viability of myotubes in culture. Since deposits of misfolded proteins are selectively toxic to subpopulations of cells in the brain, presumably based on metabolic vulnerabilities, we reasoned that ␤APP gene expression confined to muscle fiber type can reproduce some aspects of the disease phenotype in an age-dependent manner. We generated a transgenic mouse in which wild-type (WT) ␤APP751 production is restricted to fast-twitch fibers through control by a myosin light chain (MLC) 1/3 promoter/enhancer. Hemizygous transgenic mice (MLC-␤APP) were examined for deposits of ␤APP, A␤ 42 , and inclusions in type II skeletal muscle fibers, as well as electrophysiological abnormalities and calcium deregulation in a corresponding subpopulation of myofibers. Correlation to ultrastructural changes was made. The functional significance of these findings to clinical weakness with advancing age in IBM is discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">IBM-like histopathology in MLC-␤APP mice</head><p>Transgene integration was analyzed in total DNA extracted from distal tail samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genomic Southern blot hybridizations. Most results are reported from a single hemizygous line. Steady-state levels of transgene-derived human ␤APP were determined by Western blot on total protein extracted from skeletal muscle of transgenic mice compared with aged-matched control littermates. Serially sectioned tibialis anterior dissected from transgenic mouse no. 10 showed intracellular deposits of immunoreactive ␤APP (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). The same deposits were immunoreactive for antibodies vs. A␤ (Fig <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). The proteinaceous aggregates were shown to correspond with large intramyofiber vacuoles or tubular aggregates easily identified on Gomori trichrome-developed sections (Fig. <ref type="figure">1D</ref>). We confirmed ␤APP immunoreactivity in serially sectioned triceps from transgenic mouse no. 27, where ␤APP deposits (Fig. <ref type="figure">1E</ref>) were exclusively localized to fast twitch fibers (Fig. <ref type="figure">1F</ref>). Subsarcolemmal inclusions were confirmed by Gomori trichrome staining in a cross section of tibialis anterior of transgenic animal 27 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1G</ref>). The paler cytosolic stain suggests relative mitochondrial paucity, such as characterized type II fibers that are expected to bear the transgene. We next probed for immunoreactive A␤ deposits (Fig. <ref type="figure">1H</ref>) in serially sectioned hamstring from animal no. 15 and confirmed that A␤ immunoreactivity was localized to fast-twitch muscle fibers. Thus, A␤-bearing myofibers were ATPase 4.6 negative (Fig. <ref type="figure">1I</ref>) and were fast myosin heavy chain positive (Fig. <ref type="figure">1J</ref> ). We probed for A␤ 1-42 immunoreactivity using either of two end-specific antibodies, followed by thioflavin S staining, in cross sections of hamstring from transgenic animals 27 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1K</ref>) and 28 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1M</ref>). Several A␤ 1-42 -positive fibers were also thioflavin S positive (Fig 1L <ref type="figure">, N</ref>), suggesting the presence of beta-sheet structure. ␤APP and A␤ immunoreactivity were not widely distributed throughout the tissue but tended to affect clusters of fast-twitch muscle fibers within discrete fascicles. H and E staining of hamstring sections from transgenic mouse no. 27 revealed centralized nuclei (Fig. <ref type="figure">1O</ref>) compared with the normal peripheral location of nuclei in nontransgenic control littermates (Fig. <ref type="figure">1P</ref>).</p></div>
